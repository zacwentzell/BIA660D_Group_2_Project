Was this review helpful to you?, September 18 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for wireless headphones for my work and seriously considered Sony 1000X vs. Bose QC 35. While I was watching so many reviews, I found Sony just updated the 1000X, so I jumped into WH 1000XM2! I tried on both 1000XM2 and Bose QC 35 and honestly think that both are great headphones. Sony 1000XM2 has more features and longer battery life so I am very content with my purchase.

#Features
The touchpad is not a new feature but it is worth mentioning since Bose does not have this feature. Swipe up or down to control the volume. Swipe right or left to change the music. It is very intuitive and easy. You can even press long to activate Siri. Double tap to stop music or take a phone call.
Also, you can cup the right ear and disable the noise canceling and listen to others.

You can check the battery level by the home screen of a smartphone. I have only seen even numbers such as 100%, 70%, and 50% (then I would charge so I have not seen low numbers because of the reason). Maybe the headphone cannot tell the battery level precisely.

#Bluetooth connection
Bluetooth connection is great. I can leave my phone and go to next room without breaking the connection. Switching the devices is not easy though. With Bose, you can connect two devices at the same time. However, with 1000XM2, you need to disconnect one device to use other device.

To switch the device (updated)
1. Go to setting. Bluetooth, then disconnect WH-1000XM2.
2. Go to the other device, hit setting, Bluetooth, then click to connect.

If you don't want to touch the device connected currently but wans to switch the device (for example, 1000XM2 is connected to iPad that is in your bag and you don't want to pull it out), you can
1. Turn off the 1000XM2
2. Turn on and keep pressing power button to activate bluetooth pairing.
3. Go to your device you want to connect. Hit setting, bluetooth, then connect to 1000XM2.

Honestly, I don't mind doing this but I wish we could connect two iOS devices at the same time.

#Noise canceling
Sony and Bose are both excellent noise cancelling (NC) headphones. While QC35 cannot turn off the NC, 1000XM2 can turn of NC. Previous 1000X had a problem with phone call where you cannot hear yourself (so you end up shouting). Sony has fixed this problem and now 1000XM2 let you hear your voice easily with voice focus mode. Making phone call is much easier now.

#Sony headphone connect app
This app allows you to change the setting of NC based on your activity. You can pre-set the level of NC + voice focus according to your activity (rest, walking, running, and transportation). For frequent fliers, it can adjust the pressure too. You can also change where the sound comes from. For example, you can set as if the sound comes from your back.

When I was using 1000XM2 in the office, I used voice focus mode. It was very interesting experience because I did not hear any noise from construction etc but I heard my coworkers voice. Voice is picked up from the mic so it is an interesting experience.

#Gorgeous look
It honestly looks fantastic. I usually pick the black color but I tried gold at this time. The case of headphone had two-tone color (gold in the middle). It looks great. Please look at attached pictures as it tells you more how nice it looks. The headphone has hinges so you can actually make it very small and put it into the case.

#Sound
I cannot speak too much about the sound because I am not a professional musician. However, in my opinion, it sounds absolutely nice. It sounds even better than Bose QC35 but it is just my opinion. With the connect app, you can also change the sound effect such as Arena, Club, Outdoor Stage, and Concert Hall. It is subjective so you might want to try it before you buy, but I am very much satisfied.

#Comfort
This is where BOSE QC35 (quiet comfort) comes into play. WH 1000XM2 is comfortable but I feel my ears are hot after using this for 1 hour. The pad is touching my ears with 1000XM2 whereas QC35 has deeper ear pad. QC35 is much more comfortable for me.

#Sturdy design
I know cracking was the problem with 1000X. So far, it has been OK but I will definitely give updates after using several months (hope nothing will happen). It looks very sturdy and does not make the clicking sound when I open the headphone.

So which one you should buy? I am very happy with 1000XM2 because it has many features and long battery life (30 hours!). However, you may want to try it on before you buy because BOSE is more comfortable.",The best wireless headphone in 2017

The sound out of these headphones blows bose out of the water also. Good app for the headphones. You have to have them adjusted just right to be comfortable for long periods but once you find that sweet spot can wear for hours and hours and the sound is awesome out of the headphones. Hard to find replacement pads though.

I just want to add something for amazon it would be alot better to see reviews from people that pay not a bunch of reviews from people that receive the product for free. I have been noticing alot more vine reviews and they are always high because duh they are receiving a free product this is a shady practice in my opinion.

Was this review helpful to you?, September 23 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are one of my favourite things. They are so well built and are fully sound cancelling. I had the MDR1000x before this and decided to upgrade for the better battery life and app support. I’m going to list the pros and cons I’ve encountered so far and give some recommendations. FYI, I’ve never owned (but have tested) the QC35, beats solo and studio, and own the Senhiessers 550HD.

-Pros-
1) These are top notch in terms of noise cancelation and isolation. The mdr1000x were great and these are the same if not a step up. I could be mowing or trimming the lawn and if I close my eyes I’m in a totally different world. Can’t tell a machine is functioning in front of me.
2) Touchpad: this is such a cool feature. I’m an adoptee of new tech and have been loving it. Sometimes it doesn’t register my hand gestures but I mean it’s not the end of the world. Always registers the second time. The palm over to bring outside noise is super cool, but no one on the other end knows what’s going on. I’d be on a bus and talk to the driver and he’d think I’m on the phone and ignore me. But super cool nonetheless!
3) Battery life, 30-40 hours is Sony’s estimate I believe I’ve been getting very close to that as I go on walks and listen to music while studying overall super happy about it!
4) App is easy to use to pick between different general modes. Kinda cool. One con about this is I use tidal and the music centre only functions with Apple Music (I just use iOS and tidal. Dunno about Spotify or other platforms.
5) These headphones work great wirelessly and last long. But a great pro to them is when you connect the wires you get even better quality! Who knew that could be possible. Another pro is you could use the headphones when dead (without any of the extra bells and whistles) so having the wire on you is the equivalent to carrying another pair of headphones ;)

-Cons-
1) Potential chance of crack? I had the MDR 1000x for months and did not face the crack issues other have. But in my opinion, I totally agree with the video listed where the guy says the cracks are an easy con for the many pros and it’s something you should consider for yourself whether you care enough about that. Are there better speakers out there for the same price range? Yes. Do they have the same functions the Sony has? Not likely (touchpad particularly) is it worth its money? Yes!
2) The bag is the exact same and not very well made in my opinion. Nice that Sony puts it I but I mean you’ll likely want to get one yourself.
3) Connectivity not as (I’ve heard) easy as QC35 or others. Honestly, this isn’t a huge con but I listed it so you can have it in perspective. Do you want to connect to another device? Disconnect from the Bluetooth settings and connect to them on the other device. If the device is in your bag hold the power button to turn off, then continue to hold it after it turns on until it says pairing. I use 5 devices and this hasn’t been an issue for me.

This pair of headphones is well packaged and, in my humble opinion, well priced. You risk it having a small crack, I’ve never had, but for all the extras you get, it’s well worth it. Another thing is Sony did price it lower than the older model so it’s not like they’re charging extra for more functions. The pad sometimes doesn’t register stuff, but I think that’s more me getting used to it than it getting used to me. It's a give and take situation it does stuff for you but you have to learn to function with it and around its flaws.

A few things to improve on would be to have the headphones announce what they’re connected to rather than just staying connected. I believe this won’t be hard for Sony to add through the app, could be wrong, and then again it might not be something they want to do, to begin with. Would’ve loved to see USB type-C on this model. USB-C is the future would be great when small gadgets like this embrace that.

I’d recommend these to anyone who is looking to get a good quality headphone that is versatile with great sound cancelling and new technology. This is and will be for some time my daily driver for headphones.

Hope this helps some of you decide whether it’s a good fit for you — I’ll update this as time goes in regards to my experience with battery life, the infamous cracks and such.",Great headphone for the price - nothing like it on the market (other than MDR1000x)

Unfortunatley that's moot because after a month and a half of regular use the side of the headband cracked. Rendering it useless. Looked online and saw there are MANY people with the same problem and concerns. Someone from Sony even left a comment under a review on Amazon saying the issue has been looked at and ""measures had been taken"".

Contacted Sony about a repair / replace and was told that wouldn't happen. Even though it's their defective product. They are the ones who chose to use cheap plastic on 400 dollar headphones, I'm the one paying for it.

I'm never buying Sony again.",the sound and noise cancelling is very good. Broken headband from regular use (CHEAP PLASTIC)

I read the reviews of the Sony WH1000XM2 and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and could not decide which to choose, so I bought both. I will return the Sony and keep the Bose. Here are the pros and cons:

Sony:
+ Crisper highs and deeper bass (I can't see how anyone says the Bose model sounds better)
+ Better song navigation with the figure gestures on side of right headpiece
- When making phone calls, those on the other end hear more of your background noise than on the Bose (I tested by calling from a land line to a family member who used my Sonys)
- Heavy on the head and hurts to wear for long periods (this was a deal breaker for me)
- Finger navigation feature is too sensitive sometimes - easy to skip/rewind songs by accident.

Bose
+ Great noise cancellation, especially with no music (better than Sony's)
+ Light weight and definitely more comfortable for long periods
+ Best for phone calls (those on other end don't hear much background noise)
- Sound is missing crispness at high and low ends; overall sounds are a bit muffled (it would be great to get Sony's sound on these speakers). If music quality is your deal breaker, buy the Sonys for sure.

In the end, I couldn't get over the uncomfortable aspect of the Sonys. I really preferred the Sony sound, but didn't see myself wearing the Sonys for long periods of time. My primary reason for buying these was muffling office and plane engine noise for long periods of time, therefore comfort was a deal breaker. It also helps that I can take conference calls on these.",Returned these and kept the Bose QuietComfort 35 II

Was this review helpful to you?, December 23 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace my top-of-the-line Sony MDR-1RNC headphones, which have unbelievably great sound quality but they have been acting up lately (very frustrating). Let me first say that out of the box, the new 1000XM2 headphones had a little better noise cancelling than the MDR-1RNCs but the sound quality was not even close to what I was hoping for. The sound of these new headphones was really muddy with way to much mid-bass frequencies. But then I discovered the iPhone/iPad App for the WH1000XM2s which allows you to customize equalization settings (among other things). After reducing the level at 400 Hz (the muddy frequency range), increasing the levels for 1K, 2.5K, 6.3K, and 16K, and then increasing the level for clear bass (the lowest bass setting), I was able to get the nice V-shaped frequency response that make these headphones sound fantastic. No more mud, everything is crystal clear but not harsh, and the bass is really punchy without drowning out the mids and highs. It sounds great for all genres that I’ve tested (jazz, orchestral, pop, soundtrack, etc). I’ve attached an image of my equalization settings for anybody who wants to give what I did a try. Also, the Bluetooth connection works/sounds great with my iPad and iPhone and the battery seems to last a long time before needing to be recharged. So, these are now my go-to headphones for fun listening with unrivaled noise cancelling.",How to make these headphones sound great...

Was this review helpful to you?, March 28 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these daily for a couple of months now so I could really provide a great review. I use these to block noise in loud data centers while on the phone and for listening to music. These replaced a set of Bose headphones that my wife claimed as her own. Overall I like these more than the Bose set and here's why.
Noise Cancelling - my Bose headset is an older set (it's 7 years old now) but the noise cancelling on these is every bit as good as these are for the noise in a data center. If you've never been in a data center, it's a constant cacophony of high speed fans with more 'background' noise than found in normal commercial aircraft. It's the ultimate test for noise cancelling. I put these on and the noise level was decreased dramatically just from the well padded ear cups. Then I turn it on. Blissful near silence. Sure, I can hear some of the ancillary noises, but for the first time I can hear the subtle beeping of computers doing their thing. Way cool.
Next, I fire up my music app of choice - Pandora. I have an eclectic taste in music - U2 to Beethoven, Collective Soul to Moby, and just about everything in between. Unlike the Bose, the overall sound response is crisp, clear, and balanced. The Bose kit seemed a little bass heavy to me. Music is reproduced without hiss, buzz, or other artifacts.
Excited by this, I head home and fire up my lossless music subscription and bring up a collection of Jazz greats. I can hear it all. Wood creaking as the artist shifts their seat. The soft 'clump' of valves. No hiss. And this is through the bluetooth connection, NOT through the included cable. Amazing.
Now, I'm not a crazy audiophile. I've been plagued with tinnitus since birth so much of the subtle points is lost on me simply because of the ringing BUT I've been able to hear things using this set of headphones from music that I've never heard before WHILE in a loud data center.
I've worn these constantly for 10+ hours and aside from a little warmth, they were extremely comfortable. Battery life is every bit of 20 hours with no need to recharge after two days of heavy use.
The app that you can use with these is pretty easy to use and has some unique features. It is able to detect your actions and adjust noise cancellations accordingly. If you are on the street perhaps you want to me more aware of your surroundings. If you are sitting in a chair perhaps you want to block out more noise. This system will detect and adapt automatically. It's pretty effective and actually detects things pretty well. Going for a walk reduced the cancellation levels while sitting in my office increased it. Using the other tools is likely more of a gimmick - different sound stages (arena, outdoors, etc) Meh - not much difference really. Being able to change the directionality of the sound is also fun to play with and is very effective, but I fail to see the real point of this. Other neat features are the ability to control the headset using 'gestures' - tap to pause, swipe to change volume or advance tracks, and cup to enhance conversation. These are all extremely effective and useful. The 'cupping' motion continues to block lower mhz sound (jet engines, etc) while enhancing the sound range of normal human voices. Short conversations are easy even without taking these off. Swiping quickly becomes second nature and is extremely effective.
Bottom line is this - after owning several of the Bose offerings and really linking them, this set does a better job of faithfully recreating the original intent of sound to your ears than the Bose set does. Bose headsets are WONDERFUL and some of the music I listen to does sound better coming from them (I'm looking at you, dubstep), much of the other music is cleaner coming from these. Noise cancelling is jaw droppingly effective. Battery life is phenomenal. Overall the sound quality and technical features built in to this edge out the Bose in an unofficial head to head comparison.",Better sound quality than Bose

Was this review helpful to you?, February 22 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After hours of research on product reviews, I bought this pair of cans. When it arrived, I loved how it looked, felt and sounded. Then I noticed the ONLY ONE yet CRITICAL problem shortly. Whenever I move my head and there is little pressure on my left side of head, there is a squeaky sound and it is annoying. Especially, since you are isolated from noise from surrounding environment thanks to superb noise cancelling function, this squeaky noise from right inside your left cup sounds emphasized. I love the first impression of this product so I am returning back to get a replacement hoping that I have received a defective one.

I will definitely update this review after I receive the replacement product.

UPDATE 1 : I am still waiting for the replacement product to arrive. However, I found another issue meanwhile. When it is connected via its supplied audio cable, I only hear music via left cup only. It leads me to the conclusion that I have received a defective one. I just hope that next one will not have these issues.

UPDATE 2 : Thanks to the greatest Amazon return policy, I received the replacement within one day after filing a claim.

Firstly, this annoying squeaky sound inside the cup still exists. This replacement pair squeaks less than the first one to be honest, however, the problem still remains. If SONY reads this, I have a theory why this happens. I think the speaker cone works like a suction cup or plunger creating the crumbling sound from this flimsy speaker cone material whenever the cup is being pushed toward. Perhaps, few invisible tiny bits of vent holes can prevent this issue. I don't know how it will affect the noise isolation. Please, look into it.

Secondly, when it is connected via its audio cable, it works as advertised. Problem solved. Hooray~.

Lastly, I think this may be a mere software or phone specific (Samsung Galaxy S5) issue. Whenever I change the sound priority option, the headphone turns off and has to be reconnected. I hope this can be fixed by any future update.

I think this is a good pair of cans with great sound, superb noise cancelling and lots of useful functions. Yet, I think its craftsmanship falls a bit short as a premium headphone. Thus my initial 2 star rating remains the same. I am still thinking whether I should keep this or try something else such as Bose QC35. I guess I will find out within Amazon's return grace period.",Feedback after the first one failed then received the replacement.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.

1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.

2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.

Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.

3,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, April 3 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great sound, but the build quality is very bad, and Sony's customer support is truly horrible. Don't buy these.
To preface this review, I purchased these for work, and they never left my office. When not on my head, they were on a headphone rack.
The first big bummer is that, unlike my Bose QC35's, the Sony cannot connect to multiple devices. So no listening to music through the computer but still being able to take calls. That's a huge downside.
Next, the power button ""sank"" into it's slot. Originally, there was a little feedback when you pressed the power button - a ""click"" so to speak. Then the button was really deep with no feedback. I have to jam my finer in and the only way I know I'm doing it right it to wait for the lights to blink.
I called Sony a few months after buying to see about getting the faulty button fixed. After over an hour on the phone they told me it was my fault and that I had abused them. As noted above, these never left my desk, and were either on my head or on a headphone rack. Sony was absolutely horrible.
A few weeks later, the ""ambient noise"" button above the power button did the same thing. It still works, but it's just annoying that something as common as a button doesn't work.
I've gone back to my almost three year old Bose QC35's for the office, and these are my ""iPad shows in bed"" headphones. That brings up the last annoying bit - there's a flashing blue light that you can't turn off, so when wearing these in the dark there's a constant distracting flash that's really bright, both peripherally and on the screen of the iPad.
Overall I'm really bummed, and am stuck with these mediocre defective cans that Sony won't fix. Buy the Bose - they're better.",Broken Buttons & Sony Refuses to Honor Warranty. Avoid these.
4,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, March 19 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost I hope this review those who have been thinking about these headphones to make a good decision whether these headphones are really for you and not compulsively buy the Sony WH1000XM2. So this review will be pretty detailed concerning these headphones. To get it out of the way, yes, these are the best sounding headphones with the most potential on the average consumer flagship market right now. After reading many reviews, I find that not everyone is a tech enthusiast or know holistically about these. So I will address the problems then get into what I like.

Do these suffer from the same cracking issue as the mdr?: From my experience, they have not. The hinges are mostly a plastic finish with some metallic bands encircling the arch of the headphone and no these are not water resistant. This makes the headphones sturdy, however, with a sufficient enough stress, you can crack the hinges on the headphones. You can also hurt the overall durability but stretching the headphone to far constantly. Jimmy reviews did a stress test but that was mainly the outside arch and not the inside hinges, which are durable so far.

Why do these sound different across phones?: Sony really pushes advertising for LDAC, if you do not own a Sony phone or own an android phone with android oreo (any phone that came out before 2017 barring the google pixel). Do not worry, most 2016 flagships will be getting android oreo later this year which will come LDAC. If you do not own an LDAC compatible device then you will notice a DRASTIC change in sound quality. Not to say that phones without LDAC will not sound good but the older your phone, the less bit rates it can transfer to the headphones which affects the quality. Those who own android 8 (or those that are sony fans in general) are the ones touting how amazing these headphones are. I noticed that those with older phones were the ones complaining how they were not up to par, typically, there are some who talked about how they were great but not on Bose level with android oreo 8 phones and sony phones but it was very few.

Are these bass heavy?: These are bass heavy depending on your sound stage and your EQ settings. The Sony's have Arena, Club, Concert, Outside stage or off (neutral sound). Also depends on whether you have DSEE HX active on auto or not (mainly CD quality or not). By the way, in order to customize the sound you need to have an emphasis on stable connection. An emphasis on sound quality will mean that your headphones will optimize the song for you. You will need to use the Sony app (this is not compatible with the MDR as it is a software limnitation). There are two more aps such as the sony music app that you really do not need and another app called smart connect. Essentially controlling what your headphones do at a certain time. Such as noting that at 4:00 you can call a friend that time. Or playing a certain song at a time (which I assumed is where the music center comes into play)

Club: The most bass heavy soundstage of the four. It sounds as if you are right in front of the stereo that is playing. In short, this works with bass dominant EQ settings with high volumes. It can work with mellow songs but it is more geared towards bass.

Arena: Ever been at a music festival or hardstyle's Qlimax? It sounds like you are in the middle. So the music is farther away and this sound stage places an emphasis on vocals and bass (with a far away reverb effect) so you there are 3 drivers that work to create this. This is primarily good for mid bass emphasis and treble heavy songs. Vocals also go well with this but can go with another sound stage.

Concert: As the name implies, as if you at a music concert. Vocal heavy sounds are recommended moreso than bass heavy songs. There is a lot of reverb with this sound stage so prepare to hear a lot of echo which actually sounds wonderful. Bass heavy songs are hit or miss. Beethoven, thomas bergusen, mark petrie, other choir songs work. Treble is nice here too.

Outside stage. Combine club and arena. Good amount of bass and vocals, This can essentially work with any song, it is kind of like off but the best for average optimization as the music feels more ""alive"" so to speak. if you have a balance enough amount of bass and treble with a bit more emphasis on vocals in your EQ, then you will get the most out of this sound stage. The song still sounds less in your face as the club sound stage but still great nonetheless.

Off: How you would listen to any headphone really without any additives and just your EQ.

Are these better than the beats studio 3, Bose QC II, Senheiser px550: IT really depends on your taste.each produce their own sound, some people like the bose for the comfort, if you are comfortable while listing to music, your music naturally sounds better. They are definitely better than beats though, but between senheiser, bose, and these pair, you will not really be disappointed. The willikans are also amazing but their comfortably is abysmal in my opinion.

I mainly chose the Sony because it is not a one trick pony and actually offers a variety of options and features that makes these headphones great. What blows you away is really up to how you customize your headphones, how loud the volume is, your EQ, your sound stage. It never distorts which is nice.

You can control the direction of where the sound comes from as well. This is useful if you are in an area where you need to talk to someone but change the a hip-hop song to feel like it is coming from behind you so you can still hear the person talking. On that note, it is important to mention that using this option, automatically shuts off any sound stage you are using and reverts it back to off. Your EQ will be fine though and DSSE HX will be fine.

The best feature is probably how you can change your noise cancellation in 20 levels and whether you want a focus on voice, not only that, you can have it automatically adjust depending on what you are doing. These are not the first to do this, the nuhera earbuds did this but the technology was early and thus it was not really all that good. Dare I say that Sony has perfected it. At 0 you cannot hear anything while music is playing and you only really hear someone if they are shouting at the top of their lungs or if you get hit by a cup by one of your coworkers to get your attention. At 20, you can hear all your surrounding or you can place your hand over the right earcup to block out sound and lowers the volume (if the volume was high, you still hear the song but it is still faint). Best in ANC right now

You can also activate the assistent by long pressing the right earcup then just speak. It is a bit better than cheaper earphones as you need to wait for awhile. Not as good as bose though as that is near instant but nice enough.

The main bad thing is the comfortability, while these are decent to wear, not as comfortable as Bose but after awhile, your ears can feel pressured by the earcup. You have to adjust the earcup to your ears manually (It is kind of odd to explain) but it fits that way. Even then, you can feel uncomfortable after about an 1 or 3 hours if you're used to them.

Overall, these are wonderful headphones for the money right now. If you do not have a phone that has LDAC then these will still sound great but you may feel as if ""maybe these can do a bit more"". You will not be dsappointed, any additional feature is already in description and features. The atomospheric pressure just makes your song slow down as the altitude gets higher, it solves a problem nobody had but is nice none the less. You will not be disappointed by this pair but still surf around. If you okay with headphones with moderate comfortably but with amazing sound and a variety of features then these will do the job.",A very detailed review: In short wonderful headphones

Pros:

- Sound is incredible. All highs, mids, and lows are clear and crisp.
- Feel and weight is on point. This headset feels good. I can wear it all day without discomfort.
- Battery length is what is being advertised. I could easily run the headset all day without issue.
- People complain about the touch controls but I personally love them once I understood how they worked. The Sony competitor doesn't have the ability to skip tracks and that is an important feature for me. The touch controls are well done and I haven't had a single problem with them.
- Noise cancelling is very good. The headset keeps out all of the ambient sound in my office, which is an incredible feat of engineering IMO.

Cons:

- Even after EQ adjustment, the bass isn't as deep as I'd like. I'd like a little more bass out of these headphones.
- The mic for calling isn't noise cancelling, which I thought that it was.
- Expensive! This headset is very pricey.
- Minor gripe but this thing should be USB C. I don't understand why Micro is still being used.
- The advertised ability to ""quickly disable noise cancelling"" to hear people talking around you is buggy and inconsistent. It is a good idea but poorly executed. Most of the time, I will tap and nothing will happen.","TLDR: Expensive but very high quality construction and sound, a must buy."

They sound and noise canceling are great.

Was this review helpful to you?, November 9 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used both the Bose QC35I and these, and decided to go with the 1000XM2s. Overall, the package of the Sonys feels more premium than the Bose, as far as finish and the technology. I can't speak on detailed comparison of the ANC, but Sony's definitely sounds at least as good as Bose's, and I think it's really cool how it has adaptive sensing as well as calibration for hairstyle/glasses and air pressure. I have no idea how much of a difference it makes compared to Bose, but just the fact that it's there gives it extra value for me. Additionally, the Sony app includes different sound stage adjustments to make it sound as if you're listening in a concert hall, outdoor stadium, etc, and has automatic and manual EQ adjustments. Bose has none of these features.

The Sony also has distinctly better sound quality than the Bose does. It's cleaner and richer, whereas the Bose has somewhat muddied mid-tones and highs. The touch controls on the Sony took a little bit to get used to, but in the end I think they give you much more control than the Bose, and the ability to place your palm against the control panel to allow ambient sound in through the microphones is a cool touch.

Comfort is where the Sony falls short, but just slightly. The ear muffs on the Sony get warm and a bit clammy after extended use and can cause some uncomfortable pressure on the earlobes, whereas I found the Bose stayed away from my ears due to the angled design of the inside mesh. Still, you can expect to wear the Sony's for hours and be comfortable.

Update: I had my first chance to use these on a 13 hour flight to Asia. I have to say that the noise canceling on these is far more comfortable than on the Bose QCs, which on a train ride created that odd, pressurized feeling in my ears. I'm not sure if my ears had just grown used to the noise canceling inverse waveform, but on my flight I felt no discomfort. It's amazing how more comfortable a long flight can be when you cut out that constant drone of engine noise, listen to music, and get slightly more restful sleep.",Great

It is quiet light and can be used for very long hours. So in my opinion this is the best wireless noise canceling headphone you can get.,Very comfortable
8,3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, December 2 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased both this and the Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II to compare the two. I liked that the Sony has an interactive app that shows me how it's calculating the noise cancelling (and it is noticeably improved after the calculation). The app also lets you choose different equalizer settings, including custom settings, which I like because I have hearing loss and I could customize it to my exact hearing needs. The controls are pretty slick, just swiping on the side of the earcup instead of hunting for a button. The sound quality of the music is excellent.

However, here is why I ultimately chose the Bose, and it comes down to two things. Noise cancelling, and advanced sound processing. Re Noise cancellation, I recorded myself in the voice memo app on my phone using the both sets of headphones as the recording device. This simulates what someone would hear when I called them on the phone using the headphones. The noise cancelling in the Bose was excellent, and I only heard my voice. With the Sony, I could hear background noise. The Bose playback sounded like I was talking using a handset, and the Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone.

The Bose iPhone app does not let you calculate anything, and it does not have an equalizer. At first this annoyed me, and then I realized that the Bose was calculating the levels for each song to produce the best sound, so I didn't have to use an equalizer.

Also, when you're wearing the Sony, they are bulky and look geeky on. The Bose is more streamlined to the head. I personally find the Bose more comfortable on over glasses. The Sony seems to have some clamping to shut out the sound, and this is not comfortable over glasses. The Bose has very soft earcups and relies on the noise cancellation instead of physically clamping down on your ears.",Excellent sound and convenient controls

1,3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, October 8 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To begin with, this review is for the XM2 model. You may see two of these Sony Premium Noise Cancelling Headphones listed on Amazon and wonder what the difference is. The XM2 is the newest model for this year and is built with newer materials. Sony may have addressed the headband cracking issue of the previous model in this release. That is not certain, but complaint(s) seem to be very limited on that issue.

I have been wearing noise cancelling headphones for a very long time. Have tried many other brands including Bose and Audio-Technica. The Audio-Technica noise-cancelling headphones are quite good, but outdated technology wise. As for Bose -- some of you may know this already -- but they are generally not a good brand. Most of their innovation costs go into advertising how great their speakers and headphones are rather than into the product itself. The current QC35 headphones are pretty darn good, but I ended up returning them once I heard these Sony headphones.

By far, these are the most advanced and best sounding noise cancelling headphones for the price.

Setup is extremely easy. For my iPhone and iPad, I simply downloaded Sony's companion app which walked me through the setup process. To fully explain how painless it is to start using these headphones out of the box, let me say that I didn't even bother to open the instruction book and instead relied on the app. Even if I didn't use the app, you can pair these headphones with mostly any device by long-pressing the power button.

What I found rather neat is that the headphones have voice prompts which tell you when they are powered on or off, or when connected or disconnected.

The noise-cancelling is as good or better than the Bose or Audio-Technica where it eliminates approximately 95% of ambient noise. You will never obtain complete silence while just wearing the headphones, but once you start playing music, the ambient noise is completely eliminated, thus immersing you completely into the listening experience.

Two terrific features as far as gestures are concerned....

While using the headphones, you can temporarily turn off the noise canceling while cupping your hand over one of the headphones. This allows you to carry on a conversation with someone. Remove your hand and the noise-canceling resumes.

For iOS users, take your finger and press it against one of the headphone cups and Siri automatically activates so you can issue a command.

By the way, the Sony headphones easily paired with my Macbook Pro and iMac.

Music sounds spectacular. The highs are present without being overblown. The bass is present while not being too exaggerated. You don't get that ""muddy"" sound that cheaper headphones provide.

The headphones arrive in a nice oval case along with a USB charging and separate headphone connecting cord.

I realize that some may be concerned about the reports of headphone band cracking that was reported on the previous model. This was a concern of mine as well. Looking at this new model, the complaints of cracking seem to be very rare and if you look further into them via an Internet search, perhaps limited to a specific individual who is repeating the complaints on many sites. I don't want to fully make that accusation as I am not completely certain, but I was just not able to get a substantial amount of evidence to back up the claims of this model having headband issues. Sony has stated that this new model is made of newer materials and I am assuming it was done to address the problems of the prior model.

Let's just say that I have seen no cracking issues with my headphones.

THESE are the ultimate noise-cancelling headphones. Do not hesitate to pick these over other brands. You will be amazed by their performance.",THESE are the ultimate noise-cancelling headphones!

For a device at this price point, that's just too big a flub to tolerate. Second, the Android headphones app seems to choke on these (at least when connecting to a Sony smartphone).

I liked the features of the headphones over the other brand. I've use the older version of the bose and loved them so much I wanted some bluetooth ones. I did a lot of research and read/watched reviews. Now only a few days later and I need to return them.

Pros-
1) Very good noise cancelling when listening to music or watching videos.
2) Great features like mute, ANC sensitivity, app, and gesture controls.
3) Battery life.

Cons-
1) White noise. I got white noise when not listening to anything. I got even more white noise when not listening to anything and plugged in with the cable.
2) Ears got warm. Couldn't keep these on longer then a couple of hours before becoming uncomfortable. I've used bose for 15-18 hours without problems.
3) Besides my ears getting warm, the headphones are a little tight on my head. Could tell if that's why I got headaches or the white noise.
4) My ears also touched the inside of the cups. There isn't a lot of room inside the cups for your ears.

Conclusion-
I want $350 headphones to be comfortable and not get hot. The features are great but I want comfort too. I guess bose had the correct name for their product . . . it's in the name.

I finally decided to try it out, even though the in-store units I tried on were quite frankly terrible. I was very surprised, pleasantly so. The adaptive sound or sense engine works extremely well, exceeding my experience with the Bose QC35 and Bose QC20. For the QC35, I primarily could just not get a good seal and had sound leaking in as a result. I am very pleased with the sound quality, comfort, and noise cancellation ability of the WH-1000XM2. It doesn't blow anything out of the water if you have previously owned any Bose ANC unit, but it is an improvement in every way but one (including the touch-interface, which far outstrips the Bose units in ease of use).

The microphone quality is absolutely horrendous. The moment I attempted to
call someone, they muted me and told me I sounded like an incarnation of death and white noise. I thought it might just be an exaggeration, but after recording myself using the unit and the phone microphone, I can safely say that the WH-1000XM2's outbound voice quality is on par with an extremely cheap knockoff one could find at a dollar store. I am not sure if it is a defect or what, but I was definitely disappointed that one of the marketable features was not remotely serviceable in a completely silent room. Still, I didn't buy it for the microphone, and the rest of the features that this headphone comes with is well worth the price.","Satisfied, but a bit disappointed"

The noise cancelling itself, at least after adaptation, is as good as the Bose. It's probably not better, but it still has a leg-up on the Bose due to the better passive noise cancelling. Just wearing these block out more of the high frequencies (passed the ANC range), so these end up being noticeably better.

They're very comfortable, priced $50 less than the Bose, stylish, lightweight, lots of features. I would definitely recommend these over the Bose assuming it doesn't have the headband cracking issue that the MDR-1000x had. So far I haven't seen nearly as many reports of headband cracking on these.

One thing I wish they'd done something about was the ability to avoid pressing the touch controls when moving the headset on and off your head. That can get annoying if you're not careful. Now that I'm aware of the flaw it's pretty easy to avoid though.

Be aware that these headphones don't support simultaneous bluetooth devices. You'll have to manually disconnect from one before connecting with the other. That's not a big deal for me since I'll only want to use these with my phone, and god forbid I'd have to hold the bluetooth icon in the notification shade to bring up the bluetooth settings (NFC is overrated for the same reason).

The last thing to mention is the difference in Bluetooth codec between the Bose and Sony. Bose supports only AAC as a high-def codec, whereas Sony supports LDAC (of course) and AptX (thank god). Check the hi-def codecs your device supports before choosing a headset.",Easily better than Bose

Was this review helpful to you?, October 31 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing—and expensive. After much research and debate, I decided, if I were going to get a pair of noise cancelling, I would get a pair that was the best at it. My choice came down to the WH1000, MDR1000 or QC35. Through my research, most reviews seem to favor both Sonys over the QC35 for noise cancelling. And, noise cancelling is most important to me. Again, through my research online, not hands-on, the Sony’s and QC35 are fairly comparable with only a slight edge to Sony. With my choice narrowed to either the WH1000 or the MDR1000, I ultimately chose the WH1000 because of what I read about potential creaking with the MDR1000. I could not get a sense of how wide spread the issue was so I decided to just go with the newer version and hope for the best.

The noise-cancelling is outstanding. I initially put them on in my office with no audio and someone taking a call just outside my office. I put them on my ears, turned on the NC feature, and all outside noise ceased. Im fortunate enough to have an office directly by a door that frequently opens and closes, people walk by quite often, the office AC is fairly loud and drones, and people often take calls at their desk. With no audio and NC active, I hear almost nothing. By “almost” I mean, I hear only voices occasionally but they sound like a barely audible mumble. With audio playing at roughly 40% to 50%, I hear absolutely nothing. I had someone talk normally just beside me—I couldn’t hear them. I snapped my fingers directly beside my ear—I couldn’t hear it at all.

I wear these off and on throughout my work day for a total of about 6 hours in the office. With my attention on work and listening to audio, I forgot all about them being on. They are comfortable and I had no problem wearing them for long periods of time. The ear pads are soft and my ears didn’t get hot.

I will end by saying, if noise cancelling is what you are looking for, these are excellent. I'm not a big audiophile. To me, the audio either sounds good enough or bad. These sound just fine to me.",I would get a pair that was the best at it

Was this review helpful to you?, November 1 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess I'd give these 4.5 stars if I could, because there are a couple of annoying issues with them. But having played them a lot over the last few days since receiving them, here are my thoughts in the hope that this may be helpful for someone like me, who is not an expert in anything. But I do enjoy music quite a lot.

Sound - 5 stars. This is what matters most, and this is what is the most subjective. That being said, I've owned quite a few headphones and earbuds over the years, and I am really enjoying these. To me, Bose products are somewhat overrated, and these sound better than the QuietComforts to my ears anyway. Of course the sound can't match high-end wired headphones connected to expensive output equipment, but considering that these are going without the wires, it's very hard for me to find fault with them. Warm overall sound, very good clarity, nice even bass without distortion. Excellent.

Build quality - 5 stars. They look and feel very solid. I got the gold ones, which are really more of a tan color, but really nice. Kept in the hard case that comes with them, I believe they will last a long time.

Comfort - 3 stars. After about an hour, they start to hurt my ears somewhat. That's been my experience to some extent with every pair I've owned, but hopefully I will get used to them over time. I find myself adjusting them quite a bit to get more comfortable. The ear cups are pretty tight, which obviously helps with:

Sound Isolation - 5 stars. My gym has a lot of noise, but these block out about 90% of it. I haven't been on a plane with them yet, but I think they will be just fine.

Features - 4.5 stars. I like being able to control everything by touching the sides of the headphones. But the right side volume, pausing, and skip ahead functions are very sensitive and take some getting used to. The two buttons on the left ear cup are small and hard to find by touching them, frequently causing me to hit the wrong one. The app (at least for the iPhone) has a lot of functionality, and I really like the customizable equalizer. That really makes a big difference for me. There are lots of other things (everything pretty much) that you can do from the app. Pretty cool. Other reviewers have mentioned problems with the app, but not me. There are lots of other features that are of questionable value to me personally (sound position, atmospheric pressure, virtual sound, etc.), but may be useful to others. As far as technology goes, these seem to be way up there.

Bluetooth/Pairing 4.5 stars. It pairs very easily to up to eight devices. The range is very good also. I live in a pretty decent size single level house, and I can go anywhere with no signal degradation. Even outside, I can wander pretty far, no problem on the porch or outside deck for example. However, switching from one device to another is an unnecessary pain. You should be able to connect to two devices at a time. Minus a half star for that.

Battery - 5 stars. So far, so good. After 10 to 15 hours, battery level is still ""medium"".

For a long time I put off getting wireless headphones, fearing that I would have to sacrifice sound quality for convenience. Now you can have the best of both worlds.",Best of Both Worlds
5,7 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, March 16 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are researching which noise cancelling headphones, let me save you the time because I've already done it for you. I was first sold on the Bose Quiet Comfort QC35 II's. In fact, I wasn't really aware there was a solid competitor, nevertheless a superior product. But like any of my other tech/gadget purchases I spend hours reading reviews, watching YouTube reviews, etc. It wasn't until I started my research that I even knew Sony had a direct competitor for the Bose QC's. In fact about 9 out of every 10 reviews rated the Sony's either just a step above if not dead even with the Bose. Most all of the reviews stated that the only area they found the Bose to be superior was in comfort (they are a bit lighter and the design of the ear cups don't tend to make your ears as warm,) FULL DISCLOSURE: I have tried the Bose on in the store but not side by side with the Sony. So while I may not be qualified to do a true head to head comparison in my personal opinion (I have used both, just not at the same time), the research I have done all points to the Sony.

Now, on to what I can tell you about them after using them. #1 - the touch function on the ear cup is pretty cool. I plan to primarily use these in the yard while mowing/edging/etc and being able to reach up quickly and up the volume or change to the next track with a quick swipe is pretty nice. The fewer times I have to reach in my pocket to find my phone and change things the better. Yes... Bose has buttons that do this... but having the touchpad to me is a bit easier without having to learn/know where the specific buttons are at all times. #2 - the ""pause and listen"" function is outstanding. When using them, if you cup your hand over the right ear cup, the noise cancelling ends and the mic turns on to allow you to hear outside noise. This is great if I'm working in the yard and stop to talk to a neighbor or the wife for something brief. Obviously for an entire conversation I'd just pause them and take them off, but just being able to hear something quickly and let go and go back to action to me is an awesome feature. #3 - the ambient noise settings/adjustments are great. The headphones can sense your activity (idle, walking, running, etc) and will adjust for ambient noise accordingly. You can also have the headphones focus on speech and drown out other ambient noise. I tested this feature out while the wife was watching TV. Its strange to not hear the sounds of cars and other usual noises but hear them talking well. I found that I could no longer hear the dishwasher running or background noise on the TV, but as soon as my wife said something or a character on TV spoke, I could hear it perfectly. I don't wear headphones at work, but I imagine in an office setting this would be really nice.

I'm really looking forward to a day in the yard with mowers running and edgers and trimmers and just being able to listen to my favorite music instead. I'm used to having in earbuds that pull out of my ears if I turn my head too quickly. I'm excited to use these moving forward!",I've Done the Research for you... Sony > Bose

Was this review helpful to you?, February 17 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for noise cancelling for 2 main reasons(among other reasons) 1. Travel to my work deployment assignments, 2. Use them as a work tool/protection for my ears.
I do contracting work for the military so wherever they go i have to go. Having said this... Military planes are not built for comfort(or quietness)and if you've been inside of a C17 or C5 aircraft then you know that cabin noise is huge (they're not quiet at all), you literally have to yell to the person next to you if you want to converse. Also working in aviation field with jets coming in and out every couple of hours will hurt your ears. Add to this that you're trying to relax or sleep in your tent and now you have noisy neighbors..etc..
I also have an above normal loud car (custom exhaust) so this is where I tested my Sony WH1000XM2.
While driving my car to work (loud exhaust,floor sound deadening removed, no a/c so widows slightly down and air noise also coming in) I decided to test these headphones with the Noise Cancelling on and OH MY!! What a sweet difference! I could comfortably drive and listen to music and it felt like I was in a quiet room. I could only feel the vibration of the car and the road feedback as I drove but absolutely no noise. Even with the loud exhaust I could even use Google assist thru the headphones to activate apps such as IHeart radio or even just say an address to navigate and it did it with no problem and without me having to take my hands off the steering wheel. I have also made phone calls thru the headphones while driving and also while just walking around and the quality, detail of voice in the calls is impressive.
I used the Sony phone app to adjust the ambient sound levels I want to let in just so that I can listen to music but still want to be able to hear outside voices. Just as I am typing this review I am sitting at the car dealer(with my headphone on and listening to music) servicing my wife's car and the service advisor has come twice to speak to me and I have been able to hear him with no problem and with the headphones on. It's truly amazing! I really love these headphones!

In terms of comfort I honestly don't have any complaints. I guess I must have smaller ears because they absolutely feel very comfortable even after an hour of use I don't feel any discomfort to where I feel like taking a break from them. My ears dont feel weird because of the NC. I've heard mixed reviews about this and how people change the ear pads to make them better but in my case I feel they're excellent.
The headband part is also cushioned and does not brothers me at all even after an hour or two of wearing them.

Sound quality. I think these headphones are very well balanced. Voices and guitars sound so clean, crisp and defined(I listen to all types of music). Bass levels and drum punch is just right from factory settings. I did play with the different EQ adjustments (Arena, Club, Concert Hall.. etc) on the Sony app and I think factory settings are on point. I think i just added 1 or 2 notches on the Bass and thats it. I have been able to really hear/distinguish more detail in my everyday music (same songs) that i didnt know it was there. It's like ...where did those Instruments or where did those riffs came on? I had never heard that in that song.. it's really satisfying.

So far I've used these headphones for about 7 days and I am still on my initial charge. Use has been aprox 2 hrs each day and when i press on the battery level check it still says battery level high. I haven't used them 100% on noise cancelling though, maybe that has to do with how long the battery lasts.","Wow! Sound quality, comfort, Amazing Noise canceling & adjustability"

Was this review helpful to you?, February 9 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones partly because I wanted a new pair of nice headphones, and partly because I had a 17 hour international flight coming up. They do not disappoint on either front.

The sound quality is wonderful. I would encourage you to go to a physical store to compare these to the competition. Compared to the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 and Bowers and Wilkins PX, this was the pair that I fell in love with.

They are also remarkably comfortable. I don't think I have ever had a pair of headphones fit so well. Even after wearing them almost non-stop for the entire flight, I felt virtually no strain on my head.

Speaking of that flight? I had a small child sitting behind me, which is usually a recipe for disaster. I didn't hear him once, and it wasn't because he was well behaved (I knew when he was throwing tantrums because I would feel him kicking my seat, not because I could hear him.) So on top of the excellent audio quality, the noise cancelling is also top notch.

I am stopping short of 5 stars because of the weird Bluetooth pairing. You can only pair with one device at a time, which means if you want to switch between devices you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and manually disconnect, or shut the headphones off and restart them in pairing mode. Compared to every other pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned, this is draconian. In addition, if you plug the headphones in to charge, they shut off and you cannot pair them with anything until you stop charging them. I don't know if the analog cable still works while charging, but it's kind of an annoying drawback.

However, once you are connected there are 0 issues. The connection is very strong; I can comfortably walk into another room 40 or 50 feet away from my iPhone and not have any drops. The battery is excellent, even with wireless and noise cancelling on. They lasted the entire flight + layovers without any problem, with some breaks in between (probably at least 20 hours of use.) They seem to charge quickly as well.

The carrying case is a nice touch, it's very sturdy and I never worried about the safety of the headphones while they were getting backpacked around Thailand. All in all I'd say do your homework, but if you buy these headphones you won't be disappointed.","Wonderful sound, dreamlike comfort, with somewhat annoying bluetooth pairing."

The battery lasted the entire time (and ANC was on), and I still show 20% battery (though, I imagine it’s a bit closer to 10%), and I was playing music or video for the vast majority of the trip.

At first I thought the “cup the right ear to pause/turn off ANC” would be a gimmick, but when trying to listen for announcements on the plane or in the airport, it was really useful.

I’m also a big fan of the control gestures on the right side. I have AirPods that I use for my general wireless usage (walking around/commuting to work), and the double-tap to pause/play action is identical. I also appreciate there being an easy way to skip/reverse tracks and to raise and lower volumes.

I typically don’t bother with third-party apps for EQ stuff, but out of boredom I was messing with it this trip and found that tuning the settings can give off great results. That said, I was very satisfied with the audio quality as-is.

The feature that allows the ANC to balance based on air pressure/altitude seemed to be really good, but that could just be placebo.

Speaking of ANC, it’s jusf fantastic. I know there are some complaints about it turning off when not in use (you have to plug something into the line-out to keep it active), but since I prefer my own traveling playlist over white noise, this hasn’t been an issue for me. Needless to say, the crying baby sitting two rows behind me in my 10-hour return flight from São Paulo to the United States didn’t bother me, which was nothing shirt of a miracle.

The included carrying case is great. Just don’t do what I did and leave it someplace in an airport in Brazil. Song does sell replacement parts, but they are expensive, relatively speaking ($60 for a case, $35 for a color-marched headphone cable). That’s my fault for leaving them, not Sony’s, but I thought I’d mention it.

Connectivity with my iPhone X and iPad Pro was great. It also works perfectly with my Apple Watch (if you want to use that to control playback). Pairing isn’t as instaneous as using W1-chip headphones (AirPods, Beats Solo 3 Wireless and the new Beats Studio 3), but it’s fast nonetheless. You do have to disconnect from one device before pairing to another (simply pairing won’t work, you need to disconnect the other device first), which is a mild annoyance. I would love more flawless device switching or support for multiple BT connections.

I’ve also used them with a mid-2017 MacBook Pro, a mid-2017 iMac 5K, and a late-2016 Surface Book with great success. I usually don’t use noise canceling headphones at work because too many people yell at me (wired Song MDR-7506s have been my default pick for years now), but these are excellent and especially convenient when trying to do work or even a quiet conference call from the airport lounge or the speaking room at a conference.

I can’t speak to long term durability yet, but so far these have more than met my expectations.

As far as comfort, I haven’t done a direct comparison with the Bose (the last time I used the Bose was close to a year ago), but these didn’t bother me, even after 10+ hours of continuous use.

From a pure sound quality point of of view, there are probably equally good or better options for less money on the market, but the battery life and excellent ANC makes these ideal for travel.",Fantastic for Frequent Flyers
9,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 27 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones mostly because my new phone doesn't have a headphone jack. I commute via the subway every day, and it's nice to be able to listen to music on occasion without having to worry about wires. These headphones have been great so far and I can't really think of any substantial downsides. Others have done the in-depth sound and NC comparisons against Bose and Sennheiser, so I won't do that here.

For commuting on trains and buses, these are fantastic. The noise cancelling is excellent, to the point where I've almost missed my stop because I couldn't hear the announcement. I've had a couple times where I've been in a cramped compartment with people talking and it becomes instant silence when I turn these on. The sound quality is also great. The low notes are very full without overwhelming everything else. I'm also hearing subtleties in my music that I haven't noticed before. I listen to a lot of rock, some electronic, and some lo-fi stuff, and these have been great with everything. Build quality is solid; I haven't once been concerned about cracking in the headband, but I treat these very well. I've had these for a couple months and I've only had to charge them twice.

The only annoying thing I can think of with these is the earcup controls. It usually works well for volume, pausing, and switching tracks, but not 100%. There are times I'll swipe to turn up the volume, but it pauses instead. Or I try to forward a track and it pauses. Very minor thing that's not a dealbreaker by any means, but still annoying.

Overall, these are solid headphones that I would recommend.",Comfortable and great sound

I've come a long way from the rattling Skullcandy Skullcrushers of middle school, or the weird ass Sony behind the ear looping ones with the orange ear foam. These are so comfortable I wear them to sleep, so sweet in their sound that I find my body gyrating and head bopping in places where it is surely seen as inappropriate but I just can't help it - the sound is too good. I love the controls and sometimes just flick to skip or cup it to hear around me and giggle with how intuitive it is, although yes the responsiveness of tapping to play and pause can be fickle at times.

Battery is incredible, and I haven't had anyone say that they couldn't hear me when I take a call on them. The days of me crooking my neck in order to mush the phone to my shoulder are over. I can't tell if the app truly works that takes into account atmospheric pressure or personalization of sound to you, but the placebo effect of the slick presentation does put a bougie ass smile on my face.

Build quality is cool, though I do wish they felt a little tougher.

I've never paid such a grand amount for a piece of audio tech, but this feels well worth it. Like two little pudgy cherub hands caressing my ears and projecting heavenly sounds straight to my auditory cortices.

The decision is going to come down to your priorities. Sony's headphones overall sound better, especially with dance or bass-heavy music. If you have FLAC or ALAC tracks, you'll notice the Sony sounding better since they support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which is more advanced and uses higher bandwidth than Bose,

However, if you're heavily invested in the Android ecosystem and need the headphones to travel, the Bose are more comfortable and have better controls as the touch controls on the Sony are hit and miss. The built-in Google Assistant on the Bose is actually very helpful once you learn it's capabilities.

I work in a small office with several other folks, one of which in particular has a tendency to talk at length about random stuff at times when I really need to concentrate on work.

Loud sighs, sliding down in my chair behind my monitors, mumbled oaths and other unsubtle hints fell on deaf ears, and so to maintain an otherwise good relationship with this valued colleague I started looking for a solution, which lead me to a comparison of noise cancelling headphones.

As others have noted, these are fantastic at making the outside world go away.

On testing with my wife, I at first suspected she was having fun with me and just moving her lips - hand over the right headphone suspends the noise cancellation and I could hear her deliberately loud and goofy shrilling. Visualize Xena Warrior Princess battle cry.

At work, with or without low level music, my problem is solved and I can cheerfully donate a couple of minutes being a good listener here and there, knowing I can raise my shields at will.

Others more qualified to speak on sound quality may find fault with these, but to me they sound fine, particularly after adjusting various settings in the Sony Connect app for my phone.

At home, I've enjoyed using these with my Roku - I use the ""private listening"" feature on the Roku phone app to accomplish that.

I've worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort, and find the ear and headband padding adequate.

I like the gesture control and find it easy to remember and use. The ""grab the right headphone to listen"" thing is especially useful, and I make use of it frequently.",Great noise cancelling - Also works well with Roku App

It becomes intolerable over time, and after trying several cheap noise cancelling headphones, I took a chance and coined up these Sony's. I'm quite pleased. These are comfy enough to wear for several hours of the day, even when wearing reading glasses. They offer some modicum of a physical barrier to noise, so they help quite a bit even when Off. This is important for any noise cancelling headphone, and these Sony's have a reasonably good shell structure for blocking some sound passively. When the Noise Cancellation is On, I get to enjoy near total quiet where I normally sit, and I get plenty of protection when I go in and among the computers to do work up close to the whirring and buzzing cooling fans, which can be quite loud - up to 90 dB up close. I also used then while being driven around they do a great job at reducing regular car / freeway noise. They are robust but a tad fragile. I treat them like the sensitive electronic instruments that they are, and so should you. Protect them and they will serve you well. Sound quality is quite adequate for my needs - but this is not the true strength of this device.

Was this review helpful to you?, September 22 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Bose QC35 headphones for about a year and really like them. However, I've seen such generally very positive reviews for the Sony MDR-1000X phones that, when this new model came out, I had to give them a shot. Since I was already very satisfied with the Bose, I knew that the Sonys had to be something special for me to keep both headphones.
When I received the Sonys and unpacked them, I was really excited to try them. The first thing I noticed was that the comfort level was several steps below the Bose. They felt heavier (which they are), tighter on my head, did not completely envelop my ears, and immediately felt too warm on my ears. Comfort is a very important factor to me, so I knew that the Sonys would have to be outstanding compared to the Bose on other factors.
So, let's go down the checklist:
1. Build Quality - As anyone who reads Amazon customer reviews of the MDR-1000X will see, cracking of the headband was a substantial issue, with associated poor customer service responses from Sony. I can find no mention that the issue was resolved on the new phones, although time will tell.
2. Noise Cancelling - Bose has been at the forefront of this for many years, but Sony has clearly caught up. However, for me, I needed the noise cancelling to be substantially better on the Sonys for me to keep them over the Bose. Although the Sonys have more noise cancelling options, I could not detect a marked improvement over the Bose.
3. Sound Quality - This is probably the most subjective factor under consideration. After a few hours of A/B comparison of the two headphones, it turned out that I prefer the Bose. To me, they have a cleaner sound with better instrument separation.
4. Features - Sony clearly outperforms Bose on this factor. From the many options on the Sony app, to the touch controls, to the Quick Attention Mode feature, it is obvious that Bose has a lot of catching up to do.

So, for me, the Sony advanced features are just not enough for me to use them over the Bose. Many thanks to Amazon for making the return process so easy.",Comparison of Sony WH1000XM2 and Bose QC35 Headphones
8,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 1 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony vs Bose:
I had a long battle on which to choose and for my uses, I think the Bose suit me better.
The Bose are more comfortable to me, I like physical buttons and dont need gimmicky features that the Sonys have. I can pair the Bose more easily and can pair up to 2 Bluetooth devices (not just 1) to the headphones.
The Sonys would be a better choice if I wanted slightly more bass/punch as I listen to a lot of Hip-Hop/Electronic music but even then the difference to my ears wasnt light years ahead of the Bose.
It comes to personal taste on the look, comfort and sound really. The Sonys do have better battery life from what Ive heard (20v30 hours) so that is definitley a plus. All in all, If I had only 1 pair of headphones to use, I might like these better...but If I want bluetooth and great noise cancelling that is easy to use and straightforward, Ill take the Bose . I also own Audio Technica ATH50s and Sony MDR-1s that are amazing for listening through media with Aux jacks which is still the way to go if you want the best quality sound.",These are great but I bought the Original QC35s instead

Was this review helpful to you?, October 29 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a nice design, the sound is awesome, the app is also pretty cool. I researched these headphones as much as I could before buying. In all, most reviews are pretty spot on. However, one thing that I really didn't find mentioned at all was how bad the noise cancelation is on a bus. I ride a city bus and we hit some rough roads sometimes, the noise cancelation cannot adjust to all these bumps. I thought at first the headphones I had were defective, so I contacted Sony and they sent me a new pair. Again, on the bus ride to work and home the headphones sound like crap.

Because I really do like the sound of these headphones I am deciding to keep them. These are still top notch sounding headphones and the app does help with customizing to your likes. But, I cannot give it 5 stars because of the noise cancelation issue on the bus. I also don't want to give it less than 4 because I do really like them. My bus ride isn't that long so I just decided that I would turn off the noise cancelation during my commute. So just beware if you commute on a bus and the ride is long these headphones will disappoint you and you will have to go through this 2 week process with Sony to get a new pair sent to you.

@Sony - please test these on bumpy roads and make adjustments to any future pair.",Solid headphones but it does have some flaws

While the Bose were definitely more comfortable and the case was large enough to fit the charging cord and headphone jack, the sound did not quite measure up. I did like the on/off switch of the Bose headphones better and the Bose app, but I love the Sony headphones for the following reasons. The sound is phenomenal...it's transforming. I took them on a recent flight and it was like being in another world...no noisy discussions or engine noise, just a beautiful series of sounds that volleyed from one ear to the next. It's easy to change tracks, adjust volume, or stop play by simply swiping or tapping the outside of the right earpiece. The Sony app is fairly easy to use, too, including a way to adjust if your connection cuts in and out. I didn't experience that with the Sony, but did with the Bose.

I was surprised that these headphones actually have a great spatial sound. The noise canceling is on point.

It has an adaptive noise canceling feature that's good, but it audibly alerts you when it changes. Not a big fan that, so I might turn it off. I have to admire the app and the headphones for actually guessing what I'm doing and where I am. It's a bit spooky, to be honest. Haha

- There is background noise from environmental sounds (e.g. talking), but 2 people talking versus 10 people talking will barely change that background noise level. Even a slight background style music going will drown out those environmental sounds.

Every functionalities work. One of the feature that I love the most was the quick attention mode where you can cup the right ear and the music will pause to let you momentarily hear the person you're talking to. I have come to love this feature so much that I would use it everytime I use the headphone.

Unfortunately, a few days ago, the feature no longer work. The quick attention mode stop registering my hand. I've tried factory resetting the headphone multiple times and the problem persists.

It’s only go downhill from here. I started having Bluetooth connection problem. The dang headphone just doesn't wanna connect to my iPad for some reasons, but I can connect to my iPhone. Furthermore, the noise canceling functionality, for some reasons, got pretty inconsistent thereafter.

I've decided to return this headphone. Such a disappointment. The headphone didn't even last for 2 months.",Really good headphone but too many issues

I was seriously impressed. I could tap my fingernails on the table I was sitting at and not be able to hear the sound. Wow!

Unfortunately I sent them back for a few reasons.
1. They're heavy. I couldn't wear them long without pain in the crown of my head.
2. The deal breaker is that they can't be used strictly for noise cancelling (the whole reason I purchased them) without 'hacks'. The power save feature shuts them down after 5 minutes unless they are physically connected to a 3.5mm cable or via bluetooth. Both hacks are easy enough, but for $350 turning off power save should be a feature in the Sony app.

I got the Bose QC35 after these. The Bose are significantly lighter on my head, though still heavy. The difference in noise cancelling is obvious - Sony definitely wins here. The QC35s allow for noise cancellation only with no hacks and no power save.","Too expensive for what you get, but amazing noise cancellation"

These headphones provide serious noise cancellation and wonderful music reproduction. They are a bit on the snug side and having large ears I find the fit just about makes it inside the cups. Nonetheless the app that's free and included with the Headphones is very cleverly done and provides a significant amount of user input. The case needs a little work as positioning the phones within the case is a bit cumbersome and there isn't a dedicated pocket for the charging cable. You must rely on an outside the case netting which allows items to fall out. That aside I'd still purchase them as a solution for a full coverage wireless solution. BTW, pairing with my iPhone 7plus was seamless but as of yet have not been able to pair with my iPad's. I may have to unpaire with the phone in order to make that happen. Haven't tried that as of yetis primary usage is with my phone.",Almost perfect.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 23 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product fits well, connects well, sounds great, and effectively blocks ambient noise. Audiophiles will prefer the sound of these over the Bose Q35's, and if you're a fan of deep bass (like me), again, you'll prefer these. The downloadable app for the headphones includes a customizable equalizer (not just a list of available presets like in Apple's music settings), and includes the option to increase bass specifically. This is important to me because by increasing the bass through the headphones themselves, rather than through the equalizer in my spotify app, I get the increased bass while bypassing the degradation in audio that characterizes bluetooth streaming. The LDAC system/High-Res Audio is great. The sound is noticeably better than the Q35's. If you purchase the Q35's you might notice that they sound great (bass included, it's very impressive) over a WIRED connection. But when transitioning to a bluetooth connection (e.g. from my Mac to my iPhone) the bass completely falls apart. It actually sounds like they're broken. This won't be an issue if you don't artificially increase the bass like I do (with the EQ in the spotify app), but if you like bass you will be disappointed. Not with the Sony pair though. The bass is great, the streaming quality is certainly superior, and the battery is phenomenal. Though for $350 I recommend getting the warranty. I've not experienced any ""cracking"" referenced in some other reviews (I've also had them for less than a month), but it was enough to scare me into getting the warranty. Which, considering the price of the investment, is really not a bad idea anyways.

Overall, highly recommend.",Highly Recommend - Better Than Bose Q35's

3,Was this review helpful to you?, February 21 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's probably too early to write a review, after all I've only had this headphone set for less than 24 hours as I write this. But so far this Sony WH-1000XM2--an impersonal, heartless name if there ever was one--has been an impressive kit, at least after I actually figured out how the controls worked on this unit. So far I like the sonic qualities well enough for a closed design. I also like the comfort as I spent time with these on my day off, listening to a multitude of streamed music off of Amazon's Unlimited service, as well as my own digital files stored on my tablet and my phone.

It's lightweight enough to be comfortable throughout longer listening sessions. Even with my large ears the earpads envelope them and confirm that the design is truly an over-ear headphone set. The battery life is as promised and is still going strong well into its first charge. Its noise cancellation skill seems to be credible enough; though I'll need a noisier environment than my washing machine and vacuum cleaner to be certain (it may be my day off but chores are chores). The swipe controls (on the right earpiece housing) aren't the most intuitive to me at first and do seem quite sensitive, but I'm getting used to how it works. Fit and finish, as well as the build quality and materials are still too soon to judge, but so far they seem decent enough for something that costs $300 less tax(bought on sale here on Amazon). Comparing them to the QuietComfort 35 that I also was considering, this one hasn't left me wanting...so far.

This 'review' is for now more of a placeholder than a comprehensive go-over of the Sony, but at least for a day this Bluetooth headphone set has my attention. 4+ stars, for now.

Day 2: I've discovered that the XM2's noise cancelling ability is truly impressive. I've also discovered that wearing this headset to bed has its downfalls; rolling over onto my right side (a natural tendency I have), the right earcup ended up putting a fair amount of pressure on my head just above my ear. About four hours in I awoke with the headset still in place (something of a surprise since with other headphones I have a habit of losing or removing them off of my head during sleep), I had a pronounced sore spot at that area above my right ear, no doubt caused by the XM2 pressing against my skull for a good amount of that time. Hours later I still feel the irritation from wearing the Sony set during that sleep period. Disappointing but truthfully not totally unexpected.

I also have begun to garner a growing dislike for the touch controls on this headphone set. It's awfully easy for me to unintentionally or inadvertently sweep across that touch control surface and ""do something"" that didn't need to be done with the settings. That's an annoyance that I'll need to adjust myself to. Frankly having dedicated hardware controls would've mitigated this, but probably in Sony's design staff's view would've compromised the unit's exterior aesthetics, which I must admit is nicely clean and without clutter. But sometimes sacrifices need to be made and in this case of overly sensitive touch controls, this is one of those instances that clean, sparse aesthetics should have taken a back seat to functional parameters.

Battery life is indeed tremendous, but it's a downer that the headset can't be used wirelessly when the battery is charging. In fact when the unit is charging it's not particularly usable even when the included mini patch chord is used. There's a lot of electrical noise leakage when the XM2 is being charged, and it's enough to my ears to quell any desire to use the headset when the micro USB power chord is plugged in. I've also discovered some irritating sonic qualities to the Sony's sound signature and imaging soundstage. Some music really comes off as being rather murky sounding, muddled in the lack of detail and presence, while other types or specific songs are considerably less noticeable as such. It doesn't have me tossing aside the XM2 and reaching for one of my open-back headphones just yet, but it's still disappointing nonetheless.

Still calling it 4+ stars, but inching slowly downward.

Day 14: Yeah, I do LIKE this set of headphones. The noise cancelling is still excellent and better than I imagined it would ever be. The sound quality is very good given its closed dynamics. The SQ will never approach my preferred preference for open-back headphones and (to me) their superior, more 'natural' spatial qualities, but for what it is this XM2's sound continues to please me. I've figured out where to adjust the headband to in able to relieve most of the pressure this design places on the top of my ear, so even from a comfort standpoint it's becoming a non-event. The touch controls remain the only annoyance, but I AM adapting. I just think that it shouldn't have to be such a pain, especially since fingering and swiping the side of one's head is not exactly a natural thing for humans (well, most of us anyway).

Definitely 4+ stars.","Noise cancelling is awesome, music quality is so far pretty good."

Goosebumps continues...;) Throw some 24bits FLAC. Oh my.... The base. Middle. Highs. Fellas, mp3s won't do any justice to these cans. It all depends on your music. 24 bits have so much details. The base is another level. I've S8 with Exynos. So no aptX HD. But just put the Sony app and change mode to connection priority. Then fiddle with the EQ and see the difference. But put mode to quality priority if you want the best details. Unless you've latest snapdragon devices which natively support aptX HD, it doesn't matter. So I'd take the customization instead of aptX ( not 'aptx HD'). But if you've aptx HD capable device go ahead by all means. Again only for HQ audio. If your library is mp3 put it on connection priority and get the EQ adjustments. Enjoy fellas. Mind blowing. But for the ULTIMATE QUALITY you've to plug in the cable. Even LDAC can't equal wired quality. These cans + cable + S8 + 24bits FLAC = musical paradise. But who cares, we buy Bluetooth headphones for wireless freedom.
------------------
It's worth every penny. I used Bose QC25 before. Noise cancellation was very good. But audio quality was very unpleasant for me. Tried QC35 and Sony 1000x in a shop. Also tried Beoplay H9. With the Sony I got goosebumps!! It's night and day. Sony is way ahead on technology and quality.(Build quality of H9 is good. But sound was too artificial) Now this bad boy mark 2 is even better. Got a better deal in Amazon. Full software customization. Super comfortable. Feels absolutely premium. Aptx HD and LDAC. That's some serious tech. I was not a fan of Sony before. But this thing changed it. For audio quality, Bose is not even close. Don't this twice. The best noise cancelling headphones on the planet!!! Period. The Amazon box was little tampered. But product inside was intact. Unopened. So I'm Ok",Just buy it. Engineering at it's finest.

Mine kept deciding that I was walking while I was sitting at my desk or in crowded areas and would allow all of the outside noise into the headphones so I had trouble hearing calls or music. The people on the other end of the calls also had trouble understanding me because the background noise was transmitted to them as well.

Great buy and truly worth every penny.

The noise cancelling works great, auto adjusts and it not only shut out the noise of a plane engine but at least 2 crying children, which we all know is much louder than an engine. only cons are they controls sometimes don't respond well if you have big fingers the touch pad may sense where you don't want it to but it's a swipe motion so easily adjusted to.

I could enjoy using these, but I prefer the Bose QC35. With these Sony’s, my ears get hot and there is too much clamping pressure. Plus I don’t like the white noise at low volume. That being said - the noise cancelling at anything above low volume blows Bose out of the water. If you really need to tune out, these could be a great choice. These are significantly better than the Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones. I’ll stick with the Bose for now though.","Great sound, great noise cancelling"

Rich balanced sound - not bass-heavy like some other sets I've tried, much more balanced and comfortable sound levels. Very little difference overall from the MDR-7506 using mobile phone as source. Noise cancelling is superb. The NC Optimizer can be triggered with a press of a button and adjusts noise cancelling to your environment. Touch sensor on the right side is brilliant - easy control of music and phone calls. Love the Quick Attention feature, placing your hand over the touch panel quiets the music and pipes in ambient sound so you can quickly hear what's going on around you. Much more comfortable than my MDR-7506 - I can wear these for hours with no issues - very soft pads. Impressive build quality. Great that they can be used sans-power when connecting the cable.

The right side earbud has been producing some weird sound since last week. It's an expensive headphone for me and I have been using it carefully and it has been only one month after purchase. Therefore I immediately contacted Sony customer service via phone. After spending one hour telling two representatives all my information and what had been going on with the headphone, they arbitrarily, rudely concluded that it was broken artificially and refused to give any solutions. I asked that if they could check the headphone first before making conclusions because I was confident that it was defective. They just refused and insisted they would not offer any solutions. What's even more astounding is that they expired my warranty without any confirmation or evidence. They just made conjecture based on my words on the telephone, in which I repeated many times that I took good care of the headphone. I tried to contact SONY via their website. Their representatives just asked me to call the same number over and over again. I called many times. There were either no response or same answer and rejection of any detection. I just emailed them but I am so disappointed that I don't think they would make any instrumental effort to solve my problem. It has really been an awful experience and I plan to turn to law afterward. The headphone is not really a big deal but what SONY has done simply indicated that they don't respect their customer. And I will not be treated this way and just let go. They are just irresponsible and try everything to blame a customer to get away from the poor quality of their products. Never buy their products again!! Seriously!",DO NOT buy this! SONY is irresponsible and their customer service sucks!

The sound quality is definetly worth the price, and the ANC functuality definetly lives up to its name. Not to mention the touch controls on the right earcup, these are almost too good to be true. The only small issues I have are that there is slight overheating on my ears, and sadly another postponement for USB type C, but it’s not a big problem at all. The best part is the app, I have so much control over my music and how it sounds that I played around with it for hours until I was absolutely satisfied with the tone. Oh and for you sensitive ear people, these things pack a punch in bass, so u might want to turn it down in the settings. Although I payed $350 for mine, these very frequently go on sale for $300, so please wait until that happens and don’t rush into it like me lol. These headphones are really great for everyone and to all who are getting second choices about it, trust me when I say the price seems too fair for what you get; after all 30 hours of battery life seems like the money was well spent",The headphones are just amazing.

They block out all types of noises while also providing rich sounding audio. I've used these on the train and the amount of sound the noise canceling reduces is remarkable. One time on the train there was a woman playing the guitar literally across from me and I could just very faintly hear her with the noise canceling on and no music playing. Even my bus rides have been made so much more enjoyable just by wearing these headphones and being able to tune out the traffic just beyond my window.

In addition to the noise canceling, I like the fact that it can be turned off so you can let ambient sound in. Why you may ask? So when you're walking on a busy street or an intersection, you can still hear oncoming cars for safety purposes.

The fit is comfy and I like the foldable flat design. The touch controls are effective and I like being able to cup my hand over the right earcup if I need to speak to someone and don't want to take off my headphones. The battery life is excellent and they do well with all types of music from Jazz, to hip-hop, blues, vocals, you name it.

My only con is they can make my ears sweat after a prolonged period of time, so unfortunately I won't be wearing these during the summer. But I have earbuds for that, so I'm good. These ain't cheap but they're well worth the money.",Excellent Noise Canceling and Sound. Quality Headphones.

For a while now I've been a ""no wire, no fun"" headphone kind of guy, but I decided to try these. I've heard great things about Sony so I figured why not. And I'm never going back. The sound quality is excellent, I'd say better than alot of ""premium"" wired headphones and they are definitely leading the wireless headphones scene. Not only do they sound amazing, but they manage to retain this quality with VERY powerful noise cancelling AND Bluetooth. Also it comes with some very cool features like a touch sensitive ear cup. Just cool.

So what separates these from other headphones? Well in my experience they sound better, have insane noise cancelling magic, and are actually really comfy to wear. I recently went on about a 6 hour car ride and they were super comfy throughout the trip. Also, this battery lasts forever. I've never got the headphones to ""battery level: medium"" let alone the headphones dying.

Now of course nothing is perfect. The bass could be the tiniest bit punchier, but some eq settings fixed that quickly. More importantly though, the case is just silly. There is no room inside for anything than the headphones. The wires you might want to bring have a pocket on the outside of the case. Cmooonnnn. It's funny really that the worst part of the headphones are the cases. But again I won't detract from the headphones, they are spectacular, and if you need a different case, you can choose from a variety of third party options.

The sound is spectacular.

The noise cancelling is spectacular, and I like the ability to control it, by having an ambient sound control, and allowing some noise, (focus on voice) when necessary.

My comments for Sony:
1. Cmon drop this incredible inept headphone naming algorithm - the WH1000XM2, seriously??
2. Fix the sometimes-wonky song advance bug. No swiping, Swiper! It doesn't always work (why is this?). How about a real button for the fake swiping.
3. Keep the awesome NC but really, really fix the faccid sound. Do this. Compare the Beats to the M2's. Somehow the Beats lets you hear sounds and tones that the M2 cannot.

Was this review helpful to you?, January 15 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great noise cancelling headphones with a few wrinkles. Consider saving yourself $100+ and buy the refurbished MDR-1000X/B which are last year's version and almost identical. I've taken both the 1000XM2 and the 1000X/B on a flight and compared the them by swapping back and forth repeatedly; both using only noice cancellation, and while listening to music and movies while also using noise cancellation. The noise cancelling between them is almost identical, but not quite. XM2 seem to have the slightest edge over the old X/B, but I suspect it is because of the earpieces, not the technology. If you look at the photo I've included with this review, you'll see the XM2 headphones have smaller openings for your ears. If you have a large head or ears, this is definitely noticeable when you're wearing them. I suspect this smaller opening contributes to the ever so slightly better noise cancellation on the XM2. And it is really slight. However, because of this tighter opening for the ears, the XM2 will make your ears hotter than the X/B if you're wearing them for hours at a time (e.g. on long flights).

As for the sound quality, both the XM2 and the X/B sound good, not great. If sound quality is top priority over noise cancelling, then go with the B&W PX or any number of other wired passive headphones. Here again, the XM2's tighter earpieces were a downside for me. They cause the soundstage move further toward the back of head, instead of out front where you really want it to be. The X/B put the soundstage right in between my ears, which still isn't awesome, but it's SLIGHTLY better than the XM2. Neither model can compete with a pair of good open cup headphones like the Sennheiser HD650. But then you get absolutely no noise isolation, so pick your priority.

Other oddities...the XM2 has textured faux leather on the ear cups, the X/B has smooth. I prefer the smooth. The touch controls on the XM2 seem more prone to error (skipping tracks when you just meant to change the volume) than the X/B.

TL;DR Apparently I'm turning in a grumpy old man who doesn't like change. The MDR1000X/B were great--why, Sony, did you change them for this? And get off my lawn!

EDIT: The above review was written before I tired the companion app. The app has a soundstage control (""Sound Position Control"") that appears to be a crossfeed function. It fixes the ""back of your head"" soundstage problem I mentioned above. If you're reading this, Sony, please ditch the graphic EQ and adopt a parametric version where the user can just adjust the frequency response curve to their desired target. So much more useful than a graphic EQ.

Some other reviews mentioned the cracking issues on the MDR-1000X/B that I professed a fondness for. I haven't had any issues with mine, but others certainly have. Definitely take that into consideration. I also haven't had any issues with either headphones responding to pillows, seat cushions, hoods, or stocking caps. Capacitive controls shouldn't respond to pressure from everyday objects. That sounds like a defective headphone.","Great noise cancelling headphones, but consider saving $100+ by buying the refurbished MDR-1000X/B"

I have hearing loss such that we can't find a volume that doesn't blast her out in order for me to hear. Even then, I struggle with speech clarity. I have then connected to two unused channels from my Denon 3300 AVR through an Avantree Priva III bluetooth adapter with APTX LL. I was concerned that the Sony WH1000 that although they have APTX they don't support low latency, but when I tried this combination dialog matching between picture and sound is very close and not a hindrance at all.

When I tested these haedphones at Best Buy I was standing next to a young mother with two toddlers that were anything but quiet at the time. Shut them out completely. At home, exterior noises are just about non-existant so this ANR is fantastic. The controls are easy and the headphones paired with the adapter right away on first try. They reconnect easily when I turn them on.

I have experienced a desire for a little more volume as many others reviews have pointed out but not enough to lower my rating. I am also concerned with the reports of cracking and so I am extra careful when handling the headphones The carrying case is not built very strong but I don't use them in that way.

noise cancelling is great, adaptive settings seem to really help different environments
comfortable ear cups, easily fit over ear, I can wear for hours. Easy to put on without missing ear lobes or hair.
touch controls are great after a bit of getting used to. Pass through audio is super effective.

The Ok:
GSM interference whilst connected via bluetooth is a bit ""retro"" If phone is near face, it's quiet loud

The Bad:
Case, albeit tidy, cannot store USB or 3.5mm jack cable, but does have storage for flight adapter?!?! which is, of course, useless without jack cable.

Sound Quality: Based on reviews these were shown to have slightly better sound quality than the bose 35. Also, when the sony headphones are completely out of battery you can still use them as headphones without a distortion of sound quality while the bose 35 headphone sound deteriorates.

Battery Life: Sony's headphones have ~30 hours of battery life per charge while the bose 35 only last for 20 hours.

Features: The Sony headphones have more features. I particularly like the Sony headphones ability to pause sound in the headphones by cupping the right ear so you can speak to someone normally without needing to take off the headphones.

There is still the typical Bluetooth sound signature. Don't get me wrong though, they sound excellent for Bluetooth headphones. Vocal bass is a bit weak, but instrumental bass is great. Mid-tones are good and have enough detail. Treble frequencies are very good. I find that to get the best sound, I have to put my iPhone equalizer on the treble boost setting, and as well, I have to put the Sony Connect app on it's treble boost setting also. Otherwise without these settings, the headphones sound muffled.

I find that I can have long listening sessions with these headphones without any temporary hearing loss or ear fatigue. I can not say this for all headphone I have used, so this is a positive.

The Sony mobile app has several features including a manual equalizer that works pretty well. The app has a surround feature to change the position of vocals. I don't know why anyone would want to use this feature, since it distorts already good sounding audio. The ambient sound auto-adjust feature can be turned on and off in the app. It is disabled by default.

The product is nicely manufactured and the headband does have enough pleather coated padding. I have not felt any discomfort wearing the headphones. I did not find the touchpad difficult to use; it works great. Noise cancelation is unusually good and I think this is the headphones strength. I feel that I made a good purchase. These do not sound as good as the Bowers and Wilkins P7wireless, but the ability to have very good active noise cancelation makes them a good buy.

The headphones would no longer turn on, and it turns out that this is an incredibly common problem that Sony doesn't like to admit to or properly deal with.

Sony has never been very good about dealing with defective products. They are very difficult to get ahold of to begin with, and they try to deny your warranty claim any chance they get.

Beyond the many problems with the headphones, the sound leaves a lot to be desired. They have good highs and half decent lows, but the mids are absolutely non-existent.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 23 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I've only had these for a few days so these are my initial impressions. (I keep updating this review as I continue to use the headphones)

I've also bought the Sennheiser PXC 550 Wireless. The Sony ANC is *much* better than the PXC.

I found the PXC earmuffs got my ears very hot even in a room less than 70º F. I can't possibly imagine using them in the summer. The room I'm is 69º F. The headphones, and my ears, are 90º F. My ears are red.

ANC: I turned on a battery driven vacuum cleaner which is *extremely* loud. I normally wear commercial grade hearing protection when working with loud equipment. I tried on the Sony ANC and the noise dropped massively. The commercial grade hearing protection let in a lot more noise. But make no mistake, no ANC is going to magically remove all noise.

Switching between the Mac and iPhone is a massive pain. I don't think Sony could have made switching more difficult. Probably easier to have two sets of headphones because if you're using the headphones on the Mac and the iPhone rings, you will never, ever be able to switch before the calling party hangs up.

I find the Sony headset controls to be confusing. The PXC were easier to use.

Connecting to Siri on my iPhone X is completely hit-or-miss. The directions are all over the place. Double tap for 0.4 seconds (seriously?) and other directions state to press and hold. I would like to make a phone call from the Sony without having to get the iPhone out but I haven't found the magical press or tap or double tap to invoke Siri and say ""Hey Siri, call Pizza"". Update: Reading a different portion of the manual, I found that tapping the headphone will activate Siri.

I found this portion of the manual confusing:

""Make a request to Siri through the headset’s microphone.
When the iPhone is in standby or playing music, hold your finger to the touch sensor control panel to activate Siri.
Siri is activated and you will hear the start-up sound.""

....then several lines down....

""Siri cannot be activated when you say “Hey Siri” through the headset’s microphone even when the iPhone’s [Allow “Hey Siri”] setting is on.""

Can someone explain the apparent contradiction in instructions above or am I really dense?

Contrary to what the negative comments regarding the microphone, I found the Sony microphone to be clear (at least according to the person I was speaking to).

I'm not an audiophile but I found the sound quality to be very, very good in Bluetooth mode.

The Sony app annoys me. Why does Sony need to know my exact location at all times (even when running in the background) to work properly. How does it matter if I'm 5th or 6th avenue? The 'Privacy' EULA is over the top.

I have had the headphones on for about 30 minutes and my ears are very, very warm. There's not a chance I could use the Sony over the ears headphones in a warm (let alone hot) environment. These would be great for keeping your ears warm in the winter.

While I'm not thrilled with Bose, I'm going to a store to compare the Sony against the QC35 II for ANC and far more importantly, ear comfort.
If the headphones are very uncomfortable (hot and sweaty), I'm not going to use the headphone regardless of how great they sound.

Ugghh. My ears are burning up in the time I've written this review -- I've got to take them off.

If you're the type of person who tends to have cold ears, then these may be perfect you (if you can figure out the controls).

I'm probably going to keep these for a niche use: I spend a lot of time in waiting rooms where the TV is blaring putting a hole through my head. Yes, I could use high-quality noise ear plugs to virtually eliminate the noise but I want to listen to something. So for the 30-90 minutes I have to wait, I can tune out the mindless screeching from the TV and calmly listen to music from my phone.",Good (great?) sound quality and noise reduction. Hot and sweaty ears. Can't use them in warm environments.

As they are at the same price point, I expected this to be the same or better. It's not:
1) They are not nearly as comfortable. They fit quite tightly whereas the bose fits like a pillow. My wife has to take her earrings off every time she uses these, while she can keep them on with the Bose QC35. I can wear the Bose for 4-5 hours straight - have to take the sony's off after a while.
2) Pairing multiple devices is a breeze with the bose, it's a pain in the rear with the Sony.
3) Sound quality is not on par. Sound is flatter than the Bose. Yes there is an app and an EQ for your phone, but see #4.
4) For $50 I'd like to toy with headphones. At almost $400, I want the damn things to be studio quality. I don't want an app with 5 different customisation settings. It's almost as if all the ""features"" are there to make up for lack of sound fullness.

Was this review helpful to you?, February 15 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So this was my third attempt at finding a pair of wireless over-ear headphones. My previous two were a cheaper set of Sonys and the Bowers & Wilkins PX. For various reasons, those did not work out, which led me to these. This will be the quickest I've ever returned a set of headphones. I had 4 main issues with these:

1. They did not fit on my head. Even on the tightest setting, they were too loose on my head. If I look up, they'd slide off backwards. If I look down, they'd slide off forwards. If I look left and right they slowly slide down my ears. Funny enough, I always thought I had a slightly larger than average head size, but apparently my head is not big enough to keep these headphones on them, even on the snuggest setting. This was massively disappointing as I did not see any other reviewers mention this.

2. The ear cup size is actually too small for my ears. These headphones are making me paranoid: am I a small headed, big eared freak? Seriously, the opening in each ear cup is too small to fit my ears, regardless of how much I shift them around. This made them ultimately feel like they're somewhere between on ear headphones and over ear headphones. Maybe they should brand them as Mostly Over Ear? It's uncomfortable not having your ears fit inside the cups.

3. Sound leakage. Good god these are awful in this category. It's embarrassing trying to ride the train and knowing that everyone around you can hear exactly what you're listening to. If you like to listen to music loudly, you may as well carry a boom box around because your neighbors within about 12 feet will hear everything you're listening to.

4. Swipe controls. This is the smallest complaint, and the only one that wouldn't be a deal breaker for me if it were the only issue I had with these. They're way too sensitive and I couldn't find a way to turn them off. The slightest adjustment I was trying to make to the ear cups, which happened often since they wouldn't stay on my head, would accidentally trigger the volume lowering or the song skipping or something. I'm sure with enough time I would perfect the art of tip-toe-ing around accidentally triggering the controls when adjusting the fit, but I will not own them long enough for that to happen.

So I guess I'll mention what these headphones do good: sound quality and noise cancellation. They are great at both of these things. So I guess if you're a big headed, small eared person who doesn't care that your neighbors can hear everything you're listening to, or maybe you just listen at home when no one else is around, or maybe you're just inconsiderate and don't care that everyone can hear your music, then feel free to buy these headphones. As for me, the quest to find a solid pair of wireless headphones continues.",You'll need a big head and small ears to comfortably wear these. Also: zero regard for your neighbors as the sound leak is awful

Extremely impressive cans. The app is also very well done. I often work from a well known coffee chain for a few hours at a time, and it's amazing how much of the ambient noise these reduce. I really like the color, although it's not gold but more of a light bronze. Unlike some reviewers, I have no discomfort wearing for 8 hours a day, they fit nicely over my ears -- I have no hair, and don't extend the band, so maybe that's why they fit well.

One tip is that unless you use the app, you may be disappointed by the default EQ settings. I listen to mostly chillout, minimal, progressive, and other electronic instrumental music, and out of the box the bass was weaker than expected. BUT the app lets you create custom EQ settings, which allowed me to perfectly EQ for what I prefer. I'm really picky and the app satisfied my needs.

When you start playing music, you can hear only louder noises, like car horns, generators, and PA announcements. Even these sounds are dull and reduced a lot.The sound quality in these is stellar. There is no focus on either bass or treble; they are generally more balanced. You can control this in the app that you should definitely download and then get tinkering with the equalizer. The headphones are great for the flier since they can help reduce or increase the pressure, controlled through the app. The battery life is so good.

Headphones considered: Bowers and Wilkins PX and Sennheiser PXC 550. No...I didn't even consider the Bose QC 35 2. Demoed it in the store and thought the bass was way too heavy and too similar sounding to the Beats Studio 2.0. I loved my Beats and they served their purpose well but technology changes rapidly and I wanted something with BT capabilities.

Sound is phenomenal! Crisp highs and mids without boomy, over exaggerated bass. I like my share of bass but not to a point where it takes over. I truly enjoy listening to my music in the 1000XM2! Sound is different when wireless, using a cable and with ANC on. Although different, the sound is still great in any mode. Personally, I prefer wireless with ANC on. I haven't found a need to mess with any of the setting in the app much but will explore those settings as well.

ANC is MUCH better than my previous travel and work headphones. Outside sound is muted and I feel like I'm in my own world. With my previous headphones I could still hear outside noises just not clearly. Music sounds great with ANC on or off but I do find it to be a bit different.

Comfort is EXCELLENT! Very lightweight, soft ear pads and not tight on my head/ears. I have not noticed any heat issues but have only worn them for 2 hours at a time so far. The absolute most comfortable of any of the headphones that I was able to try on or any that I currently own (V-Moda LP2 with XL ear pads, Beats Studio 2.0, JBL Synchros S700, and Logitech UE 6000)

Features are far beyond what I as using. Very easy to lear and use. The touch controls are a game changer in the headphone market! The form factor when folded and in the case is small and compact.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase. I ordered and demoed the Bowers and Wilkins PX also but they are going back. GREAT sound but the Sony WH1000XM2 is far more comfortable and I prefer the touch controls.

Have Beats wired Studio noise canceling head phones, bought the Bose Q35 and compared to the Sony WH1000XM2. Also have Bose Wireless Sport headphones, Seinser wired ear buds, Bose wired sport buds, AKG buds I got with my S8 and I-Phone buds I got with my IPhone 6.

Sound Quality is subjective and very personal, my preference is the Sony's over all the headphones I currently have, non noise canceling and noise canceling.

Direct comparison to the Beats, Bose, the sound quality is preferred on the Sony as mentioned above, noise canceling very, very slight edge to the Sony, Bose and Sony are both well ahead of the Beats I own (4 year old model). Features, hands down the Sony absolutely blows away anything I've seen on the market. The App allows you to customize the noise canceling in useful, meaningful ways, has a customizable equalizer that allows you to personalize the sound in a meaningful way. The app also has surround sound settings that are gimmicky, didn't seem to do anything but take away from the sound quality. Being able to cup the right ear to turn off the head phones and hear someone is really great feature, being able to customize the noise canceling to filter out or allow voices and if you like automatically adjust based on your movement pretty cool.

On calls - I've read professional and personal reviews that all say phone calls are better on the Bose, I tested both, the Sony performed better for me, I was able to hear myself more clearly, others heard me more clearly on the Sony. The Sony's did pick up more ambient noise that was passed on to the caller on the other line.

Bluetooth connectivity is better than any Bluetooth headphones I have owned prior in regards to sound quality. Having no wires while traveling, getting on and off planes, wow, never realized what I was missing.

Comfort - Bose win out here - they are more comfortable, they cover the entire hear, create less heat around your ears and less pressure on your head, ears, face and jaw. Sony's aren't bad from a comfort standpoint but Bose is a level above any other over the ear headphones I've tried.

Overall I would say you have to try the various headphones on the market as so much of what you will or won't like about a particular pair is subjective. For me, the sound quality, the features and noise canceling won the day for me. Bose fell flat on a sound quality and feature standpoint, I actually preferred my Beats to the Bose on sound quality. The sacrifice is on the comfort front, no one beats Bose. If you are looking for noise canceling and that's a key feature, as other reviews have said, Sony and Bose are the best. If overall sound quality trumps all else, there are a couple headphones on the market that perform better on sound quality but aren't in the same ballpark from a noise canceling standpoint. Generally wired and non noise canceling sound better. The Sony's seem to strike the best compromise for me on delivering everything I want in my noise canceling headphones that are primarily for travel.",Best Noise Canceling Headphones I've tried

First of all I want to say that the shipping method was the best I’ve ever tried.
I’ve bought the headphones on Tuesday in the US and I’ve received the next Thursday in Sicily (IT)!
This is unbelievable and amazing!

First impression

The packaging is so beautiful, in particular the inside box.
The headphones have a simple appearance, I mean not so flashy, I like it! You can use them also to go at work and if you are not so young you don’t look like a freak!
The material are very good looking and I think also resistant. The pads are very soft and able to deaden the noise also when the headphone are turned off.
The sound is very clean and can be very loud. The control on the right pad is very précising and the “ambient trick” is very helpful and intuitive to use it.
The app gives you some features very interesting.

Noise cancellation: Sony WH1000XM2 wins. The difference is subtle at first, until you get to use Sony for at a few hours.

Comfort: QC15 wins hands down. I can tolerate Sony headset, but it is pretty uncomfortable (and hot). QC15 is pleasure to wear.

Sound quality: QC15 wins here. Sony has a bit better bass, but anything above else just sucks, plus that hiss... Which is very unfortunate.

(nitpick) Naming: I understand ""QC15"" ""QC25""... etc, but wtf is ""WH1000XM2"", sony?

Was this review helpful to you?, February 9 2018,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I narrowed down my hunt to upgrade my exercise music experience to three higher end headphones and couldn't narrow it further so decided to get all three to find out in side by side comparisons which would be the best for me.

[1] Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling ($349.00)

[2] Beats Studio3 Wireless Headphones ($298.99)

[3] Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth ($348.00)

I put on the Beats and the heaviness and fit gave me the sense of an impending headache the instant I put them on. That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.

I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.

I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows. I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close. The final point that won out for Bose was they were so much lighter and better fitting.

In addition to all of the above, as I've continued to use the Bose for 'everything' - I was most surprised when on a whim I decided to see if I could place a call with them; and my two initial callers both exlaimed that this was the BEST and clearest sound talking to me they had yet experienced (For years I've tried their patience through testing calls with 10-15 different best rated wired and wireless headpeices, ear buds et al). The rave reviews of the recipients of my calls carried from inside to outside walking the streets of NYC with all the usual sirens and traffic noise.

But most important of all, I can listen to my music in full head-filling gorgeous energizing glory when I'm exercising.","Very good full bodied sound, just slightly bigger and heavier than I wanted"
8,3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 11 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality: Pretty good but not great. The WH1000XM2’s have quite a lot of coloration especially in the low to mid frequency range. At first it sounds punchy and full, but over time my ears became fatigued. The Bose QC35’s have a flatter frequency response that is very similar to my AKG K240’s. In fact the EQ settings I normally use for K240’s work with just some very slight tweeking for the QC35’s, but for the WH1000XM2’s I had to use completely different settings. But in the end the Sony’s just didn’t have good clarity and stereo seperation compared with the Bose.

Comfort: At first, the Sony’s seemed on par with the Bose, but after a while the headband started to hurt me on top of my head, and I found myself constantly adjusting them, and everytime I touched them I inadvertently caused the music to pause or rewind. I can wear the bose for hours on end and hardly feel them at all.

Battery Life: I haven’t had them long enough to comment on this, but others claim they can go days without being charged, and this is believable because the Bose can do that too.

Touch Controls: I hate it. Needs dedicated buttons so you don’t inadvertently pause or skip to the next song, but all you really wanted was to adjust them on your head.

Bluetooth (pairing): Out of four different devices, I only successfully paired them to one. They paired to my Galaxy S7 but would not pair to my ipad pro. I also failed to pair them with another galaxy phone and an Amazon Fire tablet. None of the devices could see the headphones on a normal bluetooth scan. The galaxy S7 was only able to pair when I switched on the near field (NFC) function. The Bose QC-35’s have a manual pairing function that makes pairing painless.

Bluetooth Range: Very good.

Noise Canceling: Very good. Just as good as the Bose as far as I can tell.

With a little work these phones could be as good (or better) than the Bose, but right now it’s just hype. I’m sending these back btw because of the pairing issue.",Pretty Good but NOT Better than Bose QC-35’s
9,23 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 26 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headphone, however I returned it for two of the reasons below:
1. This device will shut down after 5 minutes of unused. Meaning that if you do not connect to any bluetooth device, this headphone will automatically shut down after 5 minutes. Why on earth would a Noise Canceling device have this feature without an option to turn it off? Who thinks it's a good idea to have this feature from the beginning? Even if you are connected to a device, it'll shut down if it's inactive for 5 minutes. So unless you are planning on listening to music 14 hours straight for your flight, then don't get this headphone. Why am I force to listen to music 14 hours straight just to use the ANC feature? Why can't I have quiet time? This is the reason why I bought this from the beginning.

2. The touch feature is nice on the right ear, however, anything can and will trigger this touch function. Let say you're laying down on the side, the pillow or chair will touch the right ear cup and will let ambient noises in. Seriously? we can unlock our phone using fingerprint and faces, yet Sony's Engineers can't create a touch function that will only register touch from fingers only?","Be AWARE of the Powersaver ""feature"""

0,3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, December 26 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, aesthetics, battery life, etc. but a couple issues in execution that prevent 4 or 5 stars.

USB Micro? Come on gang. Every time you release a product using legacy standards you have a chilling effect on adopting newer hotness. Used to not think the USB-C thing was a significant improvement, but its very nice not having to flip and fumble for that connection. Provide a cable for both USB-C to USB-C as well as a USB-A to USB-C; Since we're just using them for charging at standard USB rates, it doesn't have to be anything more than USB 2 or what-not. Literally no downside to USB-C for this kind of implementation. Or, better yet, QI maybe? Mmmmm... wireless charging... it's almost like someone willing to pay a couple hundred for premium wireless cans might be interested in wireless charging too... But for the love of all that is holy, don't use a proprietary connector (or inductive charging) like jaybird.

While we're talking about wireless and connectivity, what’s the deal with pushing the whole NFC connect? I love the forward-thinking interface, but the use-case is so small, and implementation so trouble ridden, it seems like it’s not adding any value. Yeah, conceptually it would be nice to use this instead of opening the Bluetooth connection options, but I'm usually switching between work-laptop, phone, and personal-laptop; while my phone has NFC, neither of the laptops have it, so that's kind of useless for 2/3s of my gear. Also, most people I know don't understand NFC, let alone bother enabling it on the devices that support it (my android stuff seems to default to NFC off; security risk maybe?). I suppose if they hardened the spec and everyone started using NFC for tap-to-pay then acceptance would pick up and more devices would have it, but considering Sony spun off their computers and their tablets don't even list NFC on their specs, it feels like a misguided feature that should have had the kids in marketing spend their UX thought elsewhere, like on the buttonless touch controls…

The capacitive stroking for volume and track changing is a neat trick and probably the right choice with regards to tech for physical control of the unit, but its unreliability and telegraphing make it a nuisance rather than an asset. Gotta reach up, place my hand around the can to reliably stroke the correct motion; it can take several strokes to get the motion right. Maybe put tactile guides for the finger to follow to increase reliability/consistency in motions, or, you know, maybe just a capacitive contact plate that I can feel and hold my finger on to send the same sort of signal. Less telegraphing of the finger and more consistency in sending the command (also looks less goofy than gently petting your headphones constantly).

Use similar contact plates for power-on and noise-cancel on/off settings. The current traditional buttons are too small to find easily and feel jankey when you push. Contact plates instead of a large stroke field seems like a win-win.

Finally! Connecting or powering-on the headphones causes the noise-cancelling (NC) to turn on. Considering that noise is usually not an issue and I value battery life over the NC, this is a genuine nuisance. I've already talked about the capacitive controls on the headphones increasing the complexity of interacting with the device, but continually reversing a setting I've enabled and turning on the NC every time I power-on or connect is NOT a value-add. I'm hoping there is a setting in the phone app that will allow me to disable NC on-at-connect or something (not going to hold my breath though).

Bottom line: My MDR-1RBTMK2's are more comfortable and have a more youthful aesthetic while these WH1000XM2's have a better sound stage, stay cooler on my head after hours of listening.

I think my MDR-1RBTMRK2's are still the cans to beat for wireless fidelity, battery-life and comfort but the WH1000XM2's are not bad by any means. Will keep one pair at home and one pair at work.

How they stack up against my other headphones:
- Grado 325 (best sound; literally painful to wear for long sessions; wired)
- Oppo PM3 (great++ sound that doesn't inflict 4d12 bludgeoning damage after 1d4 hours listening; wired)
- Sony MDR-1RBTMRK2 (great sound; great battery; comfort; wireless convenience is awesome)
- Sony WH1000XM2 (great+ sound; great battery; comfort+; wireless convenience is awesome; good noise cancelling; user interface struggles.)
- Audio-Technica ATH-A900X (great sound; heavy; poor aesthetics; wired)
- Jaybird x-3 (fair sound; good battery; super portable; fit can be tricky; proprietary charger is schwag)
- Jaybird x-2 (fair+ sound; fair battery; super portable; fit can be tricky; unreliable; break frequently; great while they last)
- Sony MDRV6 (good sound; sturdy; crazy-good value)
- Various other Jaybird products (freedom, bluebuds, JB-200) (passable sound, fragile, poor range, etc., use the x lineup)
- Sennheiser MM 400-X (passable sound, pathetic battery; worthless noise canceling; fragile; expensive; uncomfortable; The only headphones besides Apple's old ipod earbuds I've ever had an antagonistic relationship with; Only positive attribute is the built-in audio pass-through; I keep them just to remind me of why I love everything else)","Great sound, aesthetics"

Was this review helpful to you?, September 26 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"one of my first reviews ever, so: Look it's a decent bit of kit but it does definitely have some drawbacks, i'll try and stick to pro's and cons. For reference I traded in my PXC 550's for this, I don't mind my PXC 550's but they where just a bit too quiet.

Pros:
- Noise cancelling and the hand over the headphone to hear others is great, I wish it would respond just a tiny bit faster, but otherwise good
- The sound signature/profile is pretty good, i have my doubts if they have any more clarity than say the PXC 550's, but the sound signature is way more my style (think more bass, flatter dynamics I would say but in this day and age of ultra compressed music it's not too noticeable, no high-pitched tinnyness)
- WAY more comfortable than the pxc 550's, especially for those of you like me with dumbo ears.
- excellent battery life, lasts forever, but...

Cons:
- The worst by far is this: Wifi is turned off when you plug it in for charging, COME ON SONY! How hard can it be to fix that? This is why i removed two stars, this is just unacceptable in this day and age, how bloody hard could it possibly be???
- When you turn up the volume or indeed do any sort of action, the noises to indicate for example you have reached max volume are way too long, there is no need for it to take up that much space to just tell me ive hit max volume, shorten this down.
- i occasionally get odd ear pains that I think have something to do with the noise cancellation, i didn't ever get this with the PXC 550's (to be fair, this may be due to the pxc 550's never forming a true seal around my ears since the pads on the pxc 550 where too small for my envy-of-elephants ears)",Good headphones with one major drawback PLEASE FIX SONY either via firmware or allow us to trade in

Features: the swipe motions are amazing seemed kinda like a gimmick but fell in immediately after using them.
Sound Quality: is amazing, I'm no audiophile but I have pretty high standards for $350 and these do not disappoint. I love the sound profile of these plenty of bass, beautiful mids and most importantly the highs didn't give me listening fatigue, which I get very easily. These are actually the first headphone that sound so good I don't want to sing with the music because I want to hear the sound in all its glory.
Noise cancelling: the true negative of these headphones. The noise cancelling is underwhelming to say the least. Maybe there is no thing as headphone that completely cancel noise but for noise cancelling to be in the title, they don't cancel really anything. At best they muffle sound which is more annoying because it still distracts me.
Overall: great headphones with bad noise cancelling(muffeling) if noise cancelling is what you really want I'd get the bose qc35, which is what I might do.","Great sound quality, meh noise cancelling"

-Great app that accompanies these headphones. --Can adjust noise cancelling sensitivity and the equalizer easily.
-Very comfortable
-Good sound quality

The bad:
-headphones crackle on takeoff in airplane
-headphones pickup noise from air vents above you on an airplane
-microphone has no noise cancelling for phone calls
-leaning up against the window on an airplane will activate 'voice control' which is not possible to turn off on iPhones. Terrible disruption while trying to sleep with the headphones on.

I have been flying with the headphones for the past month and will be returning these headphones and trying a different brand due to the bad outweighing the good.

I also own bose QC 25 and the 30
But considering that these the most expensive ANC BT option at the moment, they really aren’t worth the cost. Here is the problems:

- Touch control on the earcups are a gimmick and they are not practical. If you wear a hoodie or a coat with a hood you will have trouble using the earphones.

- most of the features of the app ar gimmicky - like the one that never works that should keep track of your position with the gps and change settings, it’s neevr accurate and just a mess. Or the altitude detection, what is that supposed to do? Or the silly haadx which is supposed to add frequencies to an mp3 to make it sound like a wave file... silly gimmicks.

- noise isolation is not as good as the bose QC. Part of the reason is that the earcups cannot seal at all if you have glasses

- when anc is on and you are not listening to anything, there is constant hiss. Bose don’t have this. It’s unacceptable!!

- there is a cracking noise coming randomly during playback, I had to make sure this was indeed from the headphones. I’m not sure if it’s because the headband is vibrating when the volume is high, as this headset is very prone to amplify physical vibrations and create artifact sounds out of it with the ANC chip

- sound is not very balanced, lack in the definition of bass and the bass is overall too present for acoustic music. I could live with that if the rest was on point, but those are not an audiophile earphones by any extent.

My bose broke twice in a row, their quality is not great either, so I wanted to find an alternative but Sony is not it. About to return them after 15 days of extended testing. Will get the bose again with a warranty since the QC35 break very easily but overall they have better reliability and sound.","Sound quality suboptimal, lots of other small problems"

I have sensitive hearing and the distortion makes it unenjoyable to use in instances in which I have to turn the volume up high like when I am mowing the lawn.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 3 2017,Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, and currently have one good headphones (AKG K701) that are not really portable and I use them mostly when working from home (sound leakage, open design). I am looking for polyvalent wireless headphones, mostly to listen while working 8h / day. Tried the Skullcandy Hesh 3 Wireless Headphone, Black (S6HTW-K033), the Sennheiser HD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones (HD 4.40 BT), the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Case - Gold and the Bose QC35II. Did compare them on various musics, rock, pop, classic, ... .

Bottom line: The only one I kept are the Hesh 3! Not for myself as I felt the comfort was not great (too tight / clamping pressure, burning ears after 1h listening), but for commute / smaller listening periods (i.e not full workday), they are great. Bluetooth is stable, sound quality is good. I'll keep looking for a comfy work-polyvalent headphones, probably give up the bluetooth criteria as I'm disappointed by the sound quality of the Sony & the Bose, and I'm not ready to put 350$ for 100$ audio quality level.

Sound quality:
Sony and the Bose are OK, but that's it, just OK, not great and not what I expect from 350$ headphones.
Hesh3 have well defined bass (not too boomy, just what's needed to make it a fun headphones to listen to). Very good spatialization. Grabbed them at 80$ on black friday, and for my uneducated ears, they compare more to the Sony & the Bose than with my AKG K701 (not in the same category :-)). TBH, the sony & bose are a bit more clear than the Hesh3, but ... I feel the Hesh3 are more ""fun"" and would be my choice here.
The clear looser here are the Sennheiser. They are disqualified from this review. Stay away from them, my 10y-old 15$ Koss are better. No spatialization, bad for rock, for pop, for classic... Might do for techno / podcasts.

Build / comfort:
Hesh 3 feels a bit plastic like at opening, but you quickly forget it. Comfort is so-so, you definitely feel them more than Sony & Bose. More clamping pressure, lower quality ear pads.
Sony feels good and are probably the winner, I'm just a bit worried about the touch control thingy, what happens after the warranty expires ? Do you pay 200$ for repair if this stop working or bug ?
Bose earpads feel less durable, BUT, they are the comfort winner. If you have money and want to buy a light, comfy headphones, go for it. Sony are the 2nd best in these models.

Bluetooth:
Hesh3: all good.
Sony: I sent them back because... they kept jumping on my macbook. If I looked left or right, the sound will jump. If I walk 2 meter away from the laptop, it will jump. Worked good with my iPhone, but ... it's the only BT headphones I tried that was disqualified because of this. Not acceptable for this price range.
Bose: did try them only 30min, but they seemed good.

Sound leakage / isolation:
Hesh3: no active noise cancellation, but cost 5 time less than the competition. I don't need that much noise cancellation and what they provide is enough to work in a open space, very little sound leakage.
Sony / Bose: amazing. You put them on, and feel isolated from a lot of background noise. If you're looking for peaceful commute, they are worth it. The mic from the Sony did seems to pick less background noise in the few calls I tried.","Tried few Bluetooth headphones, the only one I kept are the Skullcandy Hesh 3"

Despite the very annoying bug below, where headphones shut off every 5 minutes (unless you have an active connection)
the noise cancellation is amazing. Much better than Bose qc35. I tested both, and Sony has much better
You have to experience the noise cancellation on these to really understand how good it is. Go from a noisy background to tranquility when you put them on. The best on the market, but let down by the bug (see below), and poor quality app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headphones automatically shut off every 5 minutes. So can’t easily be used just for noise cancelling

There are 2 work arounds for this
1) Have it connected via blue tooth to a cell. (not practical as you need to dedicate a cell phone , with a blue tooth connection to each head set)
2) Plug in a dummy wireless jack and have a dangling cord (this is not practical when you are using the headphones in bed, to help you sleep)

This is such a stupid feature, that could so easily have been fixed
It is a deal breaker, if you just want a pair of headphones for noise cancelling.

So, I am going to give it 1 out of 5 as a protest.
Sorry Sony, but these headphones are sold as ""the best noise cancelling headphones on the market""

I listened both, side-to-side, for eight hours. This is what I found.

Sound quality:
Sony: Very bassey, almost too much on some songs. I believe this is because of the Hifi setting in the app for high definition songs. The nicest thing as far as musically, the music sounds more lyrical. Now keep in mind, I’m coming from regular Apple headphones. However, being a musician — there was a certain musicality to the Sonys.

Bose: The Bose was very balanced, unfortunately too much where everything sounded generic. It was well kept within a neutral line, and never dipped below or above it. It kind ruined the music of some pieces.

Comfort. Both legitimately were comfortable. They fit both of my ears fine.

The biggest thing beside the sound being better, I actually like the “gimmicks”, of the app and the head piece. It made the headphones a little bit more tech, and less just a headphones.

So if you’re on the fence, pick these up.

Unless you’re more attuned to higher trebles in singing, and neutral sounds, then get the Bose. However if you want the headphones to have lyrical sounds, then the Sony.

You’ll enjoy them.",I bought the Bose QC35’s and the Sony’s... I kept the Sony.

I’m a novice audiophile coming from using open air Grados for years. Noise reduction in flight is remarkable - even without music, cabin racket turns into a faint, white noise. More quiet than even wearing ear plugs - it’s kind of surreal. I always used buds for music on planes, which got me by, to a point I could hear the music. But with these it is possible to appreciate subtleties of what’s playing. Even in a quiet office setting, it’s amazing how much background drone these can cut out, which really brings the music out. Battery life is great as well. Sony claims 20ish hours - I have surpassed that by a few hours on every charge so far. In a very quiet setting, I’ll still give the sound quality to any set of Grados.

Coming in knowing it won’t get rid of a lot of the voices, I was rather surprised it drowned it out quite well, to be degree of voices of people talking loudly a desk away from me sounds distant. It amazed me how putting the headphones on, the noise of the aircon literally disappeared, couldn’t help but whisper “wow...” under my breath.

With noise cancelling on, I have music gently pumping away to just further get rid of whatever higher frequency noises the headphones forgivabley let slip by, and it’s blissful.

Fast charging is ridiculously fast on this thing and it typically lasts me up to a week of use at work for a 9-5 job where I will probably use it for 2-3 hours total throughout the work day, and another hour or two at home, music playing from my iPhone.

Clarity of audio is decent, don’t expect pumping heavy, brassy audio from these, as they’re not meant for audiophiles, however, they still manage to pack a punch, and the EQ settings from the official app allows for some finer tuning to your liking (I sometimes use the extra bass preset, works well).

Comfort wise, after an hour of use, I do find it a bit uncomfortable on my ears, mainly because my ears stick out very slightly, but it’s not as bad as other headphones I’ve tried. No pressure find on top of my head.

Bluetooth is strong and works at quite a decent distance.

The noise cancelling is ridiculous as I remember back in the 90's when noise cancelling had a buzz in the background. With these there's just a beep and suddenly everything goes quiet. It's pretty unnerving the first few times you do it, but having the option for ambient sound is amazing when walking through the city. The quick attention mode is great too to catch announcements on intercoms and such.

There are some annoying things about the headphone, but they are definitely not Sony's fault and more Android's fault. Android 8.0 / 8.1 have some bluetooth issues where using any codec other than SBC completely borks the mic making the headphones useless for taking calls or using assistant. I'm going to pretend I can tell the difference between SBC and LDAC so I would recommend you use that on any Android 8.0+ devices.

Bose were also the choice for the longest time, and I never really liked the sound of them compared to non-bass boost Sony products. So that's where I'm coming from.

Recently I got some Apple AirPods for running, though, and just loved the freedom from wires. After catching my headphone cords on something I asked why I wasn't going bluetooth for my ""nice"" headphones.

I ended up going with these because they'd received great reviews from audio experts and it seemed like noise canceling had come a long way.

In actual experience...
- Sound quality is great. Way better than my in-ear Sonys. I didn't expect that.
- Noise canceling still bugged me at first, but I got used to it, and on balance I now really like it. I knocks down so much ambient garbage. I would kid myself on airplanes that the earbuds did a good enough job, but they don't. Not even close. These are great.
- Bluetooth is very strong. I sometimes forget my iPhone X on the desk and can walk across the house without a problem.
- Touch controls are actually great. I was a little worried about them, but they are easy to use once you get it.
- Battery life is great. Occasionally I'll think to charge them and have never run out.
- Case is really nice.
- Included cable works well if you end up needing it.

One complaint... The ear pads are a little too small, so my ear ends up touching the foam covering the driver. This makes them uncomfortable for long periods. I've seen online that you can actually use replacement Bose ear pads to bump them off your ears, and have taken them apart with a collar stay to see how to do it, which is very easy. So it's possible I'll make that upgrade, though I'm reluctant, because the replacement pads are kinda ugly. Oh well.

I really wish the app would allow you to disable some of the control points on the headphone. I truly only need to pause and play. Vol up/down and skip fwd/back is not a necessity I need to have.

Love the EQ options and available when the headset is connected to a phone, but when you connect it to the kindle fire.. there is no sony headphone app equivalent in the kindle app store. Which brings up that one kick-in-the-nuts that the Bose competing headset has over this one, in which it can connect to two devices at the same time.

On the plus, I'm loving the option of ambient sound. I believe this is exclusive to only Sony compared to Bose as their equivalent only has an option of high/low/off for noise control. All and All, I think this comparison would be split upon personal preferences and use environments.

I have yet to see if the hands free options for noise control when standing, walking, in motion, and running {running is not an option for this headset} works when you're connected to a device without GPS, but I'm sure you will lose this feature on a device without GPS (like my kindle fire). So without the dual device connection, the app is pretty much useless when connected to devices without the app support.

Without owning the equivalent headset, this is my review thus far. I think Sony has taken a big swing at a lot of options, but the smaller issues are starting to annoy me to a point in which one day I may not be ok with saying this is acceptable for a $300 pair of headphones while the bigger advantages go unused because my preferred listening device is not a GPS enabled phone and is not a device that has the sony headphone app to support it.

Without the highs, I'm left with normal and irritating lows in which I might look to either buy a lower priced version with the same options I do use, or look for something that fits a bit tighter to my lifestyle right now at or near the same quality. For now, it feels like I bought a Ferrari, but all the streets in my city has random pot holes with a max speed limit of 55 mph.",Sometimes a bigger bat is not the answer for smaller balls.

I did a lot of research and decided on these over the Bose QC35 and i believe i made the right choice. My co-worker has the Bose and i wasn't all that impressed with the sound, their volume seemed really low even when it was all the way up, but they are lighter and it could be argued, more comfortable than these.

These headphones offer great noise cancellation and amazing sound. I listen mainly to instrumental music like original scores and even my previous audiotechnica headphones which i thought were very good (for the price anyway, no comparison here) fell short in reproducing clear sound in certain notes. These so far have mastered every single note. The sound is loud and clear always.

My previous headphones weren't wireless or noise cancelling, so these are an upgrade for me and while they are not as lightweight as the Bose i have no complaints in regards to comfort; they certainly feel very comfortable to me. I think the app that comes with them could be improved and the software all together could be made easier to manage, but i do use it and it works fine for me, it just seems a bit more complicated than it probably should be.

Things you should know: Your phone or digital device must support AptX HD or LDAC in order for you to experience the sound quality that these are capable of while in Bluetooth mode. SBC is a lossy connection standard and the sound quality is noticeably poorer in this mode. This will be true for any high-end Bluetooth headphone. So you're wasting your money if your music source can't support better codecs. LDAC is built into Android Oreo (8.1.0). Related to this issue, some features in the application are only available when the phones are connected using SBC, which means if you want the equalizer, sound stage, or sound location features, you need to sacrifice the overall quality. Fortunately these are mostly useless features, so I just leave the connection in LDAC.

You can't disable the gesture feature on the right can, which can be irritating. You will unintentionally lower or raise volume, skip songs, etc. if you play with your headphones at all. There should be a button on the device to disable or enable gestures. For an expensive set of headphones, I would expect this feature to be there. That being said, the gestures are very convenient while traveling.

The charging cable is micro-USB and isn't very fast. Instead of a charge full indicator (e.g., a green light), the red light simply turns off. I would expect a better system for this given the quality of this device. I would expect a type-C connector with much faster charging.

All that said, I recommend these headphones. With LDAC support, the sound quality is outstanding for a wireless pair of phones. I took these on multiple train rides and flights and these phones blocked out most of the ambient noise. I also worked in a coffee shop for hours on end and these phones blocked out groups of teenagers and kids playing around. I've heard the ANC isn't as good as the Bose QC 35 II, but I find the level of noise cancellation more than sufficient.","Great sound, solid ANC, and decent comfort."

I've never owned such an expensive pair of headphones before, so understand that my opinion may be not fully credible. However here is what I have found. The audio quality is on another level compared to what I am used to. It's like not only is everything so clear and vivid. But (assuming the audio file isn't a bad one) I can also tell where the individual instruments would be playing if I were standing in the recording room. To experience this, listen to Give It One by Maynard Ferguson that track blew my socks off. The noise canceling is also pretty impressive, although I don't have much comparison as I've never owned a pair of active noise canceling headphones. It seems to me that it'll block out most noises below a certain volume threshold. So like I can still hear this ridiculously loud vacuum we have (you have no idea how loud this vacuum is though), or the blender when standing right next to it. Even then, those things weren't more noticeable than the music I was listening to, so it seems to do its job almost perfectly.

The Bad

There actually aren't any huge complaints, but the reason it doesn't get a perfect score is because it does have some flaws that I think really do need to be improved upon (only 2 to be exact though). The first one is that my ears get really hot after wearing them for a bit over an hour or two. So much so that I feel compelled to take them off for a minute or two just because the heat is pretty unbearable. The second is that it creaks every now and then when you stretch out the headband even a little. The second isn't even really a huge complaint I guess, because I don't think (and really hope) that Sony would make sure that the headband doesn't end up breaking.

Summary

Audio quality is next level compared to what I am used to and the noise canceling executes its job to the best of its ability. In future generations, I would obviously like to see even better audio quality and noise canceling (as hard as that may be) as well as an environment where it feels like my ears aren't being dipped in molten lava after just an hour or two (exaggeration, but they do get really hot for real). I highly recommend these, and honestly still can't decide if I am being too harsh in giving this a 4-star review. Most people either give this a 4 or 5-star review I assume and those that don't either had a really bad experience for some external factor or are out of their mind.",Best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I highly recommend them to pretty much everyone.
