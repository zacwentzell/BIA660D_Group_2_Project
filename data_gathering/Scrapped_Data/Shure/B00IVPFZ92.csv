0,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this headset to use with the system at the gym to instruct a spin class. I got this set because I knew it would work with the set up. Before purchasing, make sure the system being used will be compatible with this headset. Since the gym already has the set up, I can just connect to the battery pack they have. There is a wire, but it connects to the battery pack which attaches to your clothing. I have to tuck the wire down my shirt so it doesn’t get caught on the handlebars of the spin bike. Without tucking the wire, I have had a few embarrassing moments where the wire has caught on the handlebars. To clarify, it is wireless as you you’re not connected to the system. But you’re connected to the battery pack which you connect to your clothing. You can walk around freely and move freely. It even worked when one of the instructors went outside and forgot to turn off the battery pack, she was away and outside of the building and the sound still was heard without any issues. There is a little foam piece that connects to the mouthpiece to help you not sound so winded. I can hear myself breathing but it doesn’t come through the speakers. It fits my head only if I have my hair tied a certain way, I think I have a small head because the other instructors who have the same headset don’t seem to have any issue no matter which way they style their hair. I sweat a lot while instructing and the sweat has not had any problem with the sound, I do take the foam piece off after each use to let it dry. It comes with 2 foam pieces so you can switch them out."
1,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this headset after my other Shure went out after less than a year. I was hoping putting a little more of an investment into my next set would be worth it -- and so far so good! I really like how much more durable this one seems to be. I make sure to dry it off after every class as well as remove the windscreen and allow the mic to hang until the next time I use it. I never wrap the cord tightly around the set either, so I'm hoping my good habits ensure a long life for this one."
2,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wired mic for teaching Grouo Fitness classes- no more sharing germs and hair grime with other instructors. Super easy to attach to the transmitter pack, slim and compact for storage too. Looking to purchase the transmitter soon"
3,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had several of these. Work great but don't be fooled, sweat in the mike will kill it."
4,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To sensitive to sweat. No matter what you do with the windscreen sponge. It should have extra screens. There should be many screens. They should be available to purchase. You still get it wet, and it still stops working in a few months. We have no choice here, but it is what it is."
5,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked fine on the proper pack setting for 2 months. A couple of weeks ago it stopped working at all on proper setting. I've tried on packs at all 5 gyms I teach at. I have to use the cheaper mic setting to get any volume, on which the mic feeds back regularly. The feedback causes me to feel like I can't move freely around the stage and that I have to overly meter the volume of my voice (and I'm not a loud person). It feels unprofessional. I am very disappointed to look for help today and see that I could only have gotten support with this issue within the first 2 months. Fitness instructors expect their mic to work for years, not months. Super frustrating."
6,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this while livestreaming my workouts on Zwift for a few months now. It's very lightweight, hardly noticeable while working with it. the only possible flaw is that the microphone picks up wind noise from a small fan I have set up in front of me. I've solved this by moving the fan off to the side, and the wind noise disappeared. You'll also need to take time to set your speakers up to not get echo, but it's worth the couple of minutes of effort."
7,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,3.0 out of 5 stars,I used this maybe 15 times and the connection to the transmitter button got stuck in transmitter and cannot get it out. Stopped working during my class! Up until then it worked great??

3,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,I do indoor cycle classe with this and it gets pretty soaked with sweat. It holds up very well and is very comfortable. Other models have not held up as well.

5,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good."
6,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overly sensitive in both studios I teach. I often get feedback. After 10 mins it seems to stabilize. But then 40 minutes in I have to keep increasing my volume. Maybe I have a bum unit?
7,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just the best, is great that you can replace this in older equipments."

9,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,3.0 out of 5 stars,It seems to have good clear quality however the only draw back was it slips off of my hair. Need a head band if your hair is straight very distracting.
0,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,good product.

2,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful - great to have crisp clear sound again!
3,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
4,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Deceptive marketing!!! We purchased this specifically because we wanted a wireless headset for our trainers to easily move about without ripping the wires off during demonstrations. As it turns out, it's wireless only to the receiver... the actual headset is NOT, even though it says wireless and even shows the headset without wires. Of course it's wireless from the headset to the receiver! Very deceptive! Waste of time, energy and money. Will return."
5,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this mic it's confurtable gives great voice output. Best fitness mic I have use so far.
6,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,1.0 out of 5 stars,BE AWARE. ITS NOT WIRELESS
7,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic
8,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a gift that will not be opened or used until mid November so I can't really tell you. I'm sure it will be great. It is for someone who teaches exercise classes.
9,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's supposed to be a wireless headset. It is not wireless. Very misleading.
0,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Should make it clear that you must purchase the complete system. Disappointed, now I need to purchase another piece to complete set"
1,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headset to teach classes at my gym who uses the SHURE system for Group ex classes so i wouldnt have to share the headset that is a tad worn out (150+ classes a week) and they use the slightly less expensive PGA 31 mic. not only is this mic (i bought it just for the comfort) so much more comfortable and sturdy, my class participants say that the quality in sound is noticeably better than the other mic headset. It uses the same 4 prong connection in to the microphone transmitter (belt pack aka butt pack)"
2,Shure SM31FH Wireless Fitness Headset Condenser Microphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound from this headset is very clear and stays in place well on your head. As other reviewers have indicated, no it is not completely wireless, the wire goes from the headset to the mic pack (not included). This is as I expected and as similar headsets operate. I would definitely recommend this headset, which is at a great price point for the quality."
