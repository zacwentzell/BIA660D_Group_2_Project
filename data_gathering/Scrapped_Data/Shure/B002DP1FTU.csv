0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Shure SRH440 came included with our high-end electronic keyboard we bought. They lasted about 9 months before the plastic piece that keeps the earmuff attached to the head-piece (or whatever) broke. So in other words, the ear muff was dangling by the little wire.

OK, we had some bad luck. So we ordered a new one from Amazon. In less than 3 months, the earmuff was broken off again. See pic.

The headphones are comfortable on my head and ears. The sound quality is good and the noise cancellation is good as well. But they just keep breaking under reasonable usage circumstance. Admittedly, teenagers (girls) also use these but they stay parked at our computer 100% of the time and I did not feel like our use case was extreme. Yes, the kids dropped them off the table occasionally and these were probably dropped on the floor a couple times, but for $90 I don't feel like they are very durable. Otherwise they are good headphones

If you are going to use them in a studio or placid environment and totally pamper them then there's nothing wrong. I'm just disappointed in their durability. Ordered a Sennheiser HD280PRO and build quality seems much better at the ear muff. Haven't owned them long enough to say they are better, but from looking at the ear muff attachment I do not think my next problem will be that.

No fault to the vendor or Amazon. I never bother with reviews but I just wanted to point this problem out.

UPDATE 11/29/2017: The Sennheiser HD280PROs are still great and haven't broken yet. Definitely recommend you purchase them over the Shure SRH440."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was recently in need of closed headphones with a $100 budget and curious about what the market offers. I thought I might share my findings with someone in a similar situation. The Shure SRH440 turns out to be the most accurate, neutral sounding closed cans among the eight headphone models that I have compared. Below is my review of these headphones.

I am a speaker builder with measurement equipment, so I know what is neutral and undistorted sound. Unlike speaker systems, most headphones have no crossover or frequency response correction circuit. So, it is critical to be able to know how much such uneven responses affect perception of their sound with respect to accuracy and neutrality. I have good sense of it since I have been measuring sound. But I do not have proper equipment for headphone measurement, mostly importantly a dummy torso/head, nor am I willing to invest time in making a DIY setup. This is the reason why my search and audition have been limited to headphones for which measurement data exist, with some exceptions (see below). I made use of three different sources for the data: InnerFidelity.com, Headphone.com, and en.GoldenEars.net. While there is consistency within each site's measurements, there is also inconsistency between them, due to different measurement conditions and compensation methods. So, I researched and took those into account.

One may say we can use EQ to remedy irregular frequency responses. But EQ has its own limitations. Some minor EQ'ing can help, but headphones that need too extensive correction should be avoided. The foremost reason is the loss of dynamic range. Theoretically, with EQ you can only limit, not increase, dynamic range in a certain frequency band. On the source side, you lose digital bit depth, and on the headphone side, you suppress the driver's efficient response range.

Below is the list of headphones that I have auditioned (in the order of their street prices):

- Tascam TH-02 ($30; no data available)
- Panasonic RP-HTF600-S ($32; semi-open headphones)
- Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 ($35; no data available)
- Tascam TH-2000 ($50; no data available)
- AKG K518LE ($50)
- Sennheiser HD 429 ($65)
- Creative Aurvana Live! ($70)
- KRK KNS 6400 ($85)
- Shure SRH440 ($90)

My DIY speaker system (it measures very flat) served as a reference with respect to tonal balance. I also own some open headphones like Sony MDR-MA900 and Sennheiser PX100, which also provided a baseline when I evaluated tonal balance of the headphones under comparison. I used a desktop headphone amp that has flat FR and reasonably low output impedance.

I will give short, summarized impressions for each pair.

Tascam TH-02 (no measurement data available)
This is a really nice surprise. There is a little hump in the bass and midbass regions, and some wide, shallow dip in upper mids and lower treble (i.e., slightly polite presentation). Otherwise, these are relatively accurate headphones at a fraction ($30) of cost of headphones of comparable quality. Construction is good for the price. The pad size is between over-ear and on-ear, but comfortable enough.

Panasonic RP-HTF600-S (semi-open headphones)
Warm tone, deep bass. Treble is there, but upper mids and lower treble are lacking. Comfortable to wear. A good value, but not great for those looking for reasonably accurate sound.

Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 (no data available)
Mid/upper bass ruins the sound which has otherwise good midrange-treble balance. Very uncomfortable to wear due to non-swivel cups.

Tascam TH-2000 (no data available)
Simply inferior to its younger brother TH02. Very dull and muddy presentation. The model uses the same ear cups as TH02 but contains different drive units. The driver may have better components but execution must be bad. Not worth the asking price.

AKG K518LE
You need to remove the thick foam pad at the driver's front (easily removable) to have better bass-to-mids balance. Even the pad removed, the phones still have bass-oriented sound, but not bad. Mids to treble balance is good. Somewhat similar sound signature to Tascam TH-02's. But the TH-02 sounds a little more natural. The headband can be too small for some people. The clamping force is a bit above a comfortable level.

Sennheiser HD 429
Anothter pair of headphones with bass emphasis. Not overly bassy, though. But a bigger problem is treble, which is a little too polite to be neutral. I would not consider these headphones a good value.

Creative Aurvana Live!
Smooth and warm tone. Bass is somewhat loose at times. Treble has sparkles and at the same time sounds smooth. But relative to bass and treble, upper mids and lower treble are somewhat recessed, making the headphones' sound colored. Some people may feel them musical and full, but I prefer the Tascam TH02 at a lower price. The appearance is very good, though, with some feel of high quality. Very comfortable to wear with memory foam pads.

KRK KNS 6400
It has much more neutral sound than the headphones described above. Mid- and upper bass is somewhat lacking, and treble is a little overly presented. Good monitor-type sound. But there is one problem with these headphones. They are not very efficient, which means their usability is limited---you need a desktop headphone amp or a high-current capable portable amp to make them sound good. A little too bright treble is a weakness, too.

Shure SRH440
Without doubt, these are the best of the bunch. Perceived dynamic range is unbelievably wide. These are in a different league in terms of clarity as well---perhaps, the KNS 6400 is close but also with weaknesses (see above). Treble is sometimes a little on the bright side, but not as bright as the KNS6400's. Some people may find them bright with bright recordings, but the headphones should not be blamed for that. These produce very neutral and accurate sound. Bass is sufficient and often pleasantly strong in the mid- and upper bass regions, but deeper bass is not covered by these cans. Most music recordings do not contain this deep bass, anyway.

I summarize my findings with the following top two picks:

1. Shure SRH440: These are the headphones you can safely choose under $100 if what you are looking for is accurate, neutral sound.

2. Tascam TH-02: This is a secret gem. At $30, you get really good closed cans. Its overall presentation is not as clear as the SRH440's, but with their price factored in, you cannot complain. They are definitely in the same league as the AKG K518LE (foam pads removed) and the Creative Aurvana Live. It may depend on personal preference, but among the three, my pick is the Tascam. The Creative has a better look and feel, but I'd choose the Tascam for its sound.

Another headphone model I wanted to include in my search was the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro ($90-$100), but after I listened to the Shure SRH440, I decided not to. According to HeadRoom's measurements and many people's common impressions, the HD 280 Pro has a little subdued treble compared to the SRH440 which has great mids to treble balance when compared to my reference speakers. The Sennheiser covers the lowest octave much better than the Shure, but that is not my priority.

I also considered the Koss ProDJ100 because of good reviews, but ruled them out because of their measurements. Their response might be flat in fundamental tones from most instruments but not with harmonics due to a large dip around 5-6kHz. Some people may think they sound good, but there is no way for them to sound accurate and natural by my standard."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
* Excellent frequency balance. All bands from low to high are represented well and fairly, not overwhelmingly.
* Very sensitive to quiet sounds, so high volume is almost never necessary, especially in a quiet room.
* In Overwatch terms, around the time of release this meant that if you set the volume such that the loudest possible 2khz square wave no longer caused pain, you could then use the same volume setting and, while standing at the factory entrance in King's Row, still hear a reaper walking upstairs. In the far deck. In short, ""rip headphone users"" should make no sense to you as nothing can cause you pain and you can hear everything.
* Isolation is good enough for moderate fan noise.

Cons:
* Headband lasts about 2 years tops for me as both pairs I've owned have broken at the thin sliding plastic joint
* Headphones are so heavy that your neck muscles will probably need some training to get used to them.
* Headphones are so heavy that the top of my head began to develop a bald spot from long term use. After switching to KRK studio headphones which are much lighter (but not as bright sounding as these), the bald spot grew back within a month.

In short, know that you will have an interesting, yet inherently transient experience with these headphones. Don't expect to pass them to your grandchildren or anything."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start my review I would like to say that I'm not a musician and I don't know anything about recording or mixing audio. I got sick and tired of cheaper headphones that needed an extreme EQ adjustment to sound even across the entire frequency spectrum. I wanted to try headphones were supposed to have neutral sound and was as close to having a flat linear frequency response as possible.

I fell in love with them the instant I heard them for the first time. Everything sounded so clean, so balanced and not even once made me want to turn on an EQ. I even played back a frequency sweep on them and I couldn't hear any of the frequencies being any louder or quieter then any of the others. These headphones match my ears' own natural frequency response very well.

I've seen quite a few people complain the there's not enough bass, but not to me. I think it's spot on. It's very tight, clean, and accurate and never gets sloppy or muddy even on the most bass heavy songs. The midrange is nice and wide and full. In fact, the midrange was the very first thing I noticed and is something I never knew I was missing so badly and wanted more of compared to all my previous headphones in my past. The treble is sharp and crystal clean and clear and detailed but yet not harsh to my ears at all. Everything is all in balance and totally flat just as I was expecting and wanting in these headphones. In fact I even reverted my iPod back to stock firmware from rockbox because I no longer have to tame my headphones' sound with an custom EQ.

These are so far the best (and most expensive) headphones I've ever owned. I absolutely love how the sound and I think they're perfect in that aspect.

Why 4 stars then?
2 words, build quality. These headphones feel really weak and the used pair I had before buying these brand new broke right at it's hinge exactly how a few other reviewers on this site had shown and I'm afraid my new ones might do that. Also, even after very light usage, my headphone jack is starting to bend at the tip. But hey, that's what having a replaceable cable is for and I've seen some pretty nice and extra durable looking third-party cables out there for these. ;)

EDIT: The right side completely broke off and I had to do a MacGyver style repair to get them back together. But the sound is still just as good though."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: August 2012
Shure replaced my phones!
I wrote to them as well as called them. Very friendly staff.
Turns out there was a Shure partner in New Delhi and I went to their location and they changed the phones for new ones on the spot. With two years manufacturers warranty, that's awesome.
The design flaw still stands of course. I'm Shure they'll fix it.
I wouldn't want to use another set of cans. These are just perfect.

UPDATE: July 2012
There is a metal T shaped hook that fits into the top (head) piece. Its held in place by a plastic cap covered by 4 small screws. This plastic cap has broken on my right cup and its about to break on the left as well (I just checked).

This plastic ""cap"" that holds down the metal T joint, is very easy to break. It broke on my right can and is almost broken on the left as well. Ive put up some pictures.

I really think Shure needs to look into this and strengthen the design at the joints.

These caps should've been made of metal. Mind you, I have used these phones VERY VERY carefully. I don't see these working in a real commercial studio environment.

Apart from that still a great sounding pair of cans.
______________________________________________________
My mixes improved when i started using these cans.

They do bring out reasonable mid range detail you want to hear when you're EQ'ing your mixes. They are decently transparent and have close to a flat response.

To know exactly how the response of these cans are, search ""Shure SRH440 + frequency response""

They are reasonably flat upto say 3khz and then there's a dip from 3 to 8 khz followed by a spike to return to normal at say 10khz after which the response falls off.

i did some research and chose these over the 840. A Shure engineer or something like that said these were better for mastering/mixing. You can google ""Shure 440 vs 840"" if you'd like to confirm.

I just didn't really like the plastic feel of some of the connectors. I guess its not a big deal.

I'll update this review next year to write on how it worked out for me."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Older and more dynamic material can sound great on these things. The flat and well-defined midrange is by far the best part. The bass works best with more pronounced or acoustic sounds. The treble may roll off a bit early for some tastes, but I found it balanced enough to do the job. Listening is accurate and modest. Bass will never thump, and ""S"" sounds won't scream at you.

Comfort concerns might be overstated in other reviews. I wouldn't wear them for hours at a time, but they're still a solid enough fit for my average-sized head, and fairly comfy. The detachable cord is a big win in my book, and has saved me from tangled nightmares and any fear of breaking the connector."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: I must update this review to mention that these headphones have broken like many others who have posted reviews. The sliding hinge no longer sticks and the headphones on the left hand side simply fall apart. I can push the metal interior back into the housing which keeps them sort of working for a few times until the friction of use breaks them again. Very frustrating, as it has only been 7 months and I have taken extremely good care of them.

Previous review:

I've owned these headphones for four months, wearing them about 4-6 hours per work day. They are the single most uncomfortable pair of headphones I've ever used out-of-the-box. This is a very relative bias, but after seeing other reviews claiming they are very comfortable, I don't want to steer others into the same trap. If you find them comfortable enough, you're lucky! I had coworkers try them out and comment, and receive all negative feedback in terms of comfort.

Here's what I bought along these headphones in order to increase the comfort to allow for all day use:

- Velour ear pads http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OM06RG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Extra cushion support http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00862522A/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Standard black velcro

I took the extra cushion support and put black velcro along the back and along the top of the headphones. This provided the perfect amount of cushion. The replacement ear pads also increased comfort.

As for the quality, they are perfect for my needs and there are plenty of more technical reviews to base opinions from. Overall after lightly modifying the stock headset, I'm very happy."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440 headphones are sturdy and seem to be generally well constructed. As per the experience of many other reviewers, I found the ear cups and the headband to be quite uncomfortable (the headband began to pressure the top of my head almost immediately.)

I have already replaced the ear cups with the Shure SRH840 models (available on Amazon for $14.49) and they do indeed provide a much more comfortable fit. I have also ordered a ""Replacement Upgrade Headband Comfort Cushion Pad in Leatherette with snap locks"" (not sold by Shure - but also available on Amazon for $8.95). The trouble is, my $99 headphones now have cost me over $125 with shipping. So what do you get for $125?

The Pros:

* Quality construction and durability * Fairly precise separation between instruments, and quite good vocal reproduction * Decent soundstage (a sense of the instruments and/or musicians being in distinct places on the stage) * Generally non fatiguing listening

The Cons:

* Ouch. Fairly extensive modifications necessary to make the headphones comfortable (at least for me). These are supposed to be ""studio"" headphones. What gives? * Overall pretty flat sound reproduction. Hearing these 'phones will not knock you out of your chair - but they certainly won't make you wince either. * Depending on the source, the highs can be both ""bright"" and ""mushy"". This description sounds contradictory, but I feel it's accurate. Cymbals, horns, and other instrumental treble can be somewhat harsh and tinny - but at the same time ill-defined and ""smeared.""

For those who are wondering, I'm powering these phones with an HRT Headstreamer headphone amp/DAC - so they should be getting sufficient boost (and digital music should be smoothed out).

The Bottom Line:

I may have been a bit harsh in my description of these 'phones since I am used to the true audiophile-quality pair that I use for home listening. If you've been listening to your music and video on a pair of $14 earbuds, these Shures will be a very substantial upgrade, no doubt. For $99 bucks, they seem like a pretty decent deal - although when you add the expense of new ear cups and headband, it becomes a somewhat less obvious call. Other people really love these 'phones - and after a ""burn-in"" period, I may find there's more to enjoy."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as monitor headphones for my small recording studio. I had another pair of isolation headphones, but these are better and the others are now backup units, or engineer units, because these isolate the monitor sound on performers _really_ effectively - sound goes in performers' ears and _not_ your mics. If you've ever had a click track bleed through to your microphone - or even had to work to prevent it - get a pair of these and relax.

And that's with the standard pads, too - the ones that come with the 440. A lot of people swap out the higher-end pads for comfort, but I find these pads perfectly acceptable, and as before, the sound containment is just great. I haven't had the weight problem others have mentioned, but I take my headset off whenever I can - too much headgear time can damage your hearing, and nobody needs _that_. I could see the top padding being inadequate for long-term wearing, though.

These aren't my listening-for-pleasure headphones, but that's not what they're for; they don't do any of the sound sweetening you're used to hearing on home headsets. But when mixing an album, _you don't want that kind of help_. You want to sound good _without_ that, and that's what these are for. They have the nice flat, even reference sound - similar to my studio flat reference speakers, tho' not _as_ flat - which you need for recording. In short, they do what they say on the tin: they're studio reference headsets. Not pleasure-listening headsets. And for that job, they're great."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones back in May 2012 as they were the cheapest headphones that had a detachable cable. I'm not a big audiophile, but these headphones sound good, and I've had too many pairs of Sennheisers die on me from faulty cables.

As of this writing (Dec 2013) the cable still has no issues. I have, however, broken one of the joints in the headband that allow the cups to fold/articulate for comfort. I was able to superglue an extremely tiny plastic piece together and rebuild the headphones almost as they were. This patch has held for a few months, but I expect this point of failure will be the death of these headphones. This same weak point maybe the source of several of the 1-star reviews. I do emphasize tiny: There are two screws in a couple mm wide piece of plastic that hold the joint together, and supergluing the plastic together without accidentally glueing the join shut was quite infuriating.

I still will keep the review at 4 stars, despite having to do a repair since I like how these headphones sound, find them otherwise comfortable, and frankly, my other headphones (mostly Sennheisers) have all died entirely far sooner than these, all from their integrated wiring.

Last thought: The coiled cable that comes with this is quite long. It can easy stretch 7-8 ft, but after that it starts to pull an awkward bit of tension. I find though this is a good length for desk usage since you can stand up and stretch without needing to take them off."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality - lasted me about a year and decided to buy another pair that works beautifully. Sound quality is great and the comfort leaves a little to be desired, as it can get a little uncomfortable if you keep them on long enough, but in my mind the quality of the sound is enough to make up for this. The cord is long enough to let you move around with relative freedom without feeling like you're going to get unplugged or erode the wires."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound fantastic. Much better sound than many Bose or Beats headphones that cost hundreds more. These are very highly rated elsewhere on the internet and didn't disappoint. I still use them today. Shure makes very high quality headphones and microphones.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for the price. They remind me of the Bose Triports I used to own, but with way more definition and clarity in the mids/upper range.

It's hard to find headphones are a well balanced. I listen to a wide variety of music, and I've yet to find a piece that doesn't sound great.

My only complaint (minor as it is) is the cable. It's coiled. Unless your connection is right next to you, the tension on the cable causes a slight (or more) tugging sensation on your head/neck. It's minor and easily corrected with an extension cable."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"(just sayin these are my first pair of monitor headphones)
ya my first BUT i have listened to ALOT of head phones including: sony giiq, sennheiser, bose, philips, and crappy beats by dre. i owned the sony bose and philips and these are the best of all. if your looking in the range of $50-150 get these. if your thinking about beats NO NO NO NO $300 for head phones that suck worse than sony giiq's. no JUST NOOO

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I *love* my new 440's. They're exactly what I was looking for in a circumaural design.

Pros:
-Frequency response is phenomenal. Only a hardcore audio engineer could find a flaw in these.
-Removable cable! I think this is an undervalued attribute. If the cable accidentally gets cut, you can just replace it for about $10. It locks into the left earpice, is think and beefy, has a big fat strain relief on the plug end, and has a useful coil in the middle. A 1/4in adapter screws (yes, screws) onto the end.
-Closed design: When fit snuggly on your head, there is very little bleed out. I can listen loud without fear of disturbing others in a quiet room. Good external noise cancellation, too, although this was not expected.

Cons:
-The cushions. They were WAY too shallow for my head. That is to say, they fit *around* my ears just fine, there's just not enough *depth* inside. My ears would get squished up against the sharp plastic grill inside because the cushions were not think enough. There is a very, very thin layer of material which goes over the drivers, but not enough to make a difference.

*** Worth noting: I told Shure about the cushions and the pain that I was enduring when wearing these, and inquired about buying a thicker pair of pads. They responded the next day and shipped me a pair of pads from their most expensive headphones (880's, I think?). These are MUCH better, featuring a slightly squisher and thicker pad, as well as a nice thick layer of foam stuff which covers up the plastic grill. KUDOS TO YOU, Shure!!!!

Highly recommended, as long as you can get your hands on the better pads. Or, if you have really small ears which don't stick out from your head too far.

5 stars, because of the Shure customer service."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not what most people would call an audiophile, but I do love my music. I listen to speed/thrash/death metal and lots of different genres of techno. There are a few other types of music thrown in there, but this is the majority of what I've listened to through these phones, so far.

My previous pair of headphones were by Creative. They were not bad. But these Shures absolutely blow them out of the water! I'm hearing parts of the music I had never heard before. The richness of any song made with decent studio equipment is just awesome.

I listen to music through my PC with a Creative X-Fi sound card. I know that this can introduce a lot of ""noise"" in the music. Frankly, I've never noticed it. The Shures do not amplify this, either (although, I may just be deaf to it...?).

With the equalizer set to ""flat"", I get very good bass from the techno, but the solos in the metal also sound really crisp. Also, the crushing power riffs in the metal are extremely satisfying.

I just want to finish by saying that there have been several times while listening to music and doing something else (surfing the web or reading) I would stop what I was doing and just sit in absolute awe of the sound quality coming out of these earphones. These make me wish I had plunked down the cash for a quality pair of headphones much, much sooner in my life.

I hope you enjoy them as much as I do, if that's even possible. XD"
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace a broken pair of ATH-M50 headphones. The ATH-M50 headphones sound great, but I wanted to see if these could perform just as well for a fairly cheaper price (about $50 cheaper. I got these for about $75). Here are my conclusions:

- I found that the clarity of the SRH440 is equal to that of the ATH-M50.
- The SRH440 has better sound dampening. Less sound escapes the earcups.
- The SRH440 has an awesome detachable cable and has a strong build. These seem like they will last for a while.
- The comfort level is on par, or even better than cans in this price range. Sliding adjusters make it easy to find the best comfort. The ATH-M50 swivels in more directions than the SRH440, but that does not take anything away from the 440s for me.

- The ATH-M50 has stronger bass that also reaches lower levels, although statistically, the SRH440 has a wider frequency range which could reach lower lows than the ATH-M50.
- The most significant difference to me is the sound stage (spatial interpretation of instruments). The ATH-M50 has a slightly recessed midrange that, In my opinion, gives the vocals a instruments a more natural and pleasing sound. This doesn't take away how great the SRH440 sounds, but sometimes it feels a bit more in your head than spaced out.

Overall, I rate these a 4 out of 5 because they outperform many headphones in this price range. The the only gripe I have about these headphones is that the soundstage is not that great."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these headphones sound great. Bass is slightly recessed, but still very present and well-reproduced, just not overpowering (if you're used to headphones like the Beats By Dre, you might think that they have weak bass).

Unfortunately, in order to make these headphones even remotely comfortable, you're going to need to spend another $30 or so to modify them.

The headband is made of not-terribly-soft rubber, wrapped in pleather. This is nowhere near as comfortable as an actual cushion. Since there is not much clamping force from the earpads, the headphones slide down and the band feels like it's trying to make an indentation in the top of your head. My solution: I attached a Sennheiser HD580 headband cushion (Part Number H-52715) to the underside of the headband with velcro tape. It made them INFINITELY more comfortable.

A lot of people complain that the earpads are uncomfortable. Personally, I didn't think they were too bad, but I still went ahead and replaced them with SRH840 earpads (Part Number HPAEC840). They've given the headphones a nice cushy feel - though personally, I don't think that the sound has changed noticeably (some have reported that it increases bass and mellows high frequencies). Softness-wise, the 440 pads could be likened to three-day-old bread; the 840 pads are like a fresh loaf of bread.

After these modifications, my 440s are every bit as comfortable as the JVC HA-RX700's they replaced, but with crisper sound and much better midrange reproduction.

EDIT 10/4/11 - After a few months of use, these headphone remain comfortable with the modifications I made. However, I find myself wishing they had more bass. Enough so to it's a bit annoying to me. Turning the volume high enough for decent bass results in overpowering ear-stabbing highs. Overall, the SRH440s are still more enjoyable than the JVC HA-RX700 for music, but I think the much-cheaper JVCs were actually a bit better for movies & gaming."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't know if I should call myself an audiophile or not, but I definitely hear and appreciate quality. I can still hear the full range I should be able to and have tested that up to 20khz. It only got painful, not quieter. :)

I received these headphones recently and have been trying them out for all kinds of music, from piano by Glass through Mozart through Daft Punk, The Glitch Mob, various top 40 tracks and various scores and soundtracks.

Bass:
I have read a lot of reviews that said that these headphones are light on bass. First let me add my two cents on that one. These headphones have plenty of bass. I have to wonder if the people who said it wasn't really there have some minor hearing loss. Nothing against them, but if you value clarity and not just bass then these are probably the right pick for you. I have listened to Klipsch, and similarly priced Sennheisers and those were lighter on clarity and heavy on bass. In my personal opinion, too much bass can make even clear mids sound muddled.

Clarity:
These headphones, as others have pointed out, have really brought out color in the music and subtle details that are lost in most headphones and earphones I've listened to. You can hear everything, from the change of direction of a bow on a string to the click of the c or k sound in a singer's throat. I've actually started listening for those details and have found detail within sounds in synth and artists like eDiT that I never knew were there. It enhances the visceral experience of the music.

Burn-in:
I haven't burned these in yet and from what I understand, they will get even better when they do.

Comfort:
I can see that over long periods, the headband may not be the most comfortable thing in the world compared to some of the others that I've tried. It hasn't been a problem for me though, but then again, it's hard to find something that's so uncomfortable that it bothers me without actually causing soreness or pain.

Concerns:
I am so far only a little concerned with the exposed wires just above each of the cans. These won't be used outside the house though, so it may be just fine. It would worry me more if they were going to be used on the go.

Portability:
They're not. Don't even try."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first started using the SRH-440s, I was a little bit underwhelmed. After burning them in, they were spectacular.

SOUND

1. They are very well balanced, the highs aren't too high, the lows aren't too low. Everything is in harmony with each other.

2. The bass is perfect and there when it should be.

3. The noise isolation is very effective. Jumping from a pair of noise-cancelling Bose or the well branded Beats to these is barely noticeable. You won't get distracted by any outside noise.

4. I recommend burning these in, when I first got them sometimes the same sound or song would sound different. Now everything sounds pretty good and consistent, so I would definitely burn them in before regular use.

COMFORT

I got the SRH-840 pads as suggested by other comments. Haven't used the 440 pads period. The 840 pads are very comfortable for long sessions. They are't very heavy and won't weigh you down on their own, but the coil cable is long and adds a bit of weight. The band isn't really noticeable, which is good. It sits comfortably on my head, and I have a big head. There is plenty of room for even bigger heads as well.

VALUE

These headphones are an incredible value. They sound fantastic, are noise isolating (and compete with expensive noise-cancelling headphones), have a perfect amount of bass, are comfortable (especially with the 840 pads), and are under $100.

If you're just an amateur who wants a pair of headphones that an audiophile would find impressive but don't want to break the bank, go with these.

If you're looking for a good set of monitoring headphones on a budget, look no further. These are an impressive set of headphones. go get em!"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets start off saying that Shure said they were going to have my headphones shipped out on the 6-11 with a normal shipping option. They shipped it to me on the fourth.
That was a nice surprise. Now if your going to buy these headphones for long flights or long car rides forget it. There comfortable for about 40 minutes then they start to hurt. The sound quality on these are fantastic but you pay for it in bulk. There comparable to Bose headphones and are just what you would expect from Shure's other line of products. The durability on them seem to be good but I don't to test it's limits. It could probably survive a 1 story drop. If I were to do it over I would probably buy the SRH 240's or the SRH 740 DJ's.
Over all real good in sound, quality and durability accept for the bulk."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The brightness of the audio is over exaggerated, I really like the removable cable-/it would be nice if it came with a second cable that was straight,more suitable when recording as they are usually longer and less apt to get tangled.
At about the same price Sennheiser HD 280 pro sounds more balanced and has good isolation."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"really liked them!!! they're not that expensive, they have excellent noise cancelling and their portability is great, loved the design. they have a standard 3.5 mm jack, but come with a 6.5 mm adapter (which i lost, but you can but buy'em shure hpaqa1), which is a great feature."

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I hook up these baby and alli hear is music from ipod or music from my amp. The best part is..when the eife is babbling all i see is her mouth moving and i hear nothing!! the noise cancellation is by far the best ive tried yet.. The bose are good but this shure set is much better
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am no way an audiophile, but these 'phones have completely opened up music to me. I can differentiate instruments much better then my 20$ Panasonic headphones ever could, and music just sounds ""better"" now than it used to. Build quality is great from my (limited) experience they feel solid the cord is very nice. On the negative side they are still quite tight for my head and are quite heavy making somewhat discomforting for long periods of use (4+ hours).

All-in-all a great ""first"" pair of real 'phones."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I greatly enjoyed the sound of these headphones. They provide excellent noise isolation (from outside sounds) without being tight on the ears, and the sound is crisp & clear, but not harsh. Unfortunately after 1/2 hour the ear pads were pushing my glasses earpieces into my ears & head such that the combination created a very uncomfortable (hurting, even) area between my ears & head. I tried them with my glasses off for a little while, and they were much more comfortable, but still pushed on the top of my ears a bit. Perhaps my ears are just too big for these headphones. The headband isn't the most comfortable either, and pushed on my head uncomfortably after about 1/2 hour. I imagine that could be remedied after some additional adjustments. The quality & build is very high, as is the sound quality. So - final words - excellent sound & isolation, NOT good for glasses wearers."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted a newer pair of headphones for listening to music and TV. My old 70's Koss earphones were very outdated in sound and quality. These are wonderful. Comfortable, great sound, and fold for storage. Nice long cord. I bought a y adapter so my wife can plug in her Bose and I can plug my Shure when watching movies to hear better. I think my Shure sound better than her Bose. I am very happy with them."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones and I'm glad I bought them. I did a lot of research and felt like these were arguably the best pair for under $100 (at least on paper). I've had them a month or so and listened to them for many hours and they sound great. They're very clear and crisp and I like the noise cancellation. The default bass is just slightly flat for some types of music, but I still think you won't find anything close for this price. If you use any type of equalization then you can really do some cool things with theses. I wear these at work and people come up to me all the time and ask where I got them and if they can try them out and they love them too."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones broke after 7 months of light use . Made with cheep plastic for $99 they should last longer . Would not buy again !!!
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have good sound quality (although I'm not an audiophile), are sturdily constructed, and look good. Unfortunately, there is almost no padding where it touches the top of the head, making it uncomfortable as soon as I put it on (I have a shaved head). There is also almost no padding on the ear cup rims; I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable there, but I would definitely prefer more.

I bought Koss headphones for much less (10 years ago) and their padding was ideal. These Shure headphones will go in the closet as soon as I get my next set."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great, but there are two things that I wish were different:
1. I wish there was more cushion underneath the headband. After wearing them for a while the top of my head begins to get a bit sensitive. That might sound trivial, but I find myself shifting the headset slightly to relieve the pressure on the top of my head.
2. I thought that being an over the ear type unit it would insulate me from hearing distractions more than they actually do. I've tested noise-cancelling headsets and wasn't overly impressed with them either though."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, and a step up from the SRH240."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, went to a music shop and listened to pair after pair of headphones. These had the best clarity in my opinion. Everything is super crisp (dynamics on drums and cymbals, guitars, etc. come through really well). A bit less bass response than most of the others I tried, but worth it for the clarity.

I've had my for at least a couple of years now and use them pretty regularly and they're holding up well."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid headset. Great for recording and listening to music. Certainly one of the better general consumer headphones. If you're an audiophile however, you might want to look at a more expensive model by Shure, AT or Grado."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my new SRH440s today, and have had them on my head for about an hour. They are amazing. From sound quality (remember, this is WITHOUT burn in), to feel on my head to the feel in my hands, I feel as though they are the best headphones in their class, and reaching well above it.

I have listened to the same recordings (CD quality) on AKG 702s, and frankly, they sound about the same (a little stronger bass on the Shures) and the Shures feel a lot better on the head, and in the hand.

They are overall a very well built set of phones, and extremely comfortable on the head.

I picked them up for $88 plus shipping, whereas the AKGs were 3 times that.

A no brainer if you dont want to spend a ton of money, but still get a great product."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones sounds great (very good balanced, no so much bass neither treble), it has been my office`s companion for almost 4 years. Maybe the only complain until it worked was the weight, its a little heavy and no so much portable, thats why the main use of it in my case was at the office.
Well after 4 years using it in my office frequently it is broken without no reason, just the bolts of the right side was broken. Its a shame because these still sound great."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones produce very good and clear sound. I've been using them for playing games at night and unlike other gaming headsets I've tried, these do not produce excessive bass, just the right amount."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good and are pretty comfortable, but I've had two pairs break at the hinge after a year or more of normal use. I like them, but I probably won't buy a third pair."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is very much to my liking, a bit softer, not harsh. At the same time the headphones are clear and detailed. I am using them with the 840 series ear cushions. The cushions definitely improve comfort so that I can wear them for hours without any problems. I also don't have problems with the top of the headphones pressing against my head as others have also pointed out (though I do have a small head).

Some have also expressed concern about the lack of bass. To me they have just the right amount of bass. And it's tight, not boomy like the Sony XB500's. The 840 series pads also increase the amount of bass without making it too boomy.

I tried various popular Sony headphones before I bought these... XB500 & XB700 sounded too muddy in the mids and too boomy and loose in the bass. The MDR-V6 sounded a bit too harsh in the highs for my liking. The Shures are perfect.

Definitely buy the pads: [...]"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a huge fan of Shure. These are some great headphones for such a price. You definitely could not find anything better than this in the same price range. Shure obviously wins. As a bass guitarist I find the bass response pretty solid. Some headphones tend to over emphasize on its bass, which is sometimes too much and unbalances the music. This pair of headphones has a solid bass and a bright treble."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested the Sennheiser HD 429 side-by-side against the Shure SRH 440, and the Sennheiser won out, in my opinion. I wrote up the full review over on the Sennheiser HD 429 page, so check that out.

However, I will say that it was by no means a hands-down victory. I am not an audiophile, just a regular guy that listens to my iphone at work. For me, the sound quality was equal, with the Sennheisers delivering more bass. But you can easily adjust that by changing the equalizer setting on your iphone or ipod.

For me, the difference came down to 2 things: The Sennheisers were more comfortable and had better noise isolation.

Overall, though, I think both headphones were great, and you'll be happy with either set."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had two pair of these headphones, and although the sound is excellent, they break after a year of use. The break right at their joint with the Swivel and earphone cup. Note that both pairs broke just after the warranty period had expired. Where I like the sound, I am moving on to another manufacturer."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440s are a great sounding sturdy pair of headphones. The sound is overall a very bright but very clear. The highs and mids are emphasized over bass but the bass is definitely present without any muddling. They are good for watching movies and listening to music without the need of an added amplifier (of course using an amp improves the sound but its pretty solid without one). The 440s have pretty good imaging as well.

Pros:
Clear and Clean Sound
Price, good bang for your buck
Carrying case
1/4' adapter
Durability

Cons:
Little wire that sticks out to connect the right earcup (hope it doesn't catch something).
Weight. They are heavy and can get uncomfortable after extended use.
Ear cushions aren't the softest but they suffice.

Overall:
I highly recommend these and would buy them again in a heartbeat. They're a great pair of cans."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very clean and you can hear a lot of definition in the music. Also quality construction. I did read that some people didn't like the bass. However, when I play audio that has great bass, it sounds great in these headphones."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are comfortable for long hours of listening and adjust nicely to the head for a good fit(I have a small head). The sound quality is excellent with a good balance of frequencies from low to high. In listening to a CD of the Boston Pops I feel I'm sitting in the best seats of Symphony Hall. The quality of construction is excellent and appears to be a long lasting construction. I feel that for the price and quality this is an excellent purchase.
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for anyone who appreciates a wide variety of musical styles.

A note for casual listeners; these are flat mix headphones, which means they don't boost the bass like a lot of popular brands do. If you don't really care about the artist's version of how a song should sound, and just want something to blast your top40 garbage, these probably aren't the right headphones for you.

These are solid in construction and very durable. This is my second pair, my first lasted me about 3 years and only broke due to my carelessness. The sound quality is great, the range is great, and I find them quite comfortable. I have worn them for 6+ hours without getting a headache or sore ears."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all about these headphones and watched video reviews on the internet and tried to learn everything I could about the sound quality, value, comfort, and durability before I bought these. When I got them I was so excited to wear them, but as soon as I put them on, I hated them. Even with the excellent sound quality, you can't listen to them if you can't wear them comfortably. I strongly recommend going to a store where you can try them on before you wear them, because I could not stand the fact that the tips of my ears touched the inside cloth (which was supposed to protect your ears from sliding along the plastic interior and instead did nothing). I definitely have slightly bigger ears than the average person, but nothing even approaching ridiculously large. I sent these back immediately, and have learnt my lesson on trying something on before I order it."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two of these for two of my sons. They both wear them often, for long periods of time, without complaint, so they must be comfortable. Nothing has broken. I appreciate the replaceable cord, as I expect that the cord is the most likely part to fail. The sound quality is the best of any headphones I have used, but bear in mind that I have not used any high end audiophile headphones. Plenty of bang for the buck in this item."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones are amazing, they go very well with pretty much all types of music. The bass is there when it needs to, and the mids and highs are beautiful, even listening to movies or audiobooks, the clarity and depth in detail of what you are listening is incredible. It's made with really good materials and they are very comfortable. You won't regret buying this because it's totally worth the money. Is a perfect investment for people who really want to apreciate music the way musicians meant to."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones for their price. Can actually surpass many pricier ones. Just the band is way too stiff. The era pad crack in about eight months. The plastic will crack too with time where the ear pad connects to the band, but still it is quite sturdily built, you shan't be worried about breaking them if you drop the unconsciously on the floor. But the sound quality is qualitative: even, sturdy, frequency-proportionate sound."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted studio headphones that I could mix with in my home studio, and these were a perfect fit. They don't manipulate the sound one bit, so when you're mixing, what you hear is truly what you get. Mine are still working fine after all these years! Would definitely recommend these for any serious musicians wanting to get 0% manipulated sound for premium mixing."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is great for me, I use it mostly when listening to music and watching videos. The sound quality is awesome and I like that the cable is coiled to keep it from being all over the place.
Still the cable could be shorter and the headphones begin to hurt my ears after long periods of wearing them (about 3-4 hours).
overall great headphones."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, sound is great (as expected from all the reviews I found online). They're a bit heavy so I can feel the pressure on my head and ears after a while of wearing them but it's no big deal (this would have taken off half a star but Amazon won't let me do that). The heaviness also gives them a sturdy feel and they are padded which helps. They go all around my ears so they're truly closed and don't really allow sound to leak in or out too much. Since the cord comes off and they bend they are pretty portable. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good pair of headphones."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't complain, because for the price they sound just fine. The construction is less rugged than I would have expected from Shure, and even though the cable is removable, it's specific to this device. It would have been nice if it was a standard 1/8th inch connector on both ends, so if it breaks, I don't need to buy that specific cable from Shure.

The sound is a very flat response which is great, especially if you want to do mixing. However, it would be difficult to wear these for very extending mixing sessions because the head strap needs better padding.

All in all, I've always liked Shure products and this is no exception. In this price range it's a nice pair of headphones that would have no problem owning again."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome sound while playing my drums.

7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did a lot of research prior to dropping what seemed like a ton of money for a set of headphones. The Shure SRH440 has not disappointed. Amazing sound right out of the box...although the sound has improved after 25 hours or so of burn in. I don't think you could find a better sounding set of headphones in this price range ($93 delivered). Really like the ability to change the cable and ear pieces if necessary. They seem very durable. And they are very comfortable. I wore them the whole way on a flight from Honolulu to Chicago and they felt comfortable the whole way

My only knock would be that they are very large headphones. Not really a big deal for me, but may be for some.

Bottom line: If you are in the market for a great set of headphones for under $200, the Shure SRH440 should be on you short list. SIMPLY AMAZING!!"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"A great product. Just received headphones and burning them in as I type. Amazon delivery was impeccable as always and product got here 4 days ahead of schedule. I have big ears so I was very worried about comfort. I've tried Audio Technica M50's and they were way too heavy. The SRH440 is reasonably comfortable without having the headphones practically about to fall off your head. In terms of audio quality, the highs are a little lacking BUT this is right out of the box so that's a given. It's ok for general listening although I'd advise using an amp. The main reason I got these were to practice on my guitar without disturbing my roomies. No sound leakage thus far and does a good job isolating noise. Not exactly earplugs but it does block out most noise when something is playing."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did weeks of research trying to find perfect ""cans"". I finally decided on these over the Sony V6 and Sennheiser HD 280. I also considered the Grado line but went with closed, and Grados are open. These are my first quality pair of headphones so I don't have much to compare. I use them with my Macbook and iphone and they sounds great with both. The seem durable and that is the major reason I decided against the Bose around the ear headphones - too many people had complained about the durability, and these Shure's are like half the price.

I listen to mostly rock with some hip hop mixed in, and like I said, these headphones sound great. My friend who does some home studio work has the Sennheiser 280s and said these Shure's sounded good.

If you're having a hard time deciding which to get, just go with the best price and whatever you feel drawn to, because any pair that's at least $75 will sound good. Get what you think will make you happy. If you're interested in the Shure 440s, you won't be disappointed."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is absolutely amazing. However, I found the headband uncomfortable after about 3 hours.

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones almost 6 months ago and have loved them since I took them out of the box. The price has gone up some since I purchased them but when I bought them they were a steal at about $70.

The quality is on par with other higher priced headphones I have tried out at stores, and although they don't have electronic noise-cancelling, they do a GREAT job of physically isolating you from other sounds. I simply cannot hear anyone that is trying to talk to me with them on, and I don't consider myself as someone who ""Blasts"" their music.

The build quality could be a little nicer, but I guess that is where the the bargain price shows itself. However, they have proved to be very durable and fold up nicely into the included carrying bag.

Overall I am VERY satisfied with these cans and would recommend them to anyone."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phones for laying tracks without audio bleed into the mic. I wish the cord was longer and straight. The coil is good for some things but I prefer straight. I do plan to get another pair soon.

7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these headphones to practice guitar without disturbing the rest of the family.

The product is great in terms of quality, construction, sound, presentation, etc. It trends to be a big heavy but this is, at the end, one of the best characteristics as the construction as it's very solid and nice.

Happy customer; happy famliy."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great!!!

I was looking for a good pair of headphones for a while now. After doing much research on the various Skull Candy and Beats models, I found a recommendation to check these out. First I must say that there is a reason that this model had only 4 and 5 star reviews. These are excellent! They sound great with music and videos. I listen to mostly R&B, Raggae and Rap and they performed fantastic with all Genres! An added plus to these is the ability to block exterior noise. They were not advertised as noise cancelling but they do a great job at it. I really cant even hear myself talk. The price was also a great selling point.

If your looking for a pair of good all around headphones, these are them! I am hooked!!!"
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great studio headphones. Good flat response. Flat is good people. Especially if you are mixing and recording. If you want something that boosts the highs and low and makes everything sound like a pop hip hop record don't buy these.
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"So originally I had picked up a paid of Sennheiser HD 280 pros. I used it for work as I was working on audio and video. That head set sounded great at the time.

Now I'm at a new job but I wanted to bring my HD 280's to work so that I can listen to music and work at the same time. This meant I had to buy a new pair for home usage.

So I picked up the SRH440's. After reading reviews, I decided what could I lose.

It finally came in and I immediately plugged it in to my computer and started listening to tunes. I have to say, this headset is ULTRA CLEAR, it doesn't have the bass of the HD280's but that's okay, the clarity on these headphones rock!

If you're looking for a good headset for a rather reasonable price, you can't go wrong with this!"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Title says it all.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great and are very well made. The cord is awesome they look great. Only problem is it hurts the top of my head after about 15 minutes. But this might just be my problem, I have a pointy head."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are a great deal. They are professional quality and I'm very happy with them.

awful ear foam, maybe usable on a child sized skull.
you HAVE to replace the ear foam unless you want red, sore ears."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these with my Roland drum kit. They produce a great sound and are very comfortable.
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound kicks in and out, sometimes all sound is in the left headphone, sometimes all sound is on the right. I am constantly having to twist the headphone jack to get even sound in both ears, with any source. I have to twist the jack when listenin to my iPhone, when listening through my PC or docking station at work, and when listening on my personal laptop at home. This has been a problem for over a year now, incredibly disappointed in these headphones.

UPDATE
thanks to the removable cord, I was able to switch it out for a replacement also from Shure and also purchased on Amazon. I chose the non-coiled version, it cost under $20 and now these headphones work again! Wish I had thought of that sooner, also wish the original purchase any so fragile. I'm not putting any strain on these headphones so there's no reason the cord it came with bends to the point of unusablility in less than 6 MONTHS. Anyway, rating has been updated from 1 to 3 stars."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these phones. Comfortable and top-of-the-line construction.
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed an upgrade to my old headphones that (admittedly) I got at a garage sale. Nice full size headphones but the cable was getting damaged and had that annoying volume control feature. I think its cool but at the same time stupid because I find it the first thing to go. I fought with them for a while until I finally had it. So I went looking for an upgrade that would cater closely to what I'm doing more nowadays, that is home/studio listening for enjoyment and music production. I live in a rather noisy area where I hear the fire trucks and ambulances coming and going regularly and among other things. So I needed a pair of closed-back headphones for isolation as I find the sound reproduction of noise canceling headphones to not be as accurate and nowhere near this price range. I also wanted a set that offered the replaceable cable and ear cups option as decent headphones can last a long time but these two parts always wear out before decent drivers do. Amazingly enough I discovered the Shure SRH 440's. I got everything I was looking for. These are really nice headphones for what they're designed for (e.g. home/studio listening). These might not appeal to people used to higher end equipment but as a start into the world of detail and sound resolution it's wonderful for the price.

There are drawbacks that I feel some people miss about these. These don't have much bass impact (e.g. you don't really feel an explosion so much as hear it.) The sound signature is a rich neutral (e.g. it strives for balance and clarity, middle of the road). They are not really made to be run by Iphones and Ipods. These guys need a little more power to drive them to their full abilities with a headphone amplifier. They sound good unamped but sound their best amped. One other thing is these sound particularly tight and bright out of the box. There's nothing wrong with them because they need to be ""broken-in."" Some people like the sound from the get go, but for me it took a little getting used to. Over time the drivers have been slowly relaxing and loosening up making it sound even better with time. If your looking for nice pair of headphones that will last and deliver great sound, these are a nice choice at this price bracket.

PROS
+ Marvelous sound that is balanced and clear. - Even at really low volumes (while amped) I can still hear amazing detail.
+ Great isolation. - I don't hear the traffic anymore with these on and I'm not cranking these. I listen at very moderate levels.
+ Removable cable for cable replacement. (Or to change to a higher grade audio cable)
+ Solid build. Can fold up for easy transport and storage.
+ Gold-plated Plugs (For signal efficiency.) 3.5MM with a screw on 1/4 plug.
+ Full-size over the ear cups.

CONS
- Shallow cushions - The rim of my ear rests against the drivers. Depending on position can become uncomfortable.
- Shallow Headband cushion - There is some cushioning but mostly to cover up the inside parts.
For me it gets a little uncomfortable in certain positions but once I find the spot I'm content.

As these aren't powerhouse audiophile headphones, they don't require a serious amplifier to run them.
If your a budding audiophile, spend a little more on your headphone amp and you'll be happier for it.

My experience (if you wish to know)

Putting these on and turning on the music is like being transported. I found myself relishing music even more through these as I began to hear it in a whole new way. I enjoy all kinds of music from Metal, Classical, Folk, World, Electronic and Alternative. When I put on Vivaldi: Four Seasons (FLAC format), I couldn't believe my ears. The clarity and beauty of this music resonated out of drivers with such detail. The descents and ascents of the lows to highs and back were a treat. String instruments sound incredible in these as well (Violin, Acoustic Guitar, Cello). One thing is you'll notice the quality of your music more. You'll hear the effects of the poor sound reproduction in the higher compression formats. However, you'll also notice other parts of the music that cheaper headphones can't reproduce when listening to CD's. Some music will be more appealing in these than others. Mostly music that relies more on its musical detail (Classical, New Age, Flamenco) than impact."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality that these headphones can produce is great. When plugged into a computer, TV, iPod, or receiver, they sound excellent. The full ear cups can cancel out a lot of surrounding noise, but not all since they aren't noise-canceling. I'm a little disappointed at how they sound plugged into my Peavey amp. The main reason I ordered these was because I live in an apartment and wanted to be able to play my electric guitar later at night without disturbing the neighbors. Unfortunately, the sound that the amp speaker produces is far better than the sound quality of the headphones when plugged into the amp, and it's not an expensive amp or speaker in it. All the tones sound a lot muddier and muffled with the headphones in the amp. Then again it could just be the amp..."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is nice and balanced. The mids and highs are clear even in higher volume levels. These headphones are not for people who like a lot of bass in their music. It's very balanced, but full. The cable is about 4 and a half feet long coiled.
I bought these for $68.95 which are the best headphones in that price range. The higher price nowadays makes these a deal breaker since the materials aren't durable.

4 year UPDATE: The fake leather that is used on the head band began to come off. It became very brittle after a while and the smallest scrape would tear it. As for the sound, it is still as great as ever which is fantastic. Unfortunately, I end up with a bunch of leather droppings on my head after I use them so they are probably going to the trash. I have now switched my 5 star rating to a 3. Don't expect them to last forever!

Update2: I purchased another pair and about a year later, the leather around the headband is beginning to crack as well. Terrible."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first saw these phones in a magazine a couple of month's ago, did some research, and finally made my decision. And wow! Just got them today, and I am in awe. I'm rocking out with them right now. Build quality, sound, comfort... for the price, these cans are beyond my expectations. If you're looking some great phones, get this guy!

My only gripe is the cable. Some great big coiled thing, doesn't seem quite ideal to rock while on the move (at school, while walking, etc. Can't really tuck them under my shirt).
And the sound quality is so good I can hear all the flaws in my low quality music copies. Looks like I'll have to buy my music now... :-(

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The SRH440 Headphones are middle of the road quality. I expected a higher, audio quality. With technology improvements in fidelity equipment today, and, especially with Shure, I was expecting more from these headphones. These headphones are OK, but, if you are seeking a higher quality set, you will need to try Beyer Dynamics, for example."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat heavy, not to burdensome for a 16yr old kid. Sound quality is good, definitly worth the $67 I paid. Not very bass heavy for those who love Bass, but to me they feel just right.

External
Ear pads are extremely comfortable and they rotat just in case it gets sweaty.
The top of the headset is some sort of leather and feels like a pillow.
The plastic is high quality plastic and it does not wobble alot
It folds and fits into a nice leather suede case, but it is not a type of headphone where you can just toss it into a backpack and expect it to work.
these headphones are best suitable at home when your sitting and wantign to listen to music

Good"
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,4 years later they may sound better than they did when I purchased these
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well the most important part about any set of headphones is the overall sound. And Shure hit the nail on the head in that regard. With deep bass, that actually sounds like bass notes and is not booming, clear mids and highs the sound of these phones is superb! The only reason i did not give them 5 stars is because of their bulky design and weight as their a bit heavy. However they are quite comfortable. For about a 100 bucks you really can't go wrong, especially if ""sound"" is your first priority. I would definately recomend these to anyone who really loves music, and wants high end audiofile sound at a reasonable price."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very listenable, reasonably-priced headphones. I own these and, a Grado SR80i, and Sennheiser HD600 headphones. These are connected to a Nuforce Icon-uDAC2 headphone amp. In comparison with the similarly-priced Grado cans, the SRH440 are a sealed back design. The cable for the Shures has a coiled end and can be replaced. The Grados have a straight cable.
You won't hear much outside the Shures even at the lowest volume levels. This allows office mates to sneak up on you and the phone just disappears. Also, folks outside can't hear much from your listening with the Shures unless you have the volume up THAT LOUD. Both the Shures and the Grados will play THAT LOUD (but you shouldn't do that to yourself if you plan to keep your hearing).
Both headphones are comfortable. I found the Shures have the edge with very plush pleather ear pads. In fact, the Grados can actually be somewhat uncomfortable with glasses on. The Shures give me ""headphone hair"" like no other headphone I have.
Both headphones sound fantastic. I can't imagine regretting purchasing either pair. And, while your experience will vary, I found the bass on the Shures to be preferable, the upper midrange on the Grados was smoother. The Shures have a flashy presentation compared to the Grados and their balanced sound. I have compared both to the HD600. The Grados are closer to the Sennheisers. So close, as a matter of fact, that it's kinda difficult to justify the extra cash of the Sennheisers.
So, if you're looking for a pair of headphones for around $100, these are both excellent choices. The Shure SRH440 will give you isolation, comfort, and lively sound. The sound of the Grado SR80i is so smooth one could listen to them all day."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a long time fan of the MDR-V6, but after a pair were stolen at school, I decided to mix it up because these were available for $76. I love these headphones. They have a much better sound stage than the V6s and I feel like the highs are a bit crisper. The detachable cable is amazing too. These headphones will likely replace the V6/7506 as the go to sub $150 headphones. They definately live up to Shure's name and are like to SM57 of headphones."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband, and he absolutely loves these headphones. He says they're the best ever!"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sound you could ask for in headphones. Crisp and clean. Lows/Mids/High all come through perfectly in harmony. Vocals are superb. Bass is strong but not overpowering as you may find in Beats; no wash out. Highly recommended
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound. These sound better than any headphones you will find at the mall, or Best Buy. Better sound than and Beats, even though the Beat are so much more expensive.

The clarity of highs is amazing, and the bass is perfect, not over bearing. I would only say that if you want Bass monsters, these are not it. If you want clean Bass and perfect everything else, these are it.

The only negatives are, the cord it a spiral type, and is very big and heavy. To many people this is actually a plus.
Also they are not the most comfortable, not much padding on the band. These are only good for about an hour, before they start getting uncomfortable on the top of your head. But the price and sound make it worth it. I personally do not listen to music much for more than an hour."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, very comfortable. Reasonably priced for the build quality and sound quality."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, okay, not really. The reduce the auditory effect of those chattering around the wearer.

I had to get some sound reducing headphones because there's more chatter around my work cube than there used to be. The headphones by themselves provide some sound reduction. When playing music, I slip into my own little world.

Cons: Both the headphones and the cord are somewhat heavy."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love Shure. This is the second pair of headphones that I have purchased from them (I have E2-C earbuds), and I love both the quality of the products, and the great customer service supplied by Shure (two year warrenty, etc.). I am absolutely hooked, and I will only be purchasing headphones from Shure in the future.

These headphones sound fantastic, are very sturdy, and very affordable for higher end headphones. My only complaint is that the stock ear cushions are a little bit small, and I would recommend purchasing the SRH840 replacement ear cushions and using those instead."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although lacking a bit in comfort, these headphones are quite nice.
They present music the way it was recorded. They do not emphasize bass or treble, but try to be as accurate as possible.
After a few hours of wear, they will begin to get a bit uncomfortable, but that is easily aided by shifting them around a bit.
They seem like they are built to last, but the small wires on the sides of the cups could prove to be a problem if they get snagged on something, but I have fixed this with a bit of electrical tape to hold them down.
All in all, I quite like these headphones and I would recommend them."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was willing to spend $250 on AIAIAI's TMA-1 Studio headphones until I read relatively negative reviews on them, which lead me to the Shure SRH-440s and I'm really glad they did.

1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sure SRH440 studio headphones is a great buy, but has some limitations I think you should keep in mind. The build quality overall is great, the plastic seems solid and the look is second to none. There are some flaws though. My one problem I had with my last pair of studio headphones (Sony) was that the leather padding on the head-strap began molting and eventually began to show the foam underneath (which took about a year or so). They were great headphones though, and apart from that they were everything and more of what I paid for them ($100). This is a similar situation. The leather on the ear-cup is starting to wear through on the crease between the leather ear-cup and the plastic housing. I've only had these headphones for a month or two and this is happening. Thankfully, Shure offers a full plethora of accessories for all their audio products. All I have to do is replace it. I just wish I didn't have to do that.

The sound is great, but not impressive. For the price point, you get a good product and one you will most likely have for years if you don't mind the wear and tear on the leather parts. It's honestly hard to find a headphone that offers super precise sound nowadays unless you are willing to pay $300. My guess is that a lot of headphone manufacturers save their best magnets for the upper tier models. So, as far as I'm concerned this is a decent and safe value."

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of 240's before, they were amazing. But after purchasing the 440's, I have fallen in love. These headphones are durable and comfortable. At first, they may feel slightly bulky, or too hot when wearing for extended periods, but they are a great set of headphones. They function at the same level, if not better, then most 200$ headphones. These are a must buy. I do not prefer the coiled cord though."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound phenomenal. The construction is sturdy also and the pads are comfortable. I like the fact the cord is detachable also. The sound quality is amazing (especially for under $100). The only thing on these cans is that the pad is not really thick so if you have ears that stick out a bit they will touch the inside. The pad is replaceable also, but I wish they made different thickness pads to customize the fit a bit. Maybe they will since these are really new."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"An impressive pair of headphones, I bought them from Amazon after a long research and consideration, and I wasn't at all disappointed, especially after I bought an Asus D1 Sound card to go with it. Sound quality is perfect and you can hear new depths and details in Music when used with a good sound card. This combination of Headphones/sound card gives perfect sound with Classical Music, which is the only kind of music I listen to."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for the price. They adjust easily from my small head to my husband's giant head. We use them for recording music. I would highly recommend them for someone dipping their toes into recording equipment.
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones in sub-$100 price range, hands down. Sound quality is just awesome, frequency response is excellent - no artificially lifted bass, just the right amount, at the same time crisp and clear mids and highs, no audible distortions whatsoever. Sound remains excellent in a wide dynamic range as well - both at low and high volume settings. I applaud Shure for the excellent job they've done, I don't think anything of this quality was ever available in this price range. So go ahead, do your research, or, better yet, drive to your local favorite music/electronics store and ask for a demo. Most likely you'll end up buying these just like me. I even like these better compared to the ""big brother"" SRH 840 - I see no significant difference in the sound quality to justify the steep price increase. Don't bother, though, if all you do is listening to MP3 recordings - you'll be disappointed to discover how poor the quality of MP3 actually is. On the other hand, any lossless format, CD or DVD quality music will be pure joy to listen to. Jazz, classical, rock, metal, you name it - all sound great, every instrument and voice comes alive (disclaimer - never tried hip-hop/rap - not a big fan). I'm sure these phones will work just fine in a studio environment too."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones look pretty nice (although that hardly matters), and have a great sound-- I'm not much of an audiophile so couldn't tell you any specific advantages over most other headphones, but they're definitely the most solid of the recent headphones I've had.

I have only one complaint, and that's that they start to hurt my head and ears after not too long. But readjusting them usually makes that go away for a little while, and I only use these headphones with my desktop computer and at home (I use earbuds for traveling), so that's all right.

The sound quality is great. I am not a sound expert so I will let the others who know more work out the details. For me, all the music I've been listening to is very clear. You don't need to turn high volume yet you will be able to hear most parts a song has to offer.

The build is top-notch. Very sturdy. The material is definitely not cheap ones. I have been using it for a month or so with everyday use yet it stays like brand new. The coiled cable is such a great idea. I could get out of my desk and grab a drink in the fridge nearby with no music interruption. Furthermore, the headphone can be folded so it's easy to store to the pouch that comes with the headphone. Great design!

The last and the most important thing is comfort. Unfortunately the default cushion does not meet my expectation. The cushions start to squeeze my ears after an hour or so and it starts to feel really uncomfortable. Luckily, the replacement (http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC440-Replacement-Cushions-Headphones/dp/B002Z9JWZI/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1367854644&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=shure+srh440+ear+cushion) works out REALLY well. They look exactly the same and but the replacement cushions do not give me any discomfort after long session of wearing. Furthermore, they seem to block outside noise better so I can hear my music even better! I do not understand why Shure does not use the replacement cushions as the default ones. It would have been a five star if they do.

Overall, great buy. I would really recommend you to buy the replacement cushions right away if you decide to buy the headphone though."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"With anythin, there are pros and cons, So let's start with pros:

-Sound quality is amazing. Crisp highs, clear mids, and rich lows. Very well balanced.
- Solid construction of the outer shell and ear cups
- Love the ability to replace the cord by removing it from the headset!
- No problems with fit. Very comfortable. I used them about 6-9hrs daily and never have an issue. I read that others complain about ""head squeeze"" but I am betting that they have not properly adjusted the sides accordingly. Not only can you adjust the length of the sides, but the cups rotate slightly as well to fit nicely around your ears.
- Sound does NOT escape the earcups when on your head- fantastic for office use!

Now the cons:
- The only thing that is an issue is the weight of the cord. Like the fact that the long cord is coiled, but it is a slight nuisance.
- Not much here in the style department. Not flashy. Very function-driven. I would wear these walkind down the street or anything... That said, I had to find something to complain about here.

You have found these headphones because you are looking for something BETTER. Clarity and definition are important to you- as well it SHOULD be. Highly recommend these headphones to anyone wanting an audiophile-quality headset without paying $250."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying these cans, I was using a pair of Sony MDR-V6's for about a year. I loved them, and still do somewhat, but they were lacking quality on vocals especially and had overly bright highs. I got these to try to alleviate those problems.

They sound excellent in general, but I'll go over the different ranges real fast:

Highs: Very crisp and true, although with a very select few songs (most noticeable with Not Afraid by Eminem) they can be shocking and fatiguing. Honestly, it shouldn't be a problem at all for most people and I could potentially just blame my sound card for driving high highs.

Mids: I don't notice as much in general with mids, but they're fine. Vocals are clean and beautiful.

Lows/Bass: These headphones are not meant for bassheads who basically want jackhammers duct taped to their eardrums, but they definitely can push out some clean and loud bass. I noticed that the bass increased a LOT after burn in. It was fairly quiet to begin with but after something like 20 hours of playing music the bass really came out and impressed me.

When I ordered these they were about $69, which is incredible value for 'phones of this caliber. All I can say is that any entry to mid level audiophiles should enjoy the headphones after the burn in and normal people will hear them as godly. The impedance isn't that high so portable players can drive them, and where other people complained about comfort, they're actually NOT bad. It might just be me, but these are actually quite comfortable as is. I might invest in the SRH-840's earpads just to increase bass, but I can easily wear these for long periods of time without a problem. Sometimes they'll push my glasses a bit forward but again it's not bad at all.

I totally recommend these for listening to music. Maybe not for monitoring, but definitely for music. Order them and enjoy them!"
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Working in film, television, and news production these are a great asset. They have great manipulability, great sound, and solid cabling. That being said, they may not be best suited for extended-use, as they can get very heavy and don't have as comfortable earmuffs as say, some Beats headphones. However, in terms of fit, they do have a great advantage of width and length which almost forces me to wear them casually over Beats."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my new Shure 440's. The first thing I noticed is that there's no flimsy little wire sticking out of the ear piece, to which one connects the longer cable to the device (iPod or laptop). I've gone through two Bose OE (on ear) headphones over the past 2 years at $150 a pop. On both sets, that little connecting wire went bad. I'll never waste my money again on Bose!

These appear to be much better built. The cable plugs right into the ear piece; with no wimpy little wire to go bad. The 440's sound great, which is the most important thing. Of course there is more sound control when listening to a laptop (MacBook Pro), as the equalizer can be adjusted to suit your wishes. However, they also sound great with my iPod. I've read that they can become uncomfortable with longer use. I'll have to wait and see. If that's an issue, I'll just get the pads (for the Shure 880) recommend by others on this site. They're about $19.

I have to confess, I thought these were ""on ear"" not ""over the ear"". I suspect they might get a bit warm in the warmer months. Since we don't have too many of those in Maine, I guess I can get used to it. I'm sitting right next to a telephone, that was answered by my wife. I didn't hear it ring, so they block out quit a bit of background noise. These sound every bit as good as the Bose OE's that they have replaced. I like to listen to all sorts of music, and these will make it sound great for a long time, I'm sure!"
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from a pair of Etymotic 4R-S earphones I was impressed with the sound quality of these headphones that are 1/3 of the price. Mids and highs aren't quite as distinct but they do deliver stronger bass. Good enough sound for me.

They fit pretty well but will make my ears sore after a half hour if they're not positioned quite right. However I've experienced the same thing with other headphones so this isn't the fault of the Shures. They do a nice job of sealing out the outside world, too. Again not as good as my Etymotics but that is to be expected as the Etys are an in-ear-canal product.

The only thing that I'm not happy with is the cord. It's of good quality so it's heavy and thick. But because the coiled section is a good 18"" long it's very heavy in that spot and tends to fall off your lap, pulling whatever device it's connected to with it. At some point I will likely replace the cord or solder the bayonet end onto a different piece.

Overall though I'm happy with my purchase."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned this pair of headphone, for over four years maybe? I 'm not sure, but it was a long time ago. They still sound great. I've never had issues with them, however, they are not too confortable for extended periods of use. I also use glasses and after a long time of wear, they begin to get painful.
The sound quality is great in my opinion. It's very clear and balanced. I'm bit of a basshead so I wish they had a deeper pumpier(?) bass, but I've never once regretted my purchase.
They have heavy sings of wear. The faux leather on the headband has chipped off a lot, but then again I've had them for a while and constantly use them. The ear cups are still in goodshape, no chipping of any kind.
I would recommend this pair of headphone, but do be aware that they are quite heavy and get painful after hours of use."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one pair of these, which I loved. Audio quality was fine (I'm no audiophile, but the isolation seemed good and I had no complaints with bass levels). More importantly, they were comfortable, easy to slip on and off, and the coiled cord stayed out of my way. When the plastic headband broke after less than a year, I was annoyed, and ordered a different brand. But I hated the other brand's usability so much by comparison that I wound up ordering another pair of SRH440s.

Here we are again, after less than a year, and my second pair of SRH440s has broken in the exact same spot. (And no, I'm not being rough with them.)

So ask yourself: do you want a pair of headphones that works like a dream, even if you know you'll be replacing them in less than a year?"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through the various iPod on/in-ear designs and I've tried the noise reduction large style headphones. I was a Koss PRO 4A fan in the old days and always wanted something that could bring back the quality of those old Koss headphones. Well, I found it. The Shure SRH440's are about as close as I think possible to my goal and I am very happy with the sound quality that I am getting from them. I can hear things in my music (jazz) that really improves my listening experience. Even using a flat setting on my equilizer the sound is great. But for my ears I've tweeked the settings to improve things for me. The headphones appear well built, but I have not had them that long (two months). The ear pads are not as soft as I would like, but hey now I'm getting picky. I would suggest getting the additional straight cord that runs from the headphones to your music device (the headphones come with a coiled cord) depending on where your using the headphones you may prefer to switch cords. Bottomline...if you want great sound and are interested in an over the ear, closed-back headphones at a good price...I would suggest you check these out."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have that headset for almost a year now. Here are a few of the pros and cons:

Pros:
Great sound, very clean and precise, very well balanced.
Fits my head very well (I have a large sized head and the headphones can fit even a larger head easily)
Great overall choice for a reasonable price.
Detachable cable.

Cons:
No option to rotate one of the headphones outwards like in other studio sets.
Gets a little warm around the ears after a while of using it (but what over-the-ear headphone doesn't?)"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great set. You can hear every instrument. Not too thumpy, but you get what the artist is trying to give you."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound.
Bass almost nonexistent, as everyone else says.
Ideally to be used with amp(~50-100$) like FiiO to get good bass.
After about 1-2 hours you'll be left with soar ears, you can switch pads or add some tissue beneath to make it softer, the sound is worth it as far as I'm concerned."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep it short.

If you need something for recording / mixing and want entry-level headphones with great sound isolation, and extremely balanced lows, mids, and highs, then get this. For the price, they're incredible.

If you're planning on wearing these for extended periods of time, then these will get a tad bit uncomfortable. Not the ear portion, but rather the top of the head.

Either way, I love mine. For Shure."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was researching headphones for the last couple of months, and to be honest, I was looking at either these or the Studio Beats by Dre. I couldn't bring myself to pay $300 for those headphones, even thought the bass on them is epic. These Shure's are my first foray into ""real"" audio equipment, and I am not disappointed in any aspects. My music sounds so different, and I was shocked when I went back to my $20 earphones. It was literally day and night in difference. I love these headphones, the only bad part would be that they can get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Regardless, these are definitely worth the ~$70 I paid for them."

0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the SRH240 to the SRH440 and I am happy I did. I was completely content with the 240's, but me being the electronic freak that I am... I had to spring for the more expensive model. The 440's definitely feel more ""studio-ish"" when it comes to weight and sound quality, and the wound cord and detachable option was smart on Shures part. I was in Best Buy the other day listening to the Beatz by Dre. and the Bose on-ear headphones... and I would take my $79.99 Amazon SRH440's over them any day, plus they look better! Two Thumbs up on not just the 440's, but Shure in general."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've spent $100 on several headsets, and this one is by far the most clear, comfortable, and loud! I'm so happy with it I take it everywhere! You will not be disappointed."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good from these, definitely above average for something in this price range.

However, wearing these for longer than even just 5 minutes makes my head hurt like hell. They must have never tried wearing the headset before deciding to produce it. I'm having to wear a hoodie with these so my head doesn't hurt. Definitely considering returning these."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. I use them at work, and even when no one is around and I have the opportunity to use the computer speakers, I often choose to use the headphones anyway because the sound quality is so much better. I have only had them a few weeks, but the headphones seem to be a good quality and I expect them to hold up for a long time. My ears tend to tire of them after a few hours, but that could be due partly to my wearing glasses. Once again, another great Shure product."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, just treat them nicely and they'll do the same. Definitely the best headset I've had the pleasure of listening to. Went to Bestbuy to compare headphone quality and pricing and this by far crushed nearly everything they had to offer. Everything there just felt cheap and flimsy."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were my first high-end headphones and I must say they do not disappoint. The sound is wonderfully balanced and neutral. I admit that bass is a bit weak, however it makes up for that in its accuracy, which could be preferred by some.
My only problems are that it is a bit bulky compared to other neutral headphones in its price range. Also to get the best comfort, you absolutely need the 840 earpads, but once you get them they are incredibly comfortable."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"In warm weather, my ears perspire when wearing this headphones for long periods. The coil phone cord is heavy therefore tends to make my head tilt.
For the headphone cord: this should be a linear wire and maybe coiled about 4 feet away from the headphone.
The headphone should provide different material ear padding that are breathable as an accessory."

9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"PRE ORDER
Mission:
I bought these looking for a replacement for another pair of headphones for monitoring purposes.

Attractions:
The first thing that attracted me to the Shures was the claim of flat response obviously intended for the professional studio (as labeled). The second thing that attracted me to these headphones was the low price. Another thing that REALLY attracted me to these was the REMOVABLE locking cable. I've had trouble with previous headphone jacks that ended up with me having to go buy a new jack and stripping the cable to solder it on, so it seemed like a pretty sweet feature to save future trouble.

Picking the Right Set of Cans:
I was doing some research on good studio oriented headphones below(or at) the $100 price point. I came up finding these(Shure SRH440), the Sennheiser HD280 Pros, and the Sony MDR-v6's and/or 7506's. And obviously I came to choosing these.

POST ORDER

First Impressions:
I had watched a few unboxing and review videos of the Shures just to see what I'd be getting, so nothing out of the box VISUALLY surprised me as I had seen it all already, but when I took them out of the plastic bag and actually held them in my hand myself, I was lovestruck. They are nice and heavy(in a good way) and VERY solidly built.

Build:
Like I said before, these are quite hefty in weight, but also in size. (Which I like a lot, but for those looking for smaller, lighter cans, I don't think this is where you want to go) The plastics used on the headphones are very solid and of high quality. I guess I had taken the build of the previous set of headphones I was using as fair, so when I just grabbed the earcups and pulled them apart I was blown away with just how well these things were made.
The headband is made of some flexible material covered in a synthetic leatherette, and feels sturdy yet moldable. It sits nicely atop the head.
From what gathered from the few moments the stock earPADS were one the headphones before I took them off to replace them with some upgraded SRH840 pads I had bought at the same time as these, they were okay in quality. A tad stiff though.
The cable is a nice, thick coiled one around 10 feet long that starts up on a SINGLE side of the headphones rather than a Y-cable, and terminates to a 3.5 mm/ 1/8 in gold plated jack.
The jack itself has a threaded end to screw on the included 1/4 in (whatever the equivalent is in millimeters) adapter. The rubber/plastic on the end of it has a nice grippy part to it that makes it easy to hold and plug in to whatever you need to. A small detail, but I found it quite nice.

Comfort:
Like I said a short ways up in the previous paragraph, I bought a set of replacement earpads that normally go on the big brother of this product, the SRH840, on suggestions of other peoples experiences with these headphones. I tried them on with the stock pads before I swapped them and like people said, the pads were fairly stiff and shallow. Immediately thereafter I put on the other pads. They were thicker, softer, and more comfortable. The most noticeably difference I would have to say though is the padding on the INSIDE of the pads that cover the driver. It is much thicker and of better quality. So during long wearing sessions I can see these being much more bearable. I've also heard claims of the pads improving sound quality, but I didn't actually listen to them before I swapped the pads so I can't confirm them. ** I also have pretty prominent(sticky-outy) ears that usually become discomforted quite soon after putting on headphones, but these are (now anyways) deep enough with thick enough inner padding that it's not much of a problem.
The headband is quite ""cushy"" and forms rather nicely to the head. But sometims, when wearing them for a long time, the top of my head begins to get sore where it rests upon my head.
These headphones are actually pretty tight gripping on my (seemingly) normal sized head. I like that A LOT, but I'm sure it bothers the hell of some people. I've heard people calling them loose, but they aren't to me.

Overall, they feel very nice to me sitting on my head.

Now with what was my greatest fear about ordering headphones,

Sound/Sound Quality:
I have previously listened to studio oriented headphone and they seemed ""canny"" and fit the closed back headphone STEREOtype(pun), and I hate having to wait unnecessarily for things, so I was afraid of ordering these before actually listening to them under the cause that they would sound crappy. I'll tell you right now, my fears were misplaced. The SRH440's sounded pretty darn good on the first listen. I still haven't burnt them in the full 100 or so hours suggested by many, but they sound great already. The highs are nice and crisp, the mids are warm and smooth, and the bass is lush and extended. I am currently playing pink noise and assorted sounds through them, and after a few of days(with breaks, don't worry) hey, maybe they'll sound even better.
As far as isolation of outside noise goes, the Shures do it quite well. I'll give you an example of how well they do it:I've had really loud music been playing through speakers in the other room, and I put these on as earmuffs to block out the sound. Obviously it didn't completely shut out the sound, but made it quiet enough that it wasn't unbearable to hear.
The soundstage with these is actually pretty wide and spacey. Things panned hard left or right sound more spread apart than other closed back headphones. Now I haven't heard a lot to compare to them (especially not open backed/open-air headphones which are supposed to have the broadest soundstage), but these headphones give me such an awesome stereo image when listening to music.

If I had to describe these headphones in two words, it would be these:
SUPERIOR VALUE.

Well there's my two cents. Haha, I hope I didn't miss anything.
Awesome headphones."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds beautiful. Would give 5 stars except the ear cups come off a little too easily and are quite tricky to out back on. Otherwise, excellent value"

2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality but fragile. [Keeps it from being 150$]
Comparable to sennheiser & M-audio."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that I have very good ears and usually am able to hear all the nuances in music quality. Currently I own Sennheiser HD428, Sennheiser CX500, and couple other cheaper earbuds.

These headphones have one flaw and that is comfort(although your opinion might be different). I strongly recommend upgrading to Shure SRH840 earpads. Stock ones are too hard and provide no padding between the ear and speaker plastic, which results in pain after about 15 mins of use. New pads completely solved the problem for me.

The sound coming out of these is very good. Instrumental separation is very good considering their price. Bass is not boomy at all, it is tight and controlled but might not satisfy bass heads. Midrange is pretty neutral and highs are very bright, almost too much with certain music. However, SRH849 earpads tuned down the highs slightly and they are perfect now. They also enhanced the bass slightly. These headphones slice apart frequencies like high presicion surgical equipment. Very detailed sound. I am very happy about that.

My sennheisers HD428 sound little less precise and overall sound is more laid back. I like both headphones but overall prefer Shure a bit more.

Overall these are amazing value and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice sounding set of headphones."

6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones but a little crispy on the high end. I work in the audio industry and have been using these for mixing for a couple of years now. I've used them for mixing recording and for live use.

7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially chose these over the Bose AE2's because these advertised a much flatter response, and the sound was great. However, after 15 or 20 minutes of wearing these lead behemoths, muscles in my head that I didn't know I had would start to ache. I don't know if it's because my head is oddly shaped, or my ears are too big, but what good is good sound reproduction if you can't enjoy it for more than a few songs at a time? Also, I know it's meant for studio recording, but the cable that comes with these phones is way too thick, and heavy. The coiled up pulls on your head if you are anywhere near the danger of pulling the chord out of it's socket, but if you're trying to use that extra length, the constant tugging is really annoying, I'd much rather have the straight chord."

I've been using them pretty much none stop since Jan 2012 and they're still great. These are definitely quality build. Highly recommend for anyone that cares about great sound.
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these specifically to use with me Line6 HD500 guitar effects unit.. I honestly think these headphones sound better than my $1200 amp and cab set up... Couldn't be happier with my purchase!
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,two months and i have already lost audio in an ear
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent headphones
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! Good quality, comfortable!"
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my husband. He says he really loves them and the sound quality is great. He would recommend
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality and great sound
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried three different headphones:

Sennheiser 280 Pro
Sound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way to tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.

Audio Technica ath-m30
The sound on these was mediocre, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.

Shure SRH440
I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are supremely excellent. Comfortable, amazingly good sounding, durable, and good looking to boot. I'm listening to them right now, in fact, as I have been nearly 8 hours a day for the past month. I listen to music pretty much any time I'm not walking around or driving, which is why a good quality pair of headphones was essential to me. The Shures fit the bill perfectly. Clear mids and highs, with punchy real-feeling bass. For this price they're amazing."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I ever had.
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"They do not feel that heavy nor do they bother my ears. I do, however, take of any earring before wearing these for an extended period of time."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones - I have never had a pair that sounded so good. They are comfortable and seem to be very well made. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to record music - or just likes to listen.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as studio monitors and for playing my digital piano. Soundstage is pretty good, perhaps could be livelier and mid range can sometimes sound muffled, but overall great for a studio monitor. Only problem is they're a bit on the heavy side, making extended wear somewhat tedious."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,They are comfortable and sound is very crisp. Suitable for recording in home studio or real studio. Would recommend them for anyone that's trying to be cost effective but still want a quality sound.
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of the sound is more clearly than other head phones
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great!
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. if you need a studio reference headphone and this is the top of your price range or you just want to save some money. these can definitely do the job. my only real con is that after hours strait of use they start hurting my ears due to an insufficient type of padding. the new leather smell is nice when you first get them!

make sure to burn these in for an even better sound"
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has really balanced sound. Fantastic monitors. If you are just listening to music on your stereo you might want headphones with more bass. But for recording and mixing when you want to hear all frequencies clearly, these are terrific. I would buy these again."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very poor bass, but the rest is great."

Black ear protective-coating flakes off rapidly"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome! Great sound quality! I use them at work and just keep them stored in my desk, they are on the large side so not quite as transportable as others, but still all around great headphones. The seller was great too, they were the cheapest by far, and they arrived brand new in box, very well packaged, etc. I am extremely satisfied with this whole purchase."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these are the best headphones I've ever used. The isolation is superb - so strong that it took me some getting used to - and the sound quality is the best I've heard from a pair of headphones."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're not Beats-by-Dre, so I'm actually listening to music instead of the constant humming of a sine wave which is great. Sound reproduction is great. The cord is detachable which is great. Comes with a bag which is great. It feels durable which is great. They leave the top of your head in minor discomfort after about an hour which is...not so great. I'm ok with it cause I shift the headband around a bit then no problems. It acts as a reminder that maybe I should take a break.

In short, I use them only inside for music production and monitoring and they work really well for me. If you're planning to look like a doink and where these outside, just don't. Get Beats-by-Dre, ""bro""."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,My fiance loved them!
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These are well balanced and sound really clear
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. They have great balance of sound.
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds better than my cousin's AKG K701s. I've bought MANY different types of headphones, and these are by far the best. I can hear every instrument clearly and I can even spot the flaws in the mp3 files I have now. The highs are incredibly crisp and the bass seems very natural. The mids are very good. The only problem? I need to get better sound files!"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones because of the detachable cable since that's where most of my headphones have broken in the past. I've had them for a year and a half and they are still fantastic. Nice and flat. Use these nearly every day to mix and besides the leather cracking over the ears they have held up well. Good purchase.
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good.
Thks."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for home recording and guitar practice and I am very pleased they sound great and have large closed ear cups.
I also like the cable that unplugs since most problems with headphone are cable related it is easy to replace. great value!"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphone do exactly what I need them to do. They are not the highest-end Shure's you can pick up but I am extremely satisfied. I was not going for the max bass sound so I'm fine with what they do.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,I have used these for a couple years. Initially they were great. Sound quality was very good for gaming and music (note no microphone)....but...after about a year the plastic starting making horrible creaking noises that can be heard when over ears. This occurs if there is any relative movement between the plastic parts that make up the assembly. It is really annoying and I do not recommend because of this. And I probably will not buy another Shure product because of this issue.
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Already knowing what these headphones could do, I had to order a pair of my own. These headphone are studio quality and built to last. With good noise cancellation and a terrific sound these headphones are amazing. Plus Amazon offered them with a lower price than most other retailers. Whether you are using them for recreational or studio purposes, these will not let you down."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headphones. They are very reliable. Shipping was fast, and the sound is amazing. I definitely recommend this product."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality headphones. Bass response ok but could be a few db better. Otherwise just what Shure always seems to manufacture.
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I read the reviews and they were positive. I am very happy with my purchase and the information provided by the Amazon reviews.
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound, love the way I can remove the cord. I am very satisfied. Also love the carrying bag."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have both SRH 440 and Sony MDR V6 so I'll just make the short comparison between them on this review.

Sound Quality: They almost sound the same. MDR V6 being more detailed and brighter. SRH 440 giving a sound stage feel when listen music. I use my Sony MDR V6 for recording, playing piano, guitar, detailed editing and Shure SRH 440 for listening music, movies or even outdoors.

Comfort: I'll go for my SRH 440 on this. They have a bigger ear cups and it doesn't rest on my ear tip (which is my only complain about the V6) I can wear them longer than V6. They are both warm at the ear when you wear them, and you will definitely know that they are there. Even SRH 440 is heavier than MDR V6, I found 440's are more comfortable to wear anytime.

Built Quality and Durability: Plus on SRH 440 here on two things...better leather-like material on the ear cups and detachable/replaceable cord. Other than that, I think there are both durable and will last a long time.

CONCLUSION: SHURE SRH 440 sound quality is enjoyable, great for easy listening, it gives right lows and highs, not being too bright and easily powered by MP3 player(even the MDR V6) for portability. Comfort; I would say is the main purpose of this headphones. To me, MDR V6 and Shure SRH 440 serves a different purpose.

I'm very happy and pleased with the purchase because of the comfort and feel of the 440s. But I'm thinking buying 750DJ or 840 for more lows because both 440 and V6 have almost the same lows(V6 a little better; would not even make a big or noticeable difference on regular listening). I'm considering SHURE headphones for my next purchase because of thier comfort..very big factor."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,What I was looking for! Sounds are perfectly clear
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because of a review elsewhere. They sound excellent and are loud enough. A bit hot and sweaty after a while and they pinch my ear a bit, which is why only 4 stars. If I'd looked around a bit more I might have got the Sony MDR7506's but to be honest, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried two pairs of Shure earphones, SE110 and SE220, and they didn't work for me: the sound was just below average. No bass!

Then I got a pair of Shure SHR 440 headphones. They are gigantic, they are heavy, they don't fit in your pocket, but do they sound great! Even though they sit above your ears and don't have any noise cancellation electronics, they are very good at reducing airplane noise. And they don't require an additional battery or charger.

My advice: keep whatever earphones you got with your iPhone, Palm Pré or Blackberry and buy a pair of additional headphones like the Shure SHR 440. At $100, they are significantly cheaper than the Bose noise canceling headphones and may just be good enough for what you need. They certainly work for me!"
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit but I had to have them replaced twice while under warranty when the plastic broke. Not hard on them dithery they just sit at my work all day. Just broke again 5 months out of warranty. Great sound but not the sturdiest.
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best earphones at the price. Comfortable and the sound is wonderful. Just what I was looking for for my VO audition editing.
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones if you are new to quality headphones. They offer a good clean sound and have a pleasant amount bass. If they are your first it is easy to get sort of tired though, Because you might not be used to the grip and weight of the headphones and the volume and insulation are other factors that could tire new comers."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value. Respected manufacturer. I run sound weekly for a band and I am extremely pleased with the comfort and quality!
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son who is a musician, and he loves them! Says they are worth much more than the price I paid, which is always good news."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,Bulkier than expected but excellent sound.
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"i used this headphone to mix and to be honest my mixes turn out to be very great, these headphone are very accurate and detail, so if your mix doesnt sound good on them, it doesnt sound good overall and if your mix sound good on them they sound good on everything else, great for mixing"
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones...
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really comfortable and the sound is good but, I may be too picky, but maybe it could've been better, anyway a great product."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The top is not so comfortable, after hours using it you feel the pain. However, the sound is amazing and they last long. 2 years and they keep going. They don't have isolation but if there is no extreme noise around you, you should be fine."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good , but the 'phones are a bit heavy for comfortable use over time. The TRS to mini stereo adapter is a nice touch and the detachable cord is very handy when packing the 'pnones away."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent 8 hours in the studio tracking at full volume with these guys and had to have a pair for home recording. Great sound, great build quality, and great features! If the cord breaks you can replace it. If the earpads are old you can replace em'. They have great sound isolation to boot! At this price they can't be beat."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tho saying they are the best ive ever had is not to big of a deal since before this the most expensive earphones ive had where 20 dollars i can say that the sound quality is way above average. They feel and look like they will last me for years. They are Very comfortable and I love that you can make them more compact for transport and that you can unplug the cable that connects to the computer from the earphones.

As a new person to higher end earphones im quite impressed with the amount of volume this things can pump! At 30% audio is higher than most other cheap earphones ive tried at 100%. i think they can almost sound louder than my on-board speakers. clarity of sound is perhaps about as good as i can imagine. Bass seems incredible, i think it was only limited by the mp3 format, if i knew where the disc was in my house i bet it would sound even better (tho not considerably).

The bad would be purely (in my opinion) on some design points. Tho its understandable that the cable connecting the earphones to each other shows externally i feel like theirs a high possibility at some point of it breaking somehow. In another thought it also looks pretty cool :) makes me look more wired :P.
The other bad would be that it dosen't block as much sound as I hoped it would. but its still blocks a hell of a lot out.

I tried these with Classical music violin concerto from vivaldi (from cd) and electronic from infected mushroom (mp3) for this review.
Ive used them for about a day and i already think its one of the best things i could have spent my money on. ""VERY WISE SPENDING"" i would say :P ive already demoed it to 3 other people and they also think they are awesome.

I guess i might edit this post in the future(if i can) if i have any problems with them.... or if i cant stop praising them :P"
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"When the plug on my old pair of Grado SR80s needed replacing, I decided to give these a try. I was hugely disappointed. The sound was so different from the Grados I almost felt like I was listening to entirely different mixes of anything I listed to. The bass overpowered everything else. On top of that, I discovered that it is impossible to wear these headphones while wearing eyeglasses. So I returned them and got Grado to replace the plug on my old headphones."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best phones I've ever had. But then the ""best"" are the Sony MDR V-250s with their volume, mono-stereo adjustable cable
I listen mostly to classical music and jazz. I like the smoothness in the treble and midrange, although a bit lacking in the bass.
Front to back soundstage is good. Reservations: highly sensitive in volume in that you barely have to turn the volume up
with a Sony Walkman or phone jack on You Tube. However, if you keep your Walkman at a reasonable volume, you'll be
surprised how good audio cassettes can sound. Phones a bit tight on the head, so take them off at about an hour.
Detachable cable excellent idea to avoid twisting. Can plug into 15-foot extension cable easily. I picked these, reading audio
forums' reviews by studio musicians. I figured that these experts would be good judges of headphones quality.
Overall, they are worth the money and I find, if I prefer, to plug them into the phones output of a Marantz 63 CD player and
listen in bed to a classical recording."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic set of headphones. Great isolation, clear highs and mids, with tight non-exaggerated bass. Sound great when connected to iPhone or my laptop."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the product based on the review I read in Wired magazine. It is as good as advertised. My only problem is that it does not fit my head tightly and it moves when I am doing work in the yard. It is okay if you are just sitting/lounging.
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far the headphones have lived up to their expectations. For the price, the sound is excellent. I would agree with other reviews I have read that although comfortable, during long listening duration tend to have slightly too much pressure on the sides of the head, I'm optimistic that this will fade with more use."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for a little over a year now. The plastic above both ear muffs has cracked and I have been forced to tape them back together. I have not been overly abusive or stepped on them. The plastic just wore out quickly. I also had to replace the thin ear muffs they came with because my ears would touch the plastic on the inside and it would become uncomfortable after about 30min. I replaced them with Brainwavzs HM5.

The sound is good and I have enjoyed them for as long as I have had them up to this point. They are too tight now, due to the tape on both sides, and will be replaced by something with a little more longevity."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very analytical at times, and fast headphones. They do really well with all sorts of metal, rock, acoustic, classical, and even electronic. Throw any of your most complex and noisy songs at these headphones and they still still be able to separate everything out and let you listen to everything. As with most full sized headphones, this one is no exception, the 3D imaging is very good and among the best I've ever heard. They are comfortable, but not built from the best materials. They will survive multiple drops for sure, but they creak a lot, even when new. The plastics are decent, but the headband and earcup pleather isn't from the highest quality sources. Also sometimes my ears can feel the dynamic drivers of the headphones! There is no headclamping tho! and they do fold up!

Compared to the also really popular Audio Technica M-50, they sound much less colored and professional, but with distinctly dropped low end bass response. The M50's probably are just a tad slower, so they are fine for metal and rock, but their treble is less smooth, the bass is at times too bumbped, and mids are clearly recessed. also soundstage and instrument separation is better on the shures. On the other hand, if sound quality is second only to build quality, go with the Audio Technica's. They are clearly superiorly built. They are made form better materials and have better cushions, although the headclamping was quite severe for my slightly large head."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sound quality headphones for the price. Neutral, accurate, and remarkably crisp sounding. It's lacking a bit of bass, but it's actually not that bad, only if you're used to artificially boosted headphones will you be disappointed.

My only problem, and why I deducted a star, is the build quality itself. It's not flimsy or anything, even appears/feels to be pretty solid... and it would be aside from that GODDAMN EXPOSED WIRE connecting the left/right earcups. I've gone through 3 of these headsets now over 3 years from that cable going bad, and this will be my last one. I'm extremely careful with my headphones and they never leave my desk, just a long time of putting them on and taking them off and adjusting the band wears out that cable. It's a super common problem among long term 440/840 owners, and I'm not interested in the DIY BS behind recabling the headset.

When I can afford it my next headset is going to be a Shure 940, as that wire is fully enclosed unlike the 440/840. With that problem corrected it'd be the perfect headset and probably would last a really long time. Wire aside I love the way it's purpose built for sound quality, and isn't some fashion accessory.

ALSO! If you do get these, I highly recommend you pick up the 840 earcups. Improves the sound a bit and the comfort is amazing. I wear them all day every day working."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at several higher end options, I choose the Shure 440 phones based on median price vs. high reviews. I have to say, I'm 100% pleased. I'm using these with Logic on my MacBook Pro and for that purpose they are excellent as monitors. In addition, they are great for general use when I want quality personal audio. In case any shoppers are interested in knowing, the connection cord DOES disconnect completely from the phones. An option that I'm fond of, as cords tend to wear out faster than other parts of headphones. They are also coiled and springy. The included case probably won't get much use as I hang up my phones and I was doubly impressed by the included 1/4"" adapter that screws onto the cord and makes a secure connection.
The phones are all plastic but they have a great weight and feel to them and they are as far from ""cheap"" feeling as they can be. The pad in the band doesn't provide as much cushion as you'd expect, but it isn't uncomfortable. The cups provide moderate sound dampening and are wearable for hours before becoming even a nuisance.
As for those who talk down the sound, they must be listening to a poor audio source. Wen connected to good audio, these phones reproduce it wonderfully. The bass response is deep, the highs are crisp, and the mids don't muddy the sound."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I review these headphones, I must say something about their intended purpose. These are NOT designed for listening to music anywhere except sitting down in your home or in a studio. The cord is incredibly long and bulky, and the headphones are far from stylish. If you're looking for headphones you can wear on-the-go, stop right here and go look for some in-ear-monitors or smaller sized headphones. If you are looking for the best sound quality you can find in $100 headphones, and don't care much about anything else, this is probably the right place.

Design Overview:
These headphones are MASSIVE. These are my first pair of studio monitors and I was not expecting them to be as giant as they are. I have a normal sized head- These headphones look ridiculous on me and on larger heads, still seem pretty big. I am not a very fashion-minded person but even I think twice about taking these around. The headphones fold up for convenience, allowing them to fit in my backpack without too much trouble. The cord is one of my biggest gripes with the headphones. It is not on par with the quality of the rest of the headphone.

Comfort:
These headphones will hurt your ears and the top of your head after about an hour. I was very disappointed with the stock earpads, and the plastic headband is covered by what seems to be leather with little to no padding. About a month after I bought these, I ordered the replacement earpads from Shure's higher end version of the product, the SRH-840, and slapped those onto my SRH-440. I am much happier with the comfort of these headphones with this 15 dollar investment.

Cord:
The only thing I like about this cord is that it is detachable and twists to lock into a jack on the headphone. I have a lot of issues with the stock cord. It is something like 10 feet long uncoiled, and even coiled up takes up too much space on my small computer desk. The cord is cheaply made, with the wires nestled into a plasticky tube that gets kinked up permanently much like a garden hose. Within three months the cord was unbearably tangled and did not coil up properly. With this stock coiled cord, it is impossible to go anywhere with the headphones as you have a large bundle of cord that barely fits into a pocket by itself, much less with an mp3 player. I replaced the cord with Shure's straight cord, just to find the cord was still something like 8 feet long, and made of the same low-quality garden hose plastic. The best thing about this cord, how it locks into the headphone, also made it very hard to find a third-party, decent cord. After some hunting on eBay, I found a reasonable length cord made from decent material. I should not have to go through this much trouble to find a cord I can walk with, and don't completely understand the appeal of a cord this long, unless you sit 10 feet away from your audio jack in a studio.

Sound:
I'm no audiophile, but I can tell you without a doubt that this is some of the best sound you can find in a headphone at this price range. Each instrument in your music becomes separate from each other, and much more clear. Low quality earbuds will bother you with how muddled they sound after listening to these cans. With a headphone amp such as the FiiO E11, you can even hear small details of each instrument that are difficult to describe. The sound of these headphones is never harsh, and the sound is warm but crisp. The only downside of the sound is a minor deficiency in bass. A lot of headphones have far too much bass, but these have the treble slightly overpowering. I'm not complaining- this is easy to fix with a small EQ adjustment.

Conclusion:
Overall, these are great headphones. I'm fairly picky about quality, and most likely, others won't have as much of a problem with the design of these cans. The manufacturer was likely trying to keep the price down on these while still maintaining an entry-level audiophile sound. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped decide your purchase. Below is where I found my custom cord and earpads:

SOUND: I didn't burn them in, but right out the box they sounded great. The bass tends to be weaker than I'd like on some songs, but on others is all-enveloping and punchy... so it obviously depends on the recording/compression/etc. On my iPod the sound was noticeably flat sounding... but plugged into the audio port on my MacBook Pro, they sound incredible. Spoken word is especially impressive, such as podcasts, movie trailers, etc. I mostly listen to electronic, trance, pop, new wave, and many ""independent"" artists... so I really wanted something that would bring out the vibrancy and depth of my library w/o making a $400+ investment. These do the job very, very well.

DESIGN & BUILD: The only thing that really turned me off to these phones was the vinyl ear pads, which seemed cheap and out-dated - that is, before I opened the box. They are actually very soft, durable and of very good quality. The SRH 440s hug my head perfectly. The only discomfort I get is when they are on for long periods of time, as the lack of cushioning on the headband tends to be quite painful for me... but I find this only happens when they are sitting just a bit too far back on the top of my head, and so a quick adjustment alleviates it immediately. Like others have said, the build of the 440s is solid and made to last. The small wires that run from each earphone into the headband cause me to be more careful when handling them though... I'm just afraid I'll snag them on something.

OVERALL: These are my first over-the-ear headphones, and the sound and build is all of fairly high quality. I've owned some great sound systems, for example my previous car was an imported Volvo w/ Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (I have never and have yet to hear a sound system so powerful and sophisticated, on the right night/day, that baby could take me to another galaxy lol) and I think I know sound well enough for my endorsement to be warranted and informed. For the price, these are an essential for either the casual listener or audiophile looking for a decent pair of headphones (and I supposed studio recording as well, as that is what they are made for)."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are wonderful headphones. I needed to limit my expenditure to $100 or less and tried to compare different products around that price. Being an old guy, I listen to everything, classical, jazz, rap, rock, opera and so on, but not Justin Bieber. ;-) They are very comfortable and handled everything beautifully. Cecilia Bartoli's Don Giovanni is crisp and clean. Notorious B.I.G's Ready to Die is rich and deep in the bass and his great voice clearly articulated. You can hear all the subtle interplay on Miles Davis' Stella by Starlight. I compared these to Beats by Dr. Dre, which cost dearly. Frankly, I don't hear a big enough difference to justify spending another $100, but each to their own. The detachable cord is a nice touch. All the good reviews these get are well-deserved."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoever I bought this from was great because they let me return it & I didn't have to pay to have them intercept it from the carrier. What great customer service - very professional & friendly. I do own a pair of these, and wow, they are amazing. I e-mailed customer service, and apparently you can buy the earcups for the 840's & those will give u better bass response. I'm not sure if you'd want it personally (Because they are so neutral already & that's kind of the point), but that's one area I had problems with when it came to mixing -- otherwise they are really great at getting a good feel of how the landscape & mix sounds. I would say that these are the best for a neutral sounding mix. What you hear is what you get besides the bass which is a little weak in the mix, but that is ok too. Like I said, you can get the 840 cups, but I heard on the internet that these were purposely made neutral compared to the 840's for mixing and monitoring. I might get the 840's cups because the bass was a little weak in mixing & I made the bass a little loud and had to readjust the bass mix on stereo speakers (which is good to do anyways). So there you have it. Would recommend over the HD 280's & basically anything else in this price range (have not compared to Sony's 7506 but from a couple reviews they are at least equal with the 7506's except maybe the bass but the tone is more neutral & even overall -- I heard that the 7506's are a little pronounced in the high mid's)."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes rock solid stuff. These headphones are no exception. I use them for video audio editing and hear stuff on these my ears don't hear any other way. Built with a plug in to replace cord that is inexpensive was one deciding factor, others were the solid build and Shure's Military quality products. I've got a Shure 58 mike that they demonstrate driving a nail through a 2x4... if that's what a sensitive mike will take, I figure I can beat a rhinoceros senseless with these and still have them working. Highly recommended."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"To continue on this trend, they're perfect headphones. Only improvement is quality: but I'm talking $500 dollar quality. For the price they're great overall. My main concern was durability, connections, and comfort. You can wear these for hours, and you won't feel them, since they completely go around the ear. They can be dropped and won't break, and the wire as well as the cushions are replaceable so that's all a plus. The phone line wire is also a plus, as won't make you trip over everything or fear for the life of headphones as they hook on door knobs, etc. AND IT ALWAYS happens, you know it too.

Overall - - cannot complain. The BASS could be better, but for $70 bucks? Once again, I'm talking ridiculous, move your brain bass - these headphones produce great quality, just not at the $300-500 range of course.

Buy them - I did days of research on this before purchase, and it paid off: best headphones for this price by far."

I received these for Christmas and proceeded to have an extended listening session with my iPod. I initially thought they were ok but as I listened more I heard some stuff that I just did not like. In the low end I heard quiet a bit of distortion when the bass drum and bass guitar really got going. By the way the mids and highs were really crisp but what are they without the low end.

I have decided to send them back and try again with a pair of Sony MDR-V6. Check for the coming review for them."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 pairs as extra ""cans"" for my home studio. They sound great and the closed back, over-ear design provides nice bleed-through prevention as advertised. Great headphones for recording on a budget."

2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these headphones for good quality music and it was an excellent buy. They sound better than a lot of $150-$300 headphones I've listened to. First item I've ever rated 5 stars.

And I've had quite a few. From Sony to Bose, and even Shure and Sennheiser.

4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,i love these headphones! i can hear all the details of the music. they perform especially well for the base part. the only thing is that it is a little bit heavy if you wear it for a long time.

These headphones are very comfortable and keep sound in and out fairly well. I will say that the bass isn't going to blow you away but the overall sound quality of the headphones is very crisp and clear. The detachable headphone jack is also a plus, considering that I have ruined many good headphones by damaging the cord. If you have your eyes on these headphones I would still recommend that you test before you buy to see how you like them."

I've recently picked up a few hours a week of voicetracking work, and was happy to buy new headphones! I was very pleased when I received these; they sounded great and were wonderfully compact. After a few weeks, I started having problems: they cut in and out on me. Sometimes they would work, sometimes they wouldn't. And two weeks ago, the ear pads both fell off. I'm just very disappointed- for what I expected the quality and durability of these to be paired with the price tag, I sure hadn't anticipated problems like these."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price of these headphones, you can't go wrong.

I was very disappointed with the sound of the Shures. I found them to be mid-heavy and muffled with weak highs and non-existent lows.
The build quality is very nice and they are fairly efficient or I wouldn't give them 3 stars.
But even though they say the new ones ""aren't as good as the old ones"" I got another pair of the Sony MDR-V6s... which btw I think are also superior to the Sony MDR7506."

0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Totally disappointed. I could not get a good fit, they slipped off my head. I could not get them to stay on. This isn't helped by the coiled cord, which either pulled my headphone amp off my desk or the phones off as it's too stiff, would hardly uncoil. The volume was WAY too low- playing at a medium volume I could not hear the music. Sorry, but they were useless to me."

8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"In running a professional studio finding the right headphones has always been a problem. They need to be durable, true sounding and isolating. We always used the AKG 141's and 240's but they are not very robust and need lots of TLC to keep running. They sound great but are open backed so the isolation is not optimal. But now a new pair of 141's are close to $150.The Beyer Dt 770 are better isolating, though they sound a bit ""canny"" not very natural in the vocal range. But they are $199 a pair.The Audio Technica ATH 50's sound great but are also in the $200 range

Enter Shure, the makers of the revered 57 microphone. The SRH 440 Headphones sound excellent,isolate well,are rugged and best of all I found them for $80 on Amazon. Now when they get thrown across the room I don't worry.

The only thing I don't like about them is the coil cord they come with. Straight cables are much more practical for studio use. But the cables are detachable.

We've been using them for a few weeks now and they are liked by me and the professional singers we work with.

1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these about two years ago. At first they sounded terrible. I just dismissed them altogether and used my stereo monitors to produce music instead of these. I then went back and used them extensively for several months. They did sound better after awhile. I guess they needed to be burnt in. I still feel that I wasted my money on these. The sound is very flat (ideal for hearing each track), but they are so flat that it just sounds muddy across the board.
The bass is nonexistent. The mids are muddy, and the highs are very low in the spectrum. I've listened to all kinds of music through these and it is what it is. I think they should lower the price dramatically for these. I'd say $35 to $45 would be more like it. Overall, I would NOT recommend them, but they do barely do what they are advertised. There are so many better cans out there that you might as well spend $30 or more for. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50 is what I use now and it is a world of difference. I cannot say enough good things about that particular pair.

These are just so muddy and blah. Save your money."

5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially liked these headphones a lot- they seemed to reproduce mixes I tested on them accurately, and were very neat and sturdy in design.

My opinion changed recently when after a number of really bad experiences of dubbing vocals, I found that the culprit was none other than these headphones.

My Apogee Duet produces a great, clear sound that translates well on my Sennheiser headphones, however those aren't closed back like these. I got these to monitor instruments and vocals as I would record them, however I would choke (and others who tried to sing with these on as well) and have difficulty in doing so.

The underlying reason, I found, was that these headphones over-accentuate the high frequencies to where listening through them is unbearable and makes monitoring sounds painful.

I think this is specifically the case with me because the Duet seems to deliver very transparent high frequencies, but I noticed the same increase in driving the hi's when I A/B'd directly from my Macbook, and it made me super uncomfortable to listen to.

I'd warn anyone before buying and committing to these, to test them first and return them if they give you the same difficulties and uneasiness they've given me especially while recording."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad sound. Save your money.
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440 is the best set of over ear monitors I've ever heard for critical listening in the price range. I don't think you can buy a better set of non-noise canceling cans for around $100. I think many headphones that cost $200 or less fall short of the sound quality. The build quality is sturdy, and I can tell I will have these headphones for a lifetime. Even not extended, they hug my very average sized head just right, and there's plenty of slack for people with bigger heads. And they are comfertable for hours at a time, and the pads are soft pleather but, not the cheap stuff. Plus they are replaceable.
They keep a fairly decent amount of sound out, if they were a little more snug they would keep more out, but even so walking down the street you have to try to get distracted by cars going by. If you're from or have ever been on the T in Boston, you know how loud it is. With these things on my head, I can still hear the very muted grinding of the rails, but its hard to care when even on the quietest volume setting on my 80GB ipod classic the music is not only still very audible, it's clear as day.
The highs, mids, and lows are completley balanced like a flat equalizer setting, unbiased on there own and not effecting each others presence. I wouldn't recommend them if you're a bass junkie, because the base is very smooth and even for both electronic music or a big jazzy double bass. Whether on the lowest or highest volume on any device I've used it with, everything is extremely clear and life-like. All genres of music and talk. Listening to rock you can relearn what distortion is supposed to be, listening to classical you can hear the sweat on the soloist fingers as they slide around the strings, listening to stand up has that scratchy, sweaty pickup of a comedy club mono channel microphone.
I bought these for an everything, every day user after enjoying the Shure SE210 in ear monitors for two years. I took a chance because I didnt know a lot about these phones, just that shure had not yet let me down. I must say, I am a customer for life.
I cant even begin to imagine what the SRH840's sound like, but I'm guessing for $200 they blow everything $350 and under out of the water.

9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,NO REVIEW NECESSARY...THE RATINGS SPEAK FOR ITSELF...GREAT PRODUCT FOR ME WHEN I'M DOING MY MUSIC IN THE STUDIO
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not someone to write many reviews but in this case i will. i purchased these, used them the first month, worked fine and sat them a side for about a year. I plugged them this morning and now they have a short in them. Do not buy these, a waste of 100 bucks."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"I started out looking for a headset, and everyone said ""go get some headphones and a mic, it will sound a lot better"" so I did, and honestly I was expecting more. These headphones sound about the same to me as my logitech g35s, which cost the same amount, and were actually comfortable. I'm just going to list the rest of this in pros and cons though, because that will make it a lot more clear.

Pros: none, I mean honestly, they sound the exact same to me.

Cons:

Comfort: This is honestly the least comfortable thing I have ever worn, people will recommend the shure 840 earpads, and while that helps a little they are still extremely uncomfortable. Basically, if you want to pay $90 for a constant headache, then these are for you. The earpads that come with the headset are entirely too small and incredibly uncomfortable, and the headband causes me frequent headaches.

Sound quality: I am no audiophile, and maybe I'm just deaf or something, but these sound no better than my old G35s which is a usb headset for those who don't know.

Basically, this headset was quite possibly my least pleasant purchase I have ever made, and I intend to return it as soon as time allows."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the design and portability considering they're over the ear headphones. Shure in general is a high quality brand, with a great reputation for making professional products. However, these sound terrible. The sound is garbled and muddy, and lacking definition. Bass especially loses definition. My old Sony MDR-V6's, which needed to be replaced after over a decade of reliable use and performance, sound substantially better than the Shure's. I tried a friend of mine's top of the line version of these, and they sounded very good. They were natural and neutral sounding, yet well defined. He and I both thought I would still get a good sounding product even with a lower end model. That's unfortunately not the case. I tried to see if burning them in over night would help, but my complaints never changed. The material covering the phones seems to easily soil, leading me to believe they won't hold up over time. Even the the foam surrounding the ear pieces seemed to loose their firmness after an hour or so of continuous listening. I don't expect these to last me anywhere near as long as my Sony's did, and they certainly don't sound as good. There are a few positives, such as the fact they fold up relatively compact making them fairly easy to travel with for headphones of this type. And the cord is detachable which should help it last longer in terms of wear and tear. These are also very sensitive phones. I plugged them into an airplane jack and they seemed a little loud even at the lowest volume setting. However, overall I would not recommend these or purchase them again."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm the type who likes to hear every detail in the music. When listening to an old analog track from the 70s I actually think it's cool to hear the increasing ""hiss"" as each instrument is punched in as the song builds. Or to hear the singer(s) take a breath just before committing their lines. Both the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro(which I have owned since 2007) and Shure's newer SRH-440 enable me to do that very well, and at *reasonable* not too loud volumes.

I looked up both headphones at headphone . com. The graphs of their freq response correspond well with how they actually sound to my ears, hence the title to this review. Both phones are very close in performance in the lows to mids, and in the high frequencies. I have next to no sensitivity above 12kHz, so I cannot comment on either in that respect.

Where they differ, and you will see this at the website I referenced, is in their handling of deep(below 80Hz) bass and of the high-midrange section (3-4kHz). The Sennheiser does NOT lack for bottom! It's not boomy - just *there*. The Shure needs a little nudge of the LF EQ band to match the Senneheiser, but where it out""shines"" the Sennie is in that high area just where midrange becomes treble. It isn't glaringly bright there, but you can definitely hear more breathing and sibilance through the Shure. The Sennheisers are good for overall listening, but if you are a techno or house/club music junkie or modern rock affecionado you will fall in love with the bass bottom of these. The Shures have most of the spectrum covered, but will specifically satisfy classical listeners with their interpretation of strings and other high-freq instruments, as well as jazz and most rock sub-genres.

All in all, they are a draw as far as sound quality goes.

Construction/Comfort wise, both are decently built. Nothing plasticky cheap about either, although the Sennheiser is slightly heavier. The HD280 has that ""vise-grip"" on your head - something which I just accepted as being part & parcel with classic German quality. It doesn't bother me and has actually loosened slightly in the 3 years I've owned them. The Shure - not nearly as tight. In fact, when leaning my head up to see my monitor or down to see what the cat is throwing up(!) the headband slips down over my forehead or back. If the Sennies were tight these are loose! No amount of adjustment helps, unless one has a much larger head than I.

Still, they isolate sound almost as well as the Sennheisers, and sound just as good, in their own way. I recommend either - and find it a good idea to have two decent cans around to listen to and monitor my music. There is also a body of thought out there that both speakers and headphones should be ""broken - or burned"" in. Nothing wrong with that, so long as bass/treble controls are kept flat and no EQ is employed. Play a variety of your favorite CDs through the headphone at the loudest volume you'd COMFORTABLY listen to for AT LEAST 10-12 hours, and let them play over night in the corner. ++On that note a good-old-fashioned CD carousel or 6disc magazine is a great asset++ Burning in can't hurt, as long as the phones or speakers aren't blasting to the point of distortion. And my Sandisk Sansa mp3 player drives them both quite well, the Shures slightly louder at the same volume given the Sennheisers."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have Shure mic. for ever, so I thought Shure headphone must be great... boys that was a mistake... sounds like crap, no bass, sounds leak, uncomfortable to wear... poorly design and just look cheap... I returned it."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Others have written better reviews than I could but after owning these for 5 years I have a couple recommendations.

1) They do creak - This can be lessened or eliminated completely by using some silicone lubricant at the joints. Do not use oil or grease though as it could eat the plastic.
2) The standard ear pads aren't very comfortable. I swapped mine out with Shure HPAEC940 Replacement Velour Ear Pads for SRH940 Headphones (Pair). They're MUCH better and fit perfectly.
3) If you're adventurous... some people have modded these headphones with amazing results. Check the google if interested.

Overall these headphones have and continue to serve me well. For the price, I'm not sure they can be beat."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a 'refurbished' Shure SRH440 a few days ago. It was just like new but the seal on the box had been opened. At first, I liked it, but didn't love it.

But as others have mentioned, the ear pads aren't great. Shure should bite the bullet and just build the 440s with the 840s ear pads! I haven't ordered the Shure 840 ear pads as many have recommended (why should the user have to spend another $15 to make the product comfortable???)...instead I did the 'sock mod'...I am just NOT a fan of 'pleather'.

Swiped a black pair of socks (not too thin and not too thick, but soft) from the hubby's sock drawer and cut the top 3.75"" off of each one. Put the top (finished) end of the sock around the outside of ear cup and tucked the 'cut' end into the recess inside the ear pad. However, it won't stay tucked without help. I cut two 9"" segments (one for each ear pad) from a TV cable (coax) and curled them into tight circles and tucked them into the recess inside the ear pad, to hold the cut end of the socks in place. Ahhh...much better now.

Some people have said they don't feel the 440 has enough bass, but it is perfect for me...I do not like deep, heavy, booming bass. The sound is crisp, clear, clean. Very good isolation...outside sounds stay outside...inside sounds stay inside...just as you would expect from a circumaural, closed-back headphone.

I have seen several 440s (as well as 840s) on Ebay broken at the hinges. The 440 is plastic, so I would recommend putting it on, taking it off, and adjusting it using equal pressure with both hands and being gentle when folding up.

While reading reviews, do note that everyone has different shaped/size heads and ears, and different hearing acuity. I guess that is why reviews for the same model of headphones often range from 1-5 stars!

I am giving these 4 stars due to the ear pads and potential for breakage at the hinges. I also wish that there were more cable choices instead of long coiled or long straight. I would much prefer a 3-4 foot straight, but since there is a special connector at the end that attaches to the headphone, I haven't found any alternatives. Some enterprising person should make different lengths and sell them on Ebay!

I think the sound is GREAT and highly recommend the 440s in the under $100 headphone class....but I am NO EXPERT!

However, check out the ""NVX Audio XPT100 Studio Over-Ear Headphones w/ ComfortMax Earpad Cushions and Extra Pair of Angled Earpads"", as well as a short and long cord, and padded storage container...on Amazon, which I rated 5 stars.

UPDATE 10/12/14 - In order to make the 440 more comfortable/useable:

Go to a fabric store and get a piece of 'minky' material to wrap around the headband for cushioning:

7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome! Clear, full, rich sound with strong response across the entire frequency range without overwhelming bass! They are also quite comfortable and the shape and size of the earcups is almost perfect in my opinion. I love the removable/replaceable cord with the twist to lock feature. It's also coiled which I prefer since coiled wires stay out of the way more and still have the necessary length. I compare these with ANY headphones at twice the price!! I can think of only two extremely minor quibbles about these - 1) The exposed wires by each earcup might get caught on something, and 2) They are a little on the weighty side. I would point out that the exposed wires makes it easier for the hinged earcups to fold up into the headpiece easier. Given the tremendous quality of sound and workmanship of these headphones, it seems rather picayune to point out such minor imperfections of such a stellar product! I have several other sets of headphones of common, well known brands that are all very good, but none of them are as excellent as these! I cannot recommend the Shure SRH440 more highly!! Fantastic sound at a great price! Remember these are designed as studio or home headphones and not meant to be worn while walking around, running, etc."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to analyse music sounds. I usually listen a song many times over and enjoy various parts of instrumental at different instances. I do not appreciate any deviation from flat response by phones (or speakers) as it can be easily achieved by equalizer, but cannot be undone if you buy a low quality phones with distinctive resonances. For long time I have been using Sennheiser HD45x series and more recently Sennheiser 280. As much I have been surprised when putting these first time on (in 1994) I am now surprised with my newest acquisition SURE SRH 440. Yes the difference is clearly audible: mid and high tones are ""clearer"". Note that this is not simply described by a frequency response. Clearness means that the membrane can reproduce more complex non-repetitive sounds more faithfully. There is no clear technical measure of it: one must hear the difference. With SRH 440 I can hear and trace hidden tones and their echos (if exist) much clearer and at lower volume than with any others I tried. That said, one has to be aware of other limitations. Sound cards of most computers and laptops (I do not even want to go into mobiles), bad studio recording practice, low bps rendering etc. are sufficient to erase any advantage of these fine phones versus cheaper ones.You also need to have very good ears too. I know that because of my old age (50), or too many antibiotics, my right ear has slightly lost its analytics (that said it is still excellent) so I am not going to buy $2k phones in this incarnation no more. Having in mind average level of bad hearing of the hi-fidelity-equipment-ignorant generation (people coldly enyoing 128kbps mp3s or not being able to hear a difference between mono and stereo), I believe that these phones are just too god for most. So do not dwell: buy it and I ma pretty sure you'll enjoy it."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones sound good. I used them at work nearly every day for about two years. The main problem is that you have to hold really still. The headphones are light, mostly due to the plastic construction. After using them for a few months, they started squeeking when I moved. The longer I used them, the more they squeeked at all the plastic joints. If I hold still, they sound great. But since I don't sit that still, I've switched over to using the Sony MDR7520 instead. Sound quality is still excellent, but the cheap squeeky plastic is gone."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440's are just jaw dropping amazing phones. I wanted a good set of headphones to listen to my music and as a monitor when I play my keyboard. I set out to Guitar center set to spend around $250. To my amazement Guitar center did not have a demo station set up. I was still able to demo several brands Senns,Audio Tech, upon request using my ipod as a source. I demoed the Senn HD 380 pro, nice sound,comfortable,not blown away. I also tried out the Audio Technica ATH-M50 witch was a big let down after reading all the great reviews. I has a very boomy(loose) bottom end and the mids and highs were average at best. I then went to Sam Ash just around the corner and they had an awesome demo station set up with probably 20+ headphones for demo (from $29-$179) and they had some more expensive ones in a glass case that the salesman said I was welcomed to try. I think I tried them all,Sony 7506,KRK 8400,Senns 280 pro,380 pro, Shure 840's(nice but somewhat flat for mixing). I didn't try any of the $300+ phones ,out of my price range. When I put The Shure 440's on it was like the music came to life, beautiful mids, bass was punchy not boomy at all and the highs were great also. I've read complaints that the bass is lacking, well not from my ears. It's punchy and precise,perfect. If you're into artificial unnatural boomy sounding bass then you'll probably like the Dr.dre's. These are the best sounding closed headphones at $200. and below without a doubt. Comfort is another thing, very stiff pads. I changed mine out with the Shure 840 pads,HEAVEN ! Get these and be happy !"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Shure SRH440 headphones as a hobbyist audio engineer since 2009, and there are so many things to love about these headphones.

Pros:
* Fantastic sound quality across the entire spectrum. Deep lows, solid mids and crystal clear highs; in the top 10% of headphones I've used
* Comfortable fit and size for average and large heads
* Well constructed, solidly built; I transport my set back and forth from work every day without a case, still working as well as the day I bought them
* Fabric/leather have deteriorated significantly over the years of abuse, but this is only cosmetic, and held up much better than expected
* Decent noise isolation -- not amazing, but good
* Comes with 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter
* Extendable cord for easy for comfortable mobility while wearing set
* Comes with great fabric carrying case

I can only think of one con:
* Very thin layer of fabric between your ear and plastic -- can get uncomfortable after extended use

I've had these headphones for 7 years, one of the best purchases I've ever made. If you want a good mid-range set of headphones that give you clear and accurate sound, you couldn't do better than this set."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am happy with this product, so far. I have only had it for a week so I can't be sure how durable it is, but it was comfortable enough to wear for several hours without much pain. I have somewhat large ears that are often hurt my studio headphones, but these aren't so bad. They hurt slightly less with the SHR840 ear muffs I bought for them, as well.

The sound these produce seems accurate and balanced. I was expecting a little bit more of the higher frequency bass and a little less of the lowest frequencies, but I think that was because my other headphones are designed to emphasize bass, which is bad for my current needs. If I want bass, I would rather use a knob or filter to get it. I do wish Windows had a global equalizer. It's insane that we have to rely on sound drivers for a global equalizer under a modern Microsoft OS. I guess I could always get an external one if it bothers me that much.

These really are great sounding headphones; especially for recording."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a big head, and I found the stock ear pads combined with the headband size gave me headaches within an hour every time I put these on. In addition, my first pair had mismatched drivers (or some other issue) causing one side to play significantly more quietly than the other. After noticing this issue, I measured the resistance of each driver at the jack and one was ~39ohms and the other was ~70ohms. I guess this may be a somewhat widespread issue, because a few of the reviews I found online show frequency response curves with seemingly significant differences between each ear's driver.

I was able to work with Shure to get a replacement, and they were very responsive and their replacement process is totally reasonable. (They don't offer advance replacement, but overall the process was easy to follow and they don't even require an RA number for you to send items in for repair, just that you complete a repair form and send it along with the item.) The replacement set resolved the issue with one side playing more quietly than the other. The replacement set came in full retail packaging with all accessories too, so that was nice.

To address the comfort issue, I upgraded the earpads to the HPAEC840 model. That helped quite a lot, and I can wear these now for probably 90 minutes without a headache. I think the band has stretched a bit over time as well, so overall they're reasonably comfortable today.

As for the sound, I really enjoy it. I like the sound better than the Koss A-250 headset that I'd used many years before this. The sound seems very natural, and when I use an equalizer to flatten the response, they actually have remarkably good bass for a 40mm headset. The EQ settings I'm using today are:
29Hz: 0.0dB
59Hz: -9.4dB
119Hz: -10.1dB
237Hz: -7.5dB
474Hz: -10.1dB
947Hz: -7.5dB
1.9kHz: -5.0dB
3.8kHz: -7.5dB
7.5kHz: -10.1dB
15kHz: -7.5dB"
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok I heard a lot of good things about these online and decided that I wanted some headphones for home use so I decided to get these.

At first use, the sounds are very decent with excellent mid range sounds. This is not a headphone for people that like the sound of bass that rattles a car's trunk. These are for those that want to hear every detail in a song...even the minute ones. It offers good bass, but just not to an extreme some people would like.

I had an issue though it seems to have gone away. I would have one side of the headset go out but slowly. The music would cut, then vocals. I checked to see if it was properly connected and twisted and it was. The issue seems to have resolved itself though its a bit unsettling once you've just received the headset.

Whats cool is that these headphones fold in so they are easier to transport if you do have to take them somewhere.

Personally, and if you have an ear with a protruding antihelix such as myself, these headphones (and probably many others) will hurt if you wear them for 30+ minutes. There is nothing but a very thin material between your ear and the plastic base over the speaker. This will push the ear creating discomfort.

Its a great headphone, but comfort is lacking (for me) and im concerned about the reliability of this pair...back to my music...

*update 6/14/11* having problems yet again with the left (cord side) speaker/cable problem. For some reason the speaker kicks in an out. Sometimes when I unplug it and plug it back in, it works...sometimes it doesnt fix the problem. I will probably have to contact the vendor.

*update 7/23/11* contacted seller about sending the headset back.

*update 8/12/11* contacted manufacturer

update and probably last. contact attempts failed with shure as they have been unresponsive to the last 2 emails i sent out. Feb 27 and March 8 were the last dates of the emails. Issue unresolved. Minus star for customer service."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair of these SRH440's I heard had long been well broken-in and they sounded PHENOMENAL. GREAT bass, distinct mids and crisp highs. Very good sound stage, the kind you can imagine the sound out beyond your walls and that you can FEEL! Well, I got my own pair recently and I have got to say that unequivocably no doubt regardless of what anyone says; these things NEED a break-in period. Bass was great off the bat. But mids and highs were something to be desired. I used some high-frequency break-in sweeps from YouTube with the cups rubber-banded facing each other to isolate the sound during the break-in. Not too loud though. After some 50 hours of this, I must say I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED! Sound across the spectrum just jumps out at you! BEST headphones I have ever owned! And I have heard some great ones from back in the 70's when AUDIOPHILE headphones sounded far better than most today! After break-in, sounded with FAR
better BASS,these sounds through the mids and highs like some of the better EARphones I have heard. FANTASTIC! GO SHURE!"
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"This are the most amazing headphones ever, I simply love them, I have had them for years now, and I honestly wouldn't know what to do without them, they are just so natural. I am a professional Music Producer, I mix and do mastering for living, moved to NYC for grad school and I do not have mixing monitors here as I did back home, so, I had to get used to work on headphones, and of course I trusted this amazing ones, if you are a hip-hop/electro fan, I mean, IF YOU WANT ""BEATS"" SOUND-LIKE HEADPHONES,, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, if you instead do like good quality, natural sound and amazing resolution in all the frequency range, DON'T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING ANYWHERE ELSE, I have used very expensive headphones like the Sennheiser HD600, and they do not compare, I actually decided not to listen to any other headphones again in my life, so that way my ears get so used to this ones that I can keep mixing and mastering with no issues, that's how this headphones actually are, plus they are really comfortable and the fact that you can replace the cable makes them twice the awsome. please buy them"
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Except for the long connecting wire, these headphones work well in the gym. You need to wrap the long wire, and tape it, then keep in your gym shorts while exercising. After that, they work well. They do not get smelly or loose quality if worn frequently in the gym. And, the light weight design works well with any exercise. As for use as a studio headphone, maybe not so great. They keep out noise, but due to their design, do not have enough padding to keep out high level noise. Again, at the gym, that is good, so your buddy can get your attention.

My rating would be a two star if used by somebody serious in the music industry. For my use, it has worked just fine in the gym (except for the cable wire being too long.)"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been happy with these headphones in terms of sound quality and build quality. Other reviewers have talked plenty about the audio quality, so i won't repeat their sentiments. I have a big head and big ears. When i extend the headband to 9 (goes to 10 max) i get a good fit. So, someone with an even larger noggin could make these fit. I've personally tried on the 440 and 840 Shures. Lots of recommendations out there for 440 owners to upgrade to the 840 ear cups. Having tried both, i can see why. They don't look different, but feel more supple. Well, now there's another option. Shure recently came out with the SRH-940 head phones with velour pads. Having tried another pair of hedphones with that material, i was in comfort heaven. I did some digging between Amazon and the Shure web site and found that the 440, 840, and 940 can use the same ear cups. So, for $30 more, i'm now sporting $300 worth of comfort on $100 head phones. I think you'd be happy with either the 840 or 940 ear cups, but i really like the 940 velour pads. Super comfy and i don't feel sweaty wearing them for extended periods. I wear them at work. Helps me focus on my work while tuning out the rest of cubeville. My only regret is now i'm at home, cringing while using my cheap USB Logitech heaphones. Never knew how bad they were until i got some good headphones....

The headband on the 440's could use improvement. It may be padded, but still hurts my head a bit. I'm getting more used to it after a couple weeks, but i had hoped i wouldn't have to get used to anything. As much as i still like my SRH-440's, i'm really thinking of the 940 now. The headband design looks super comfy and i know i'll love the ear cups :)

Look for part HPAEC940. At the time of this review, Amazon did not carry this part, so i had to look elsewhere. I ended up ordering from the earplug superstore. What a nice bunch of people! I love ordering from Amazon, but since i had no choice this time, it was a smooth transaction and awesome service from them."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned this pair for about a year and a half my view has changed with time. Depending on usage, shelling out on a more expensive set of cans may provide a noticeable/necessary benefit. I used my set for gaming/listening to music/watching movies/in-flight. No doubt are they great value for money but they do have a few shortcomings

COMFORT
These are comfortable for short usages (1~2 hours). However any longer than that and strain applies to both the ear and the point of contact with the scalp. The ear cups clench with almost an excessive force which is great for isolating the sound however NOT so great for extended use. However the main problem is the build of the padded band or rather, lack thereof. Despite having a padded appearance, the edges are reinforced with a hard plastic inside the band which destroys any of the padded comforting effect. However, I must stress, this is ONLY noticeable after extended use.

BUILD QUALITY
Great at first... After a year the plastics squeak on the slightest movement. This is, however, only a minor issue as most of the sound flooding into your ears will drown out these noises.

SOUND QUALITY
Superb for the price point. Strong bass and crisp upper range. You need to spend a quite a few more large ones before you can find a noticeable difference.

ISOLATION
Due to the tight fit, the passive isolation is good.

SUMMARY
Although most of this review might seem harsh, these are issues that appear only after long periods of use and after over a year of usage. For the price point, it is hard to find a better set of around-the-ear headphones."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones three months ago after searching for a worthy replacement of my Sennheiser HD-205.
SRH440's sound quality is amazing. Thanks to their great damping, all external noises are isolated, and you hear nothing but high quality sounds. As their impedance is 44 Ohms and not 32 as the HD-205, the bass is not as deep, but I found it satisfying enough. I use them to play an electronic drum set and enjoy every moment.

Two major reasons for which I decided to purchased them are:
1. Their perfect isolation level. As one who works at a shared space, isolation is crucial to avoid distractions. I also enjoy it for hearing clean sounds without hearing my surroundings.
2. I can use them for hours straight. I'm easily irritated by headphones/earphones and this model was the first one I felt good about. For example, I couldn't use my Sennheiser for more than 30 minutes cause they extremely hurt my ears.

There are a few cons as always, but I still think they worth 5 stars:
1. There's no ventilation (obviously. they're isolating). My ears become really warm after an hour or two, but it's not unbearable.
2. The cable is a bit short, which I find inconvenient when I play the drums with them on.
3. They're weigh slightly more than the rest of the headphones I tried on."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones! But do know that if you buy these, you need to buy the replacement ear cushions (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z9JWZS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The difference after swapping the cushions was day and night. Not only was it significantly more comfortable, but the sound quality improved noticeably. The seal was better, blocking out sound and keeping sound in--the most noticeable change was with the bass.

The comparable headphone is the Audiotechnica ATH-M50, which many of my friends bought. It's a more popular choice, and it has better bass, but I personally prefer these headphones. They're cheaper, and with the new cushions it really has a nice, balanced bass. But not only that, my favorite part about these headphones is the bright sound--I absolutely LOVE it. You can't go wrong with these!"
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several backpacks and camera cases for every occasion. In the same way, I have headphones for different occasions and uses. I needed a good closed back set of headphones with good noise isolation properties and good quality audio sound stage. Although I don't consider myself to be an audiophile, I enjoy listening to music and what better way to listen than through a good set of headphones. So, based on the number of outstanding reviews, I decided to purchase the SRH 440 headphones.

First Impressions:
Well, when I got them the first thing I noticed was that these are pretty big. I used to own a set of Sony MDR V4 headphones and also considered buying a set of MDR V6 headphones which are considerably smaller. The SRH 440s are larger with circumaural ear cups that fit around your ears vice on them. The packaging case is made of very good quality cardboard and it comes with a soft carrying case and 1/4 inch adapter. The headphones have a nice heft to them, but could be exhausting over long periods of time. Unfortunately, when I first put them on, the ear cups and headband were the first things I noticed as being quite uncomfortable, especially for the price. But overall, my first impression was that these cans were of very good quality.

Sound: 5
I can't say enough about the sound from these headphones. They are simply fantastic. I was most impressed with the full presence of bass and the mid range, encompassing a nice, 3 dimensional sound stage. I mainly use my Sennheiser PX100s on my laptop and previously considered them to be outstanding primarily for their value for money, so when I compared these SRH440s, I was quite surprised at the great quality sound. There is no comparison between a full-sized, quality closed-back set of headphones and a portable open back set. The SRH 440s are simply outstanding, producing a rich and ever-present soundstage.

Comfort: 3
I found that these headphones were let down in the area of comfort primarily for the ear pads. If they would have come with the SRH 840 earpads, I think that I would have kept them. My first impression when I put them on was that they should be softer around the ear as well as having a more plush headband. They dug into my head and I had to make several adjustments to them before they felt a little better. I was expecting a more plush feel to them and I unexpectedly got a much more firm fit and actually found them a little uncomfortable at first. Even after listening to them for several hours, I found that the pads around the ears never got more comfortable over use.

Look and Feel: 4
These headphones are built with quality in mind and it shows in their look and feel. They fit quite nicely and notwithstanding the comments I made about the comfort, they feel quite good on my head. I suppose I could have sprung another $20 for the SRH 840 earpads, but then the price of these headphones would be encroaching the realm of the Audio Technical ATH M-50s, which are considered the top contender in closed back headphones. The SRH440s look a little big on the head and have a decent clamping force, thereby holding them firm to your ears. They look great and feel OK, but if they were to have come with the SRH 840 earpads, I think that I would have kept them. I called Sure and asked them if they would replace the pads or exchange them for the SRH 840 earpads, but they were not very accommodating and seemed to imply that I should have bought the SRH 840s in the first place.

Durability: 5
They are built very well and could probably stand the rigors of heavy studio and home use. The coiled cord is nice and thick and having removable is a very nice touch. The plastics used for these headphones are made of quality materials and I feel that they are quite durable indeed.

Overall, I was let down in the area of comfort. Especially in the ear pads and somewhat in the headband, which I felt a little pressure on the top of my head. For the price you're paying, you should expect comfortable headphones. For a little more money, I returned them and bought the ATH M50s instead and now couldn't be happier."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of a five year old pair of their in-ear headphones and now these no frills value leaders, Shure has just become my go to for headphones of any type. At $79 these are a no-brainer. Demoed these next to the $100 KRK 6400 and $150 KRK 8400 and while maybe not quite as flat, they certainly are more musical and therefore my pick for everyday listening. Team them up with an amp if you can, they still sound good straight from the iPod or computer. Very comfortable, well built and all that. Not as beautiful or stylish perhaps as AKGs, Beyers and the like but try getting sound like this for $79 elsewhere. Don't even consider Bose, you'll overpay for bad sound. Comes with a nice long coiled cable which can be replaced with their straight one for a little cash. Highly recommended unless you can afford the Beyerdynamic DT 880 at three times the price."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Sound great. There's pretty much nothing below 120hz, but I knew that going in. Their low-end sounds similar to the AKG K271, only with less chomp between 100-200hz. Still, their sound is enjoyable, and I think they will be useful for mixing.

Cons:
- Extremely, unbelievably uncomfortable. The ear cups are too shallow, the padding a insufficient. You can swap out the pads from the srh840/srh940 version for like $15-25, but supposedly that changes the sound, and not for the better.
- The creak when you move - no good for vocal tracking.
- My head might be a little on the small side, and the headband just fits at the smallest setting. If you've got a tiny head, these will be even less comfy. Headband also has insufficient padding, and is uncomfortable.

These could be decent headphones for <$60, but they are *not* worth $100. They feel cheap, they creak terribly, and are ridiculously painful to wear. I'm a bit insulted these list for $100, actually. You can buy a pair of AKG K271s for not much more, and they are *very* comfortable, especially the MKII model, which comes with the velour ear pads.

If you're going to spend $100 on headphones, you'd be better off spending it elsewhere, these are not worth it.

UPDATE: 11/05/15

Previously I was comparing these to my old AKG K270 headphones, which I don't currently have enough power to drive sufficiently, so I purchased the k271 mkII, which require less oomph to get them moving. Anyway, now I can definitely say that the SRH440 sound absolutely terrible in comparison. The SRH440 seems to have practically nothing below 200hz, and I think it starts to roll off even higher up. You can feel none of the bass, none of the kicks, whereas with the K271 mkII you can actually *feel* the bass, and not only the kicks, but the transients in general are sharp and potent, something entirely lacking in the SRH440, which sound like mush in comparison. No hyperbole here, the SRH440 sound dead and lifeless in comparison.

The stereo image on the K271 just blows the SRH440 out of the water, OMG, the SRH440 really do sound like mush in that aspect also. The clarity on the K271 models is astounding. The K271 is not known for its low-end response, it's actually anemic down there, but the low end *is there*, you can hear it, you can even feel it above 120hz. On the SRH440 it sounds like anything under 200hz is *absent*, just not even there. You can't feel it, fine, but you can't hear any of it either, it sounds like it's been abruptly cut off, no gently slope, just lopped right off.

Not to mention the K271 mkII are very comfortable -- if my k270 pair is any indication, you can wear them all day long and not incur *any* pain, whereas the SRH440 cannot be worn for mere minutes before becoming irritatingly painful. Also the SRH440 always fall off my head, where the K271 models do not. Actually, no circumaural headphones I have ever owned before have fell of my head like the SRH440 do, I do *not* know what their deal is.

I really wasn't expecting such a massive difference between the SRH440 and the K271 mkII. Yes, the K271 mkII are light and plasticky, but they still feel heaps more solid than the SRH440, which are embarrassingly cheap and crappy feeling.

The SRH440 are just a terrible buy for the price. These aren't worth more than $30 in my opinion."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my pair of SRH440's for almost a year now and even when I managed to break 'em I STILL love 'em.

My first motivation to buy these was when I saw a couple of music videos of performers that I really dig wearing them in the recording studio.

I'm a public radio disc jockey. When I'm at home, in our tiny little house, I usually listen to new music and DVDs over ""cans"" in order to not disturb my family. My 440's open up whole new sonic vistas. Now bear in mind, I use them with a pretty groovy integrated amp, but for my money these babies sound GREAT. I've had lots of good mid-range to audiophile ""cans"" over the years (Koss, Sony, Sennheiser) but these remain my faves.

And they take a LOT of physical abuse both at home and going back and forth to the station, where they have Sennheisers but I've gotten so addicted to my Shures that I take the trouble to lug them around. Heck, I even took them with me to the hospital when I had to go through six weeks of chemo. I would have to spend 5-6 hours in a recliner and these Shures just blotted out everything and were comfortable enough to stay under for LONG periods of time.

At home, they get trashed. (I have teenagers who are musicians, what can I say?) One night, I stepped right on them on the floor in the dark. POW- broke a piece of the headband unit. Sent them to Shure in Illinois for repair under warranty. They turned them around in 3 days (in house) no questions asked. Love it. And when the warranty runs out, some of the critical ""high wear"" parts (cable, earpieces) are user replaceable.

Just last night, I was watching the DVD of Johnny Depp in ""Rango"" It sounded awesome (highly recommended- great music) and made Depp's voice sound just AH-MAY-ZING.

And for the money? Can't beat 'em with a stick. ENORMOUS value. If you love challenging music, give yourself a treat and buy a pair of these beauties."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite pair of headphones ever, and I very much would like to give it 5 stars but unfortunately they broke on me after about 1 month of use. The sound quality is simply amazing and I haven't been able to replicate the same depth and quality on any other pair of headphones no matter how expensive. Unfortunately the plastic parts on these seem to break easily as one of the ears broke and is not hanging loose after just transporting them in my backpack with no bumps or anything.

It's a shame because I really wanted to like these and use it for much longer. Sadly I had left the country where I bought them and even though I contacted the store, they couldn't locate my receipt which is required to send in the headphones for the warranty I'm still thinking about sending them in for repair and hoping that it wont cost me as much as a new pair would."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"This will not be long and silly. It is exact and to the point. They work great. Extremey well built. The sound from these are not embellished ,but honest. I have used many head phones over the years, and these are pretty much great sounding phones. Nice lows but not a ghetto thumping boom and thump, clear mid range, and superb highs. One would be hard pressed to damage these things-that is how well built they are. They also fold up nice for travel, and have a detachable coiled cord which is very sturdy. If you want to spend more cash, well, I would suggest the 840's-I have a pair of them as well, but alas, they cost a tad more, however, in Shure, you get more. I had bought the 440 model and was very impressed and because of this I spent a few bucks more for the 840's. Both sets of phones are extremely confortable, and both sound best with ""break in time'."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,Im a club dj and have been doing 3-4 gigs a week for the past 10 years. This was my 3rd pair of headphones. I had 2 pairs of sony's before these but I forget the model. They were the silver dj headphones mdr700 or something. I wanted to switch it up and buy something different so I bought these. I used them in the same manner as my last two pairs of headphones and they crapped out after 11 months. They did not break but something crapped out in the cord where it meets the jack. They worked for about a month after the problem started and stopped working last weekend. I have used shure needles since I started djing so I figured these would be choice. Wrong! Im gonna try the sennheiser 280's next hopefully I have better luck with them.
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is very mediocre. Lack of punch and dynamics The overall build is very good but the exposed wire on each cup can become problematic. There Audio Technica ATH M40x is a better choice in this price category or the Status Audio CB-1 also come to mind as better and cheaper alternatives.

UPDATE

after breaking and using with a a good (non USB powered) Headphone amp, these opened up. I raise them to 4 stars"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought these headphones upon moving into dorms in college.

What I was expecting:
I am producing music, and that requires very accurate monitoring. I have my studio monitors, but since I live in a dense environment, sound is an issue. I bought these Shures because they are close-backed, neutral, and most importantly had good reviews.

What I got:
These cans are built very sturdily. You can literally feel the quality of it. It is also very conservative looking. It is for the most part comfortable, although it is NOT the most comfortable thing I have ever tried on. I think the ear cups are a little thin, but you probably can replace them with the 840 models'. I really like the coiled cord, since it makes storing it so easy and its just very convenient. The actual sound isolation is so-so in my opinion, nothing too great, but not too bad either. As for the sound quality, these cans were AMAZING! It allows you to hear every pin drop in your music, which I am very surprised considering its price range. Again, they are NEUTRAL, so if you are a hardcore bass head, you gotta crank up EQ or buy other headphones. However, I find these okay for listening (I listen to electro, house, trance) as long as you EQ.

The verdict:
Very very good bang for the $$. I am very happy with SHURE, as they live up to their name of legendary quality. These headphones are highly functional and durable, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into music production."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these 3 years ago. At the time, I got them for only $72. First off, these are very good headphones, especially for the price I paid. I find it pointless to try and describe specifics of sound quality to people on the internet, so I'm going to try to focus on other aspects of the headphones in this review. I'm going to touch on a few things I didn't like about them first.

- I did not like the coil cable. I've always had a hatred for coiled cables. Just a preference, not really a flaw since I know a lot of people like them. However, since the cable is removable, it can always be replaced with a straight one. I never cared enough to do that though.

- I found these uncomfortable, and that is the main reason I no longer use them. They mostly just felt tight around my head, and I couldn't wear them for long periods of time. For comparison, I also own an Astro A40 headset for gaming and a pair of Beats by Dre Studio headphones and both are much more comfortable to me.

- This wasn't a problem for me, but i didn't like how exposed the wires are that lead into the ear cups. It seemed like it would be easy for something to rip them out or cut them accidentally. It does come with a leather bag to store them in, so if you plan on being mobile with these, I would advise using it.

Sound quality wise, these are excellent and an overall great value. If this is would be your first pair of reference headphones, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal. I no longer use these, but I gave these to a friend of mine and he loves them too. If you've only ever used the awful ear buds that came with your phone, you will be very happy. Keep in mind, if you only have 128kbps songs on your computer, or primarily listen to music from YouTube, don't expect to be all that impressed. Bad quality music will only sound worse through these. It's a lot like watching standard definition programming on a 60"" LED HDTV and expecting it to look better because your TV is so good.

Also, I did buy a cheap amplifier after about a year of owning them and it did help out a little, especially since I like a little more bass in my music than these provide. Just remember, some people like these because of the mids and highs, and some people hate these for the lack of bass. Likewise, some people love Beats for their emphasis on lows, and some people hate them for their lack of quality mids and highs. It all comes down to what you want out of your music.

Are these worth $300? No. Are they worth $150? I think so. Are they worth the $72 I paid? Absolutely."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, yes, the headphones sound great, they are fairly comfortable (though the headband could be a little cushier--the top of my head starts to hurt after extended use)and aesthetically they can't be beat (Monster Beats... gross, gag me with a spoon) BUT--there is one downside that makes me wish I had returned my pair when I had the chance (no one's fault but my own, I know, I know, woe is me):

These things are creaky!! When you're wearing them, for example, with no music playing (why?? I don't know) you need only flex your jaw muscles, or tilt your head IN THE SLIGHTEST to hear the loud creaking of plastic, seemingly coming from where the can meets the headband (I'm just guessing at the appropriate terminology here).

Once I noticed it, I couldn't NOT notice it, even when listening to music loudly. The only way to avoid it is to keep your head completely still--which is not realistic, ESPECIALLY if you are hoping to walk somewhere while listening to music, which I like to do. Now, when walking, I find myself concentrating more on keeping my head stationary then on the music. Sorry Shure, these are some sexy headphones, but I can't recommend them."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't spent a lot of time with them, but the sound very good. I used them with some recording equipment and they sound clean. I also tried them with my HTC phone and they sound good with that as well, plenty of volume. I like the coiled cord and that is has both the 1/8"" and a 1/4"" jack adapter. As someone else reported the head band is a bit hard, not a bit deal, but that was the only thing I didn't like. Overall would buy again!"
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are comfortable and have great sound quality, but they are WEAK. I kept mine very delicately for almost two years now: never wore them in public, never twisted the sides, never put any unnecessary stress on them. Yesterday I turned the headphones around because one of my ears were sore, and doing this somehow caused the left ear part to completely break off. You cannot buy these headphones if you want them for long time use, which is sad as they have a great sound that I would like to recommend"
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"pros:
1. I love the clean even sound, these don't add base, they let you hear the audio as it is.
2. Some have said that these are too big to carry around. They are studio size, I bought them for recording and editing but I like them so much I take them everywhere, they fold up well and can take a beating. These go into my backpack and travel with me every day.
3. I love that the SRH440 parts can be purchased and replaced individually. I've had these for about two, maybe three years and the cushions are just now starting to crack a bit despite all my abuse. I will replace those for less than 20 bucks.

Cons:
1. Only con I can think of is that the protective bag that ships with these to enable you to transport them without harm is a little tight and inconvenient so I never use it, this is why the ear pads are getting a little rough. I noticed the 900 series has more of a shaped hard case. This would be ideal.

Summary:
I don't think you will find a better set of headphones within $120 of this price."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pair of headphones primarily on impulse, my Beats Solo had finally given out to poor use by a friend of mine and because I'm in college and speakers are not really an option considering my room layout. I felt it time, to invest in a new pair of headphones.
I did a small amount of research before I bought these headphones and I found that most reviewers found a nice clear sound with these headphones and I commonly found a very high comfort rating from these headphones. What I failed to see (or ignored) was the somewhat poor bass response these headphones give right out of the box. This wasn't a dealbreaker for me, it's simply the fact that most of the music I listen to is either bass driven or has a high emphasis on bass.
The build quality of these headphones is to be admired however. Aside from the exposed cable on the sides of the headphones, the build quality here is incredibly sturdy. It seems as though these headphones can survive a beating if need be, which considering that they are studio headphones, they really shouldn't be. The headband of these cans is made of a high quality metal I believe, and they are able to stretch to fit all size heads. My head is fairly big and I found myself forgetting that these headphones were even on.
The sound... The highs and mids are crisp and clear, without being harsh at all. The music surrounds you and I found sounds and instruments in songs I never knew were there. Songs actually became more beautiful through these headphones. Far better than the horrid muddy sounding beats I previously owned. However, out of the box, these headphones have ZERO bass, in some songs it's nearly non-existent. With a a few (50) hours of burn in the bass comes out of it's shell (somewhat) and the sound becomes fuller and more satisfying.
For anyone working in a studio, these headphones are a must, the sound reproduction from a quality source is excellent. Every aspect of the music is alive and prevalent, (aside from the bass) and the soundstage is decent for this level of headphones. An amp may be required, but my iphone drove these fairly well.

I would recommend these to those who work in a studio, or are not bassheads and are patient enough to burn in these headphones before forming an opinion on them. Very few headphones sound great out of the box."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously, I used and completely wore out a pair of Bose Headphones that were in the $110 range. The sound quality of those were very good, but the quality and workmanship were no match to these set of Shure Headphones. On the Bose, the cord is cheaply made and after some time, broke near the base of the headphone. It is permanently attached and once it broke at the thick plastic point of the unit, there was no fixing it. Basically, the entire unit was trash! Due to that issue and the poor workmanship, I will never buy another set of Bose Headphones.

Now for the Shure SRH440. Once I received the piece of equipment, I took it out of the box and was totally surprised at not only how well it was made, but I noticed there was not a cord attached (totally forgot about that in the description). I simply loved the fact the cord could be attached and removed at any time. Not only that, but there was an optional straight cord (I eventually purchased) that could be utilized. Again, the quality, compared to the Bose is unbelievable! The quality is much nicer; however, they are a bit more bulky which I truly do not mind.

Next was the true test,,,,, Sound! For the price coupled with everything I've already mentioned, the sound was Phenomenal... I seriously have not listened to so much music in my life. The base, highs and lows, etc... sound wonderful. Get these headphones, I promise, for the price, you will not be disappointed!!!"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first pair of high-quality over-ear headphones; I purchased them back in 2011, and they are still going strong. Like some other people, I bought the replacement SRH840 ear cushions to make them more comfortable, but the stock ear cushions aren't bad. One complaint that I have with these headphones is that wearing them for an extended period of time begins to hurt the top of my head, but that is probably just a problem with my own head. My skull comes to a weird point at the top, which is probably a result of banging my head too much as a kid (I got stitches up there even). You can probably assume that this won't be an issue for you people with normal heads.

The materials have held up well against being thrown around in a backpack every so often, but the cable that it comes with and its available replacements are pretty lack-luster. I am glad that the cable is replaceable since cables will always go bad, but these cables seem calculated to go bad and are impossible to repair. The wires inside are really thin. With such a thick cable housing, I would have expected better. I have attempted a few times when the cable starts to fail to open up the housing and solder the wires together to give it new life rather than spend $15-$20 for a new cable, but the wires are lined with some kind of nylon string that burns and prevents the solder from sticking, forcing you to only have the option of replacing the cable.

As for sound quality, I am still very much in love with the sound I get from these headphones. The longer I have them, the more I can pick up new details in the music I listen to. I can clearly pick up the singer's breathing, background instruments that were only used as fillers for color, and other nuances that make songs into a true music experience. There is plenty of room for the full frequency spectrum, but these will not rock your skull with booming bass. I would say that these headphones were designed for an accurate representation of the audio it is provided, which is why when you look at the frequency response charts that have been produced it has a fairly flat response across the audible range.

Listening to acoustic tracks is an amazing experience. The headphones faithfully reproduce the warmth of the tones of classical instruments, and if your recording is good enough to have captured the sounds the instrumentalist makes, you will hear all of those. Electronic music if fun to listen to, providing enough thump and hum for the lows while keeping the mids and trebles nice and clear. Vocals are nice and clean, and percussion is pleasantly tangible. Overall, these headphones are a great buy for someone looking for their first steps into real audio quality."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price and quality of these, it is hard to go wrong. If you are using them for more than a few hours in a row without any breaks you might want to consider something a little bit more comfortable. The audio quality is great, although after a few years of use I found the covering/wrap on the headband part started coming off on mine. I just bought another as a replacement as it was still a great offering given the price tag."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried going back and forth between these SHURE440's and my roommate's $100+ BOSE IE2, my sister and my dad's $300 BOSE QC 15, and my brother-in-law's top of the line BEATS BY DRE headphones that he uses for his DJ business. Here's how they compare (SHURE440 were my top pick)

BOSE IE2 were honestly slightly richer in mid tones, but less clear overall than SHURE440. SHURE440 sounds better, but are way way less portable, which can be annoying when I'm on the go. I like how these BOSE IE2s are not airtight--sounds open and certainly more comfortable, but still goes into your ear far enough to block out noise. Also, these BOSE have a microphone, in case youre using them for your phone.

BOSE QC 15 are wonderfully magical at muting the world around you and being a comfortable joy to have around my head. But because of the Noise Canceling, the sound quality is clouded. Sounds good/great, but still clouded. And these BOSE require a battery or two. SHURE440s don't. Again, SHURE440 sounds more clear and balanced, with a more open feel to the music. SHURE440's are significantly less comfortable, however, and do feel uncomfortable after a couple hours. But I care about sound, not comfort.

The BEATS BY DRE Studio $350 headphones sound great, too. But the sound is slightlyyy clouded by the emphasis on adding bass. SHURE440's sound VERY neutral and clear, and this was distinguishable, albeit by a minor margin. BEATS were more comfortable and of course are more fashionable, but I buy headphones--nicer ones especially--for the sound quality, not fashion.

-Don't get SHURE440's if you are on the go a lot. Get ear buds. They're easier to protect and pack quickly.
-SHURE440's high quality, detachable coiled cord is perfectly done, in my opinion. It is thick, and a more vulnerable part of headphones. It's great that it's replaceable, if such a high quality cord would break.
-The earpads are also replaceable, although after a couple years mine show zero signs of wear n tear.
-I used SHURE440's for playing Xbox and it's like cheating--I'd be playing people online in Call of Duty, and hear footsteps in the game around or behind me. I would stop, aim where they'd come from, then get the kill as soon as the person runs around the corner 15 feet away where the noise came from. Simply amazing.
-ON-THE-EAR headphones give better sound, but AROUND-THE-EAR headphones are needed by some to block out noise and to keep noise in. !!! ALSO, some people really hurt their hearing in the long run by using headphones that do not block out environment noise, so they compensate by turning the volume way higher. This is not healthy!!!

I'm really picky about my music. For me, there's nothing better than feeling like you are surrounded and immersed in clear music. SHURE440's gives VERY accurate sound, and won't exaggerate the bass, or hurt your ears with sharp high pitches. I like that. Other people might not, but I want to hear the details as the artist intended. Other headphones like the BOSE IE2 may bombard you with more full sounds, but the SHURE's are more precise and neutral. It depends on what you like. After HOURS and HOURS of comparing and reading reviews, and even since purchasing the SHURE's I continue to test the market. But I've found the SHURE440's to be the best around-the-ear, sub $100, durable and true sounding headphones."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a music producer and bought these headphones by recommendation from another producer. They sound great and have helped me step up my game. However I'll warn that mine ended up breaking. The headband snapped on the plastic extension when I was taking them off with one hand, not being rough or anything. Kind of disappointing. I was able to fix them with super glue but now they don't fit correctly anymore. Still usable but I feel like I can't wear them out in public anymore. I was surprised at how easily it snapped. Caution. Otherwise they've treated me well."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones produce amazingly clear sound. I'm hearing details in almost all of my songs that I'd never heard before, and I love that. The problem is that I can only enjoy the sound if I'm perfectly still, and ideally lying down. The perfectly-still part is because these things creak *terribly* every time I move my head even the tiniest amount. I'm not talking about full head turns, just the small adjustments as I look from one side of my computer screen to the other at work, or glance up as someone passes my cube. It's maddening. The lying-down part is because they do dig in right at the top of my head after an hour or so. I don't think I'm at all unusual in terms of head size/shape or amount of hair; it's just that the phones are too heavy to stay in place with lateral pressure (they'd crush your ears) so they have to rest slightly on top instead. Between these two factors, I love these headphones most of the time but absolutely loathe them sometimes too. The most frustrating part is how little it would take for Shure to fix both of these problems. A dollar's worth more metal in the hinges and padding on the top and these would be almost perfect. How could they come so close and miss?"
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality for the price. Mids are a tad lacking, but highs and lows are incredible. The bass isn't overkill like beats but its there and it definately is quite strong and you feel the rumble. Its painful to wear these headphones because the cups are shallow and your ears will press against the hard plastic unless you have very small ears that don't extend much from your head. There's really no cushion for the headband either. Buy the Shure 840 cushions for these for $15-20. They fit perfectly and my ears feel perfectly fine now. Comfort went from 1/5 stars to 4/5 stars. There's still no cushion for the headband so it still feels awkard on the top of my head."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,Tried it and sent it back.
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate good quality audio. I would never call myself an audiophile, but I appreciate good audio quality regardless. These are good. The lows are extremely *clear* and realistic; cheap bassy headphones might appeal more to a certain crowd, and they will give you more oomph, but in return you get muddyness down there (well, and in most frequencies really) and often a high frequency cutoff, whereas these go deep and aren't muddy anywhere. I'm really satisfied with the way these are set up.

They're also very comfortable. The pads are leather-covered and nice, though as with other leather-bound closed headphones your ears will get hot. You can make the set even more comfortable by buying replacement pads intended for the SRH-840, which fit the 440 just fine.

The headphones are solid. They're big and beefy, but they fold up nicely for travel. The included cable is thick enough, and it's also detachable so it can be replaced if it wears out for any reason. I'm a little concerned by the exposed wires on the outside of it, but I've had this set for more than three years and haven't had any problems yet."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones with great price, and even better sound. They will be very uncomfortable for some people, yet for some, they will be very comfortable. It all depends on your head and ear shape. If you have these headphones, upgrade to 880 pads and you'll get even better sound and greater comfort . ( A friend of mine did this to his 440s,and I borrowed them for comparison, so I know what I am talking about ) .
All in all, these are some really good headphones, and you should definitely check them out.

7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, i have a high standard when it comes to sound, and i was looking for a pair of studio headphones to use for mixing.

I love Shure, they are an american brand with high quality and when we americans buy something from them we know we get something for our money. And so with this headphones, the sound is definitly on the same level as headphones from other brands that costs $300 and more. For me it's very important to have a detailed and flat sound. A lot of other headphones are often overbassed. So even if the track is turned down to maybe a quarter of the rest of the song, the bass is still stronger than everything else. Not with this ones.
The bass just sits in the mix. when i eq it up it gets stronger and the other way around.

As well as nice highs, some headphones get ""scratchy"" highs, like some sennheisers, this ones are just great in displaying the full sound range.

Mids are as the rest just great, no mudding.

Shure delivers them with a detachable coiled cord and a carrying bag as well as an 1/4"" adapter.

One last thing, i use them with a headphone amp, just because it makes everything a little stronger and more clean. Though they also work fine with an ipod.

So to close this review, definitly BUY. You can't do anything wrong with these."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars," My overall thoughts on the headphones... Bass-Not as strong as I would like but has good thump, Highs-Good Highs!, Mids- Good Too! I give my full thoughts in the review video. The biggest thing I have to stress is that when I used them the headphones were heavy and the headband put constant pressure on my top head, this gave me headaches from time to time after long hours like say 3 hours... Also the earcups although they are over the ear, there was not enough space between your ear and the plastic housing. My ears would be pushed against the speaker which again after long hours it would hurt. Those were my two biggest gripes, aside from that the headphones are sturdy built and hold up its bargain for its price for sound. Disclaimer... Headaches from long hour USE"
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this headphone for a bit more than a year now, the best thing I've done is replace the hard stock ear pads with a set of 840 pads. They're a perfect fit and very comfy.
Overall sound quality is as good as it gets for the sub $100 price. For those wanting more bass, eq it.
Just bought a set of 940's, but my 60 year old ears can not discern any difference in sound quality.
I use to be a very critical listener, but not sure I was ever able to hear much of a difference in the 5-10Hz range or the 22-30k range.

Dollar for dollar the 440 w/840 pads is the way to go."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a bit of an audiophile who, after using Shure products for many years, decided to give these headphones a go to use for primarily listening to music around the house. Having used many higher end non-noise canceling over the ear phones, I must say that these are by far the best value for the price range. They sound great with just a flat EQ, and you can pretty much do anything you want with them with a little EQ tweaking in whatever program/mp3 player you use. The fit is comfortable, enough pressure to keep a nice seal over your ears, but not so tight as to make long listens uncomfortable. The only reason i give 4's for build quality and durability is because I had to send my first pair back to Shure because top cushion that connects to the frame became disconnected and eventually just fell apart. As per the usual, Shure owned that defect and kindly replaced them for no fee. My current pair is holding up fine; I'm assuming the first pair was a victim of quality control.. they are Shure's first attempt at over the earphones after all. Also, the headphone cord is detachable and easily replaceable, a feature that you usually only find on headphones of a much higher price. All in all, you really can't go wrong with these at this price. Thanks Shure!"
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are, at best, of average quality. I've owned mine for a couple of years now, mainly for tracking in a recording environment. They are touted as 'studio monitor', but that is just misleading. They are extremely coloured, and will flatter any sound you put through them. For that reason, they are only worthy of being called 'Hi-Fi' headphones, and should certainly never be used for mixing, where accuracy is an essential prerequisite.

The fragile cables leading to the cups are badly exposed, and one of mine has just broken due to being pinched by the hinge, so I'm going to have to perform a delicate repair job. The faux-leather ear-pads eventually crack up and look badly worn, even after only a bit of use. These headphones are very plasticky, causing a creaking when moving the head or jaw.

I expected much more for headphones of this price, but was deceived by misleading reviews. I've finally had enough, so will be replacing them with something better very soon soon, and they will not be made by Shure."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these headphones for many years, and they served me well. For the price, the sound quality is excellent. The reason to not leave a 5 star review is the construction. The piece that finally failed for me was the plastic just above the hinge. I was expecting the outer wire that connects the headphones to be the piece that broke first. They lasted 7 years of use, so overall, pretty durable, but they are a bit more delicate than I would have preferred."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio is clean in mid to high range however you will find it lacks in the low end range when it comes to lower quality audio. At higher bitrates the bass is accurate and clean but lacks the tight impacts you would expect when listening to some songs. The Shure SRH440 are however a well rounded design that performs.

Update: Using a Soundblaster recon3D PCIE makes these headphones shine and completely invalidates my previous argument. Make sure you are using it with the right equipment and they are worth every cent."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair from a local store last night and they will be returned today (I learned a valuable lesson last night:do not buy a new set of headphones without taking your old ones for reference!) I have to say ""ditto"" to the reviewer with the Sony MDR V6: I did a back to back and the Sony has such clearer highs, it's not funny. On the Shure, cymbals and other high frequencies sound ""muddy"" or ""muted"" to my ears. The Shure is much louder and has much more bass than the Sony MDR, but they really sacrificed the highs. Not as troubling but still noticeable is the Shure wear very tight on your head and the pads are uncomfortable. The Sony fit and sound better, their only drawback being the vinyl pads start to flake after a while."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SRH440 was my first venture into professional studio monitors. I have heard the sound quality on the Sennheiser HD555 , HD280 Pro, Beats Solo and Grado Labs' SR60i. The Beats have the best bass of the ones I heard but were atrocious for the mids and highs. The Grado's and Sennheisers are a little bit better than the SRH-440s accross the board but they are open design, which usually have a slightly better sound stage and reproduction of sound. The HD280 wasn't nearly as good in my opinion, but some people claim that the 280 Pro have better mids and highs.

Now with all that said you guys might wonder why I gave this pair a 5 star rating. Well simply put, this is the best closed, circumaural pair you can buy under $100. The sound quality is absolutely stunning. Make sure to burn them in for at least 100 hours and you will see a sharp rise in sound quality. I needed a pair that was good for indoor and outdoor use. It had to be closed, minimal leakage of sound, with a decent length detachable cable, no 10 foot cable like that of the 555. This pair does the job for me and its affordable enough that they are a great first step into the world of audiophiles. Again, its a great pair for casual listeners who want EXCELLENT build quality (these are heavy and very well built). I would highly recommend this product to broke audiophile wannabes (like me!) or casual listeners who want a solid pair of headphones with very good sound quality."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've use these in a professional Recording studio for about a year now, perfect for any genre what so ever. (I use them for Rock mostly.) I have gotten compliments from everyone that has tried mine.

Pros:
-LOUD
-Subwoofer is amazing.
-Crisp and clear like you wouldn't believe. Balanced perfectly and again. Bass is awesome for those certain pop songs...
-Makes Led Zeppelin seem like there performing in front of you :)
-Amazing. Simply amazing.
-Comfortable -- to a point.
-Noise-cancellation.

Cons:
-Wire is exposed on both ear, I haven't ripped it out accidentally yet but I take huge care of my headphones. (I can see someone doing it though.)
-The wire you can connect and disconnect going into the headphones after a while from people pulling on it (which I freak at) has stripped the plastic. But if you take good care and you are the only person using them you will not have this problem.
-Over about 3 hours of wear them, your ears begin to sweat because they sit tight to my head and get uncomfortable for me anytime past that... But usually I don't wear them that long anymore.

Overall 5 stars."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent headset for audio monitoring, and recording. They could be a tad fuller & richer though. So they are not the best for mixing as they don't match the sound of most speakers on playback. The ear pieces will sometimes flip around on you when handling, and can be a little cumbersome to get back around. You'll see 99 bucks on these at places like Guitar Center. Normally you can get a price match for the Amazon price of $73.50."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great.
I was looking for a set of good cans to go with my turntable, and collection of lps. For those days when I want to go loud... but the wife prefers to sleep.
I tried a couple other cheaper ones (samson ch700, and audio technica athm20), and I didn't like them. They sounded too ""electronical"" ( I don't know if that means anything to you), especially the voices. Decided to go a little up on the price, did some research, and these were recommended.
I just opened them, and the first record I listened was mike olfield's ""tubular bells"". It sounds wonderful. The music sounds alive. They have a very good bass response but it's not overwhelming the rest of the music, which I like. The level of detail, separation, depth, and width are just right for me. I also use a shure cartridge ( the popular m97xe), and they work very well together.
Ok, I haven't tried really expensive equipment, but if you're an ""amateur"" audiophile, like me, and are looking for some headphones to do the analog trick, while you're enjoying that comfortable chair, next to the turntable. I recommend these."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I want to say that I did some research before I bought these. I at first wanted AudioTechnica ATH-AD700s because of their soundstage, as I listen to a lot of atmospheric/ambient music and want to feel immersed in detailed sound. But after hearing so many people complain about their bass I finally caved, because if they're really tweaked to the point of having a less-than-natural amount of bass (according to a couple reviews I read) then I want nothing to do with them. I also have a tiny head. So I decided instead to visit my local dedicated audio store, Long & McQuaid. Their selection was weak, only a few to pick from. Among the ones that stood out were the HD 280s, the Beyer DT990 & 770, the ATH-M50, some HDJ Pioneer headphones and a separate section for Shure headphones and a bad pair of open-air headphones.

I mostly enjoyed the HD280s, but they sounded too warm, and it just didn't feel like a very impactful listen. The sounds didnt seem like they were coming from all around me, they just kind of happened in the left and right ear if you know what I mean. I still thought those were the best against the Beyers (bear in mind though the Beyers I tried had an impedance of 300 ohms or something crazy like that, so I obviously wasn't driving them properly, but I didnt want to go all out and get an amp yet so I decided against them. I bet they're sick though) I also decided against a pair of KRK KS8400s which didn't really blow me away, they made my music sound different to be honest.

Regardless, I was set on these HD280 s but then noticed the Shure line, on the shelf to the side... I saw the price tag on what were called ""Professional Studio or Recording Headphones"" or something like that, and they were only 99$!! Now I'm in Canada so that may be backwards for you Americans, but I was happy to see a pair of Shures looking that good for that cheap. So I tried them against the 280s. They blew the 280s out of the water.

I had heard good things about Shure headphones but for some reason this brand always seemed low end at first glance and turned me off and I never thought to try anything of theirs.. On the first listen, it's actually funny because I didn't realize it but I had my iphone's eq set to treble booster for my old Sony MDR-XB300, but the sound was still blowing my mind. I could pinpoint to you exactly where the instruments were coming from, i felt surrounded by the music. After I re-compared to the HD280s I was sure this was the best deal I was gonna get.

The sound is so absolutely clear. I was walking home and had to take my headphones off several times because birds were chirping in a song I had just bought but I could have SWORN they were real. The range on these is amazing. I can hear the highest possible frequencies and they feel so real that they sometimes feel like they're touching you or inside you or something... And the mids.. I was listening to female vocals, and it sounded like I was the one doing the vibrato, you can almost feel the vocals. It's crazy how real these headphones make music. It comes alive. You're fully immersed in every song. And you don't have to worry about coloration or EQ, these cans reproduce sound beautifully, There's no emphasis on the bass and this is an absolute blessing. The bass is deep, detailed, certainly not modest or lacking in any way shape or form because after trying out a few pairs I've learned that bass is something that is kind of important to me and these give me exactly what I want, detailed bass reproduction without it stealing the show. These continue to blow my mind during break-in, the bass is getting both deeper and fuller. A genre that really makes these headphones shine is classical. I feel like I'm watching the whole thing from the conductor's perspective. I could almost see the person playing the instrument. I love it when sound becomes almost hallucinogenic, I crave this in sound and I love that these headphones make listening to music such an experience. This is not an exaggeration either as you can tell from the other reviews. This may be expected from a professional studio pair, but for listening of all types, ambient, rock, pop, dance, dubstep, especially classical, these are your best bet for under $100. In fact they're a steal at this price. No bs phone.

With regards to comfort, my only complaint is that after 6 hours of listening, my ears started to hurt. I had to take them off for a few minutes and then put them back on a different way to ease the pain. But other than that I barely notice them. They're big but subtle. They're also very durable and their sound and look have a similar quality: they don't mess around. The pads are super comfortable and block out sound just enough to be immersed in the song, but still slightly connected to reality. The headband is very comfy and listening to these for long hours is not a pain but a pleasure, like I said only after about six hours of listening did I start to experience some discomfort.

The 440s are extremely portable. They work amazingly on my iPhone, their impedance is 40 ohms so I bet they sound great through an amp too. They fold up like the beats do and include a bag which I thought was a nice touch for $100. It's already sick that they fold for $100 without being poor sound quality if you think about it haha.

I've used some, albeit mainstream, pretty good headphones, Monster Turbine Pro 24K gold edition, heartbeats, Bose in-ears, monster mobile jamz, and I have to say by far these have impressed me the most overall, whether in sound quality, value, durability, comfort, etc. Even in portability because these fold you're really not missing much.

This is an incredibly solid purchase. Fantastic soundstage, fantastic positioning, fantastic reproduction, no coloration, lifelike sound, extreme comfort, crazy durability (to prevent shorts, theres a plug-in under the left earpiece for the rest of the cord which is awesome! The cord is kind of retro because it stretches like the old home telephone cords, but again, this just gives you that ""this cord doesn't mess around either"" feeling which is how I feel about these headphones.

They're amazing, and definitely worth more than the asking price!"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"The SHURE SRH 440 are the most uncomfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn. I though that since SHURE is a great brand for microphones their headphones would be good. I was very wrong.

Because of their light weight (supposed bonus), the pads on the headphones slide down causing the top ridge to dig into my head. I can't wear these for more than 15 minutes because the top of my head starts hurting. The phones themselves are protected by hard plastic, which starts hurting my ears 15 minutes into the session. After 2 weeks, I am frustrated and am looking to sell them because I will not be using them again."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've own a pair of these headphones for about 2 years now and they are still performing perfectly. In fact, i think they have gotten better with use. They have a very clear sound, great highs and mids, while the bass certainly isn't for those who like it in excess. My only complaint is that they aren't the most comfortable headphone I've ever worn. I have ears that are a little on the larger size, and sometimes it feels like my ears are touching the inside of the headphone and it hurts after a while. When compared to my bose, there is no comparison, unfortunately those are now broken. But, the over-all quality of these headphones has a hard time being bested for the price."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great flat sounding headphones for mixing. BAD building material as far as the plastic extender bars on the sides.

3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,these heaphones are cheaply made and after ony 1 year the plastic hinges that allow adjusting the headphones are cheaply made of plastic instead of metal and both sides are broken making the headphones useless .
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the SRH 440's after my Sennie 280's broke down due to cracks in the headband (I have a large head), and I suggest you need search no more for decent headphones at an excellent value; first, let me say the SRH 440's are a much better fit if one has a larger head or dislikes the tight fit of Sennheisers.
I did not burn the 440's in, but rather started listening to them right out of the box. I listen to a variety of music from classic rock, metal, progressive (basically most music except trance and rap). The SRH 440's provide a equalized or balanced sound in my opinion as far as levels for highs, mids, and lows whether I listen to Pink Floyd, Metallica, or Tool. Again, I am not a big dependent of thumping bass, but the SRH 440's do provide a decent enough thump. For the 200 dollar and below range, the SRH 440's are a great set of cans and excellent value."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"This just arrived last week and didn't need to burn it much..Excellent sound stage..bass is slowly improving. this is definitely a good balanced headset. bass is not a great feature, but it is crisp.

6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe it's just me but these sound identical to the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x I honestly couldn't tell the difference and these are much cheaper.

There's much more serious problem with these headphones - you cannot wear them more for than four hours. Top of your head will start hurting a lot.

I would've definitely bought some other model, had I known this in advance."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phones are as good as any other at this price. The problem is with the materials and design: when the foam pads come off, they are extremely difficult to put back on. Also, they don't travel well.

The negative reviews about comfort do have some truth, but this is not a huge deal. For me they fit great and don't press in on my ears.

6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to my Sennheiser HD280 cans, these don't sound as good to me. Maybe it's just because I've used the HD280s as my primary set for 5 years now. Other than that, they are super-comfortable (to be fair, I upgraded to the memory-foam ear pads that go with the SRH840s) and the design is awesome. For YEARS I have been annoyed that headphones were the only pro audio gear around that didn't have detachable cables and VOILA! Shure impresses me again. Nice job. I've had these only a few hours, but have been jamming on them all afternoon :)"
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for about 2 years now, and decided to write a review after the SECOND of the earpieces broke apart from the housing. The joint holding the left earpiece literally crumbled one day, about a year into use. All I did was pick up the phones off of my desk. The joint literally split apart into crumb-sized pieces. Frustrated over repeatedly having the buy headphones and not having them last, I just decided to hang onto them, seeing as how I do alot of one-ear work while voicing at the microphone. Well, just today, about a year after the first shattering, the right earpiece suffered the same fate. Is it summer humidity? I've no idea. But something is seriously wrong with the long-term durability of the headphones, and I have no intention of buying another Shure. The sound of the phones was very good, however, better than the Sony's I had previously. While they lasted at least."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for a surprise birthday present (I didn't even know what Shure's were until now) and right out of the box there amazing... Every style is absolutley clear in every way, especially the drums and bass! Amazing is all I can say... You add a bass booster to them and some techno music... Holy crap I was levitating... You play Zeppelin, Jimmy's guitar sings like its never been heard before... You play anything, your guaranteed to love them!"
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this item a week or so ago. The sound is fine, as is the build quality - but:

1. The headphone is a very, very tight fit (I have a normal size head). My ears sting after a half-hour or so of use.

2. The thin wires on the headphone itself (not the cable leading to the input device) are looped and jut out, just waiting to be ripped apart by an unintended snag on your finger or something else. I had to wrap the headphone on each side with plastic and wind tape around the plastic in order to conceal and thus protect the wiring. It looks terrible and requires an explanation every time someone sees the headphone.

You are not going to be satisfied with this item."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these when I lived in a country with a limited selection. No HD 280 Pro, no Sony 7506, no A-T 50, etc.

They're not bad, but I got back to the USA, heard the 280s. To me, they obliterate the 440s -- for sound and build quality.

The Shures do feel a little on the cheap and flimsy side."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones as a gift back in November of 2013, not even 6 months ago (from when this was written) and these sound FANTASTIC, almost IDENTICAL to the Sony MDR-7506, however the build is FAR worse.
All I did was pick them up (no I don't abuse them) and the ENTIRE left ear cup housing crumbles. Don't buy these. Get the 7506."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,They are average for this price point. Bought primarily to check mixes and jam with amp sims. They are meh.
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I have HD 600 and HE 500 and these for the price are pretty good
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these about 3-4 years ago. I have a home based studio and needed something with an accurate frequency response. Was pretty happy with them until the right speaker went out. Im very careful with my equipment so i honestly don't understand why this happened so soon. Is it wrong to expect something you buy to last at least five years? I have a low tolerance for stuff that breaks so easily. Not sure if I'll be buying any more headphones from Shure.
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good Item
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,Solid pair of headphones. Three stars because they aren't that comfortable in my opinion.
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I compared these with super expensive and fancy, wireless headphones. These are way better, and there is no need to charge or anything. They sound great, they feel great, I love them!"
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this headphones at the office. They mask the majority of outside noises, so that I can get work done. BUT. The slightest movement of my jaw or head results in extremely loud plastic creaking sounds. Don't eat, chew gum, don't turn your head, don't move, and these are amazing."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really comfortable and sound great at all volumes and frequencies. The only thing I've encountered with them is that after about a year or so of use, the attachments of the ear cup to the band across the head start to break, so be really really careful with that area!"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update Nov 2012--- recently got another replacement headphone (#5 I think, I've lost track). Used about 4 wearings and I simply placed my hand on the headband and pulled the headphones forward off my head and the right earphone assembly broke off. Little piece of hard black plastic were on the floor. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! They are all defective. These are as bad as the ECCO Shoes debacle! Shame on these companies for not owning up to defective merchandise.

The sound of these is excellent, the blocking of outside sounds in also excellent, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW. I now see why they come with a long warranty as I have now had 3 pairs and each pair breaks at the pivoting hinge on ear piece. Yes they replace them, but each time I have to waste my time filling out the return form, boxing them up and paying some $8 - $10 to ship back. I am now boxing up my 3rd pair. When is this going to end? It is not like we have big heads nor are we rough with them. Always used in same location, we place them in a shoe box rather than draper over any thing to avoided the heavy ear piece from popping off again. They should have used a non-cracking plastic with fibers in it to prevent this repeated malfunction. I would suggest getting the Sennheiser version of these online for about same price."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,these r really great headphones! im in tha studio alot and these really help me out when i want to cancel out outside noise from other places or people.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SRH440 provides great response for recording. Performance, value, durability, all great. Little fatiguey on the ears after hours of use but we all need time out for a little while. I recommend this headphones for home recording."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great. Could be more comfortable, they feel a little tight. The only problem I have is with the cord. I don't like how it's all curled up, makes hard to walk around with. Otherwise, they're amazing."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at work to listen to music and isolate myself from surrounding noise. I bought them to replace a broken pair of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's, and after reading reviews these are supposed to have better sound. After using these for a couple of weeks I find them uncomfortable to wear for even a few minutes. The foam padding is lacking and too hard. The sound isolation is poor because they don't seem to grip my head very well. If I put the hood from my sweatshirt up and wear the headphones over them, they're acceptably comfortable and the isolation is better, but I wish I'd just bought a new pair of HD 280's."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY THE SHURE 440's you can do better.

THE EAR PADS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE, this really gripes me Shure has perfectly suitable pads on their 840's that will fit perfectly on these, WHY DON""T THEY PUT THEM ON Everyone complains about the pads on the 440's. My point they have the right pads in inventory and you have to spend $20 to get them, STUPID.

How do they sound,GOOD, they sound GOOD thats it, they bottle you up kind of like putting your head under water but they do isolate you. The sound stage suffers a little it is right or left not much depth, the head band is lousy it flops around on your head if your not sitting still and the worst - there are these unsightly, poor designed little wires sticking out right above the cups that loop and will catch on everything, they have been placed perfectly to ruin your day.

Are they worth $100 plus $20 for new pads, ABSOLUTELY NOT, DON'T BUY THESE.

Here is my recommendation. Either outright buy the Sennheiser MD 595's for $259 OR here's the real deal- Sennheiser sells so many 595's they must have a bunch of refurbished, or what they call B stock phones. Amazon usually has these just look below the new price on the page for refurbished, if you can't find them there do a search on 595's refurbished. I have purchased 4 sets of these so called refurbished phones for about $120 each over the years. Every set has arrived in the original box, appeared unopened/unused and had the new headphone sharp sound that goes away starting the first 15 minutes of use to 20 hours when it's about completely gone. They have been just like the ""new"" ones. I think in most cases they are the new ones, if by chance you get bad ones send em back and try again that's easy.

DO NOT BUY THE SHURE 440's they sound OK but you can do better. Sennheiser HD 595's"
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have excellent sound quality. There is no doubt. I've owned them for about a year and they have not ceased to amaze me. HOWEVER, there is something you need to know. This is the reason I write the review: These cans are extremely uncomfortable. The padding is quite thin in comparison to most over ear headphones. As a result, my ears make contact with the plastic that is in place to protect the speakers. If I wear these phones for more than 10 minutes I experience literal pain. I say this because I care about you. I really want to warn you. So please, before purchasing these find a way to try them out for a while.

Before you make up your mind please take a look at the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. I recently purchased these headphones. They are better in every aspect. They block 32 dB of noise. Very comfortable and snug. Sound wonderful. Read the reviews.

The reason I give this product five stars is because I find that people tend not to read one star reviews about products the want to buy ha. Anyways, please take it into consideration. Thank you!"
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is an excellent example of why we should wait before writing a review. During my first year of ownership, I would have rated this headphone as four or five stars. The audio is very good. They appear to be a bargain. Wonderful fit and comfort. Excellent all around. Better sound starts at double the cost.

The only indicator of the problems to come was the discreet ""made in China"" label. After one year, the left side above the earpiece shattered. Under warranty, it was quickly replaced by Shure. After 11 months of use, the replacement shattered in exactly the same way. Before anyone accuses me of pulling the headphones out too far when taking them off, I should note that I have used a pair of Sony V6 headphones in the same way far more heavily each day for over 20 years with no similar failures. In fact, I have had no similar failure on any of the other headphones that I have used.

I predict that the warranty replacement headphones will also last about a year, but the warranty will have expired by the time they break again. The good part about the next failure being predictable is that I have a year to research the replacement for the Shure 440s.

UPDATE: Marked down from two stars to one star. In my original review, I predicted another failure, the left side shattering, within one year. In this, the Shure fully met expectations. They successfully achieved failure after only nine months. I have never had this problem with over a dozen other headphones that I have used long-term. The product is now out of warranty and headed to the trash."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a gift. The recipient liked it. :) He said to give it five stars, so there you go."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just like all the other one and two star reviews, the left ear piece just broke off after normal handling and it's time for the garbage. As I found my tiny sony earbuds to be more useful than these heavy monsters, I certainly won't be replacing them."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy to announce that Shure now offers a straight cord for their SRH440 headphones. The part number is HPASCA1.
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Flat audio output, so no artificial boosting of bass or treble ensures that I know what I'm hearing is accurate. Threaded 1/4"" adapter, comfortable for long periods. The soft case is well built and has a nice feel, but I feel like I might have preferred a hard case. Sturdy, coiled, locking detachable cable means no accidentally yanking the cable out while moving around.

Cons:
Not a fan of the 2.5mm proprietary jack to hook the cable up to the headphones. This means I can only use the cable that came with, and should something happen to that I'm up a very lonely creek.
I have to disconnect the cable to fold them up all the way. This could have been remedied by a little extra design work on the folding bits, but I guess this way means some extra protection from damage to the jack while transporting.
I do worry a bit about the longevity of the wires. Instead of being routed through the headband all the way, they stick out at the points where the headband is adjustable, and they could get snagged on something.

Other thoughts:
There's no active noise cancellation, but they create a nice enough seal around the ears that it doesn't become necessary. Passive cancellation also means I won't hear any inaccurate sound pickup while recording. I've had active sets that actually scrub out the signal coming through the wire because it's the same waveform as the outside noise. That is not a good attribute when trying to find the best mic placement.

The only time I've had bad audio from these is plugging into my laptop. But I'd excuse even that, since laptops have notoriously noisy signal from the headphone jacks. When I'm at home, I run an HDMI out to my TV anyway and have that decode the audio. Gives me a cleaner signal and I can edit my audio way better.

Bottom line:
It's the best deal I've seen for professional studio-quality headphones. This is a set for those looking for accurate audio representation, not music fans looking for orgasmic bass response. Given that, though, I still hear nuances in my music that I hadn't been hearing before."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, and much cheaper alternative to big name brand headphones. Have the same noise canceling and sound quality as similar Bose and Beats headphones. Another plus is the replaceable ear pads if they get old/flat/nasty over time."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been a long time since I have purchased full-sized, closed headphones. After reading a couple of web-based reviews, I chose these SRH440s with the final factor being the awesome deal that Amazon was running at the time with the Sarjo Wholesale Group. These are very comfortable, all round, circumaural headphones. Bass is controlled, but sufficient. Mids are slightly recessed, but lively and highs are clear and vibrant. Overall, it's a nicely balanced and very fun sound presentation in a typical, closed-headphone kind of way. While I listen to all types of music, the only genre I can't really recommend for the phones is classical. Classical music needs a more spacious presentation than these closed cans provide. They are great with rock, electronic, jazz and country, though!"
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound is beautiful on these headphones, I find that they ""creak"" a lot when my head moves. I can't find a position where this does not happen. I wish I could cure this problem, because the sound is really great - very clear, excellent highs and bass is good without boost."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for about 3 months, and I can say wow. These have amazing fidelity, I believe that these are pretty good for headphones under $100, even though I bought mine for more than that. My only complaints are:
- Comfort is an issue
- Not much representation of bass
Pros:
- Good for mastering acoustic inputs
- Flat response
- Amazing hi's and mid's
- Detachable headphone cord

Although I know that these are not able to replace large studio monitors, I thought they would at least come very close, and they do. But since these don't have that much bass, it is hard to accurately raise or lower the volume. These cans are also not the most comfortable studio headphones you can find, pressure irritated the top of my head as well as the outer part of my ears. Build quality is solid, and the fact that the headphone cable (input) can detach from the headphone.
As a home recording studio guy, these headphones have almost no sound leakage whatsoever, and they don't move around too much if one moves their head. These are great for making music, recording vocals, even listening to music from your ipod, although I did mention that these are not the most comfortable headphones. Believe the telemarketing crap for these headphones, they have AMAZING high frequencies. These are probably best for mastering vocals and acoustic instruments, perhaps not for techno stuff, since lows are not that loud. These are very flat headphones, great if space or neighbors are issues. If not, then invest in some studio monitors instead, either way, your not throwing your money away."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great turn around time from the time of purchase. Product was exactly as described. My husband is a drummer and these are perfect for him to be able to drum and still hear the music he's playing along with. I love that it comes with a case because they won't get damaged.
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is excellent and the headphones fit comfortably--at first. There is enough weight on the headphones to make one's scalp hurt uncomfortably if one wears them for more than an hour or two. They would probably be excellent for short-term use, but I wanted headphones to use for many hours at a time. One can shift the position of the headband and adjust the height of the headband but then the new position starts to be uncomfortable. I ended up giving these headphones away."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. If you're looking for phones with extraordinary bass then you probably won't be satisfied. The bass in songs is there as it should be, but there's no enhancement like you'll see in more popular commercial brands.

Like others have mentioned, I too had cracked/broken hinges within 3 months of purchase. I mailed them in and was given a new pair - great customer service."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great headset to pick up when it's on sale for those of you who like to mix/produce/or as an input for a guitar. The sound is the epitomy of ""neutral"". No boomy bass or incredible highs, it's across the board flat which is great if you are designing your newest tune. However, I have a medium size head and after 1-2 hours of wear it hurts and is quite uncomfortable around the ears and temples.

Haven't had any issues with the cord or input at all.

Would not recommend if you're looking for an everyday set of cans for your iPod on the go. Requires and amp/soundcard/good source to really get you're money's worth. Look to other models or brands for an on-the-go type."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I depend on others reviews so I will try to provide some objective data here to help. I try hard to sort through the reviews that are obviously ""bandwagon"" fans or uninformed opinions that don't concur with the rest of the data so that is why I wanted to post my experience with these headphones.

I purchased these at a friends recommendation that Shure makes a very good product. Reviews seemed to concur so I went ahead. I let thee ""burn in"" overnight as suggested by other reviewers when I received them. I played these from my computer at work, my mp3 player and my home laptop all with the EQ set to flat to determine if any of my issues were source related. Audio was both ripped mp3 and streaming audio from Spotify. I am by no means an audiophile, I just enjoy music. I had three reasons for this purchase: 1) help me focus at work. I am an engineer in a noisy cube farm. 2) travel - work has me on airplanes a few times a year. 3) Replace my creaking Acoustic Research headphones.

Pros:
- comfortable
- blocks out more ambient noise than most. (not isolating or canceling) I was most impressed by this attribute.
- very crisp and clear sound
- removable cable locks in quickly
- cable goes to only one side

Cons:
- small wires that go around hinge for each earphone made me constantly nervous whenever I handled them
- bass is very week. no kick drum in rock songs and no real bass in rap songs.
- although comfortable and sound blocking, they slip forward or back relatively easy when your head moves
- They CREAK. This is my biggest complaint and actually the very reason I purchased them. My A/R noise canceling headphones creak and it drives me nuts. Movement, especially chewing, causes the plastic joints to creak and this is very noticeable.
- Bag / pouch is extremely generic

Other:
- Cord seems durable but is very heavy due to the spiral
- Construction seems more generic than I expected.

Summary:
Sound isolating quality creates a very nice listening environment and allows for lower listening volumes. Sound is very crisp and clear. A bit too much High (high frequencies - high hat, tinny sounds) and not enough lows (no low end reverb on bass guitar or kick drum in Rock). The lack of low frequencies and the creaking led me to return these in search of something more suited to my tastes. I won't bad mouth these but can't recommend them to everyone.

Hope this helps. Good luck!"
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this for my son because my husband, who is a musician and music teacher, really enjoys his. He likes the bass he is able to hear in it and clear in sound. My son enjoyed them too for his gaming and listening to music. We bought it when he was 15. He is now 16. They did not last more then a year, because he is very hard on his headphones. My husband has had his for the last few years and they are in good shape. I wouldn't recommend them for someone who is hard on his things. However, if you treat your items well, these should last you a long time."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't go into too much detail; better reviewers than me have done that throughly already. Here's my quick list of pros and cons:

Pros:

- Awesome sound. Really well balanced pair of cans.
- Unbeatable price.
- Decent isolation.
- Hardly any sound leakage.
- Detachable cord is a massive win. All headphones should have this feature, in my opinion.
- Coiled cable, doesn't tangle as easily and takes much less space than a regular cable.

Cons:

- Headband gets very uncomfortable after 1 or 2 hours. It has hardly any padding at all on top, so be sure to grow your hair long to add some more padding.
- It clamps to your head a bit too hard. After long sessions (6 hours or longer) I get a bit of a headache.

All in all, I think these are a great buy. I've had these for less than a month, so the jury is still out in the comfort area; as with anything you wear, a break in period is to be expected."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounded great and lasted just about 25 months before they broke. I have no idea why, but the hinge part of the headphone cracked where it goes into the upper headband. I'm pretty hard on headphones so maybe it was just time. I would buy again, but decided to try something different."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were purchased for use during filmmaking and video editing. The around the ear and closed back design makes them perfect for cutting out background noise so you can hear all the detail they deliver. Fantastic value for the price. Preferred over the similar Sony model.
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite what some say, these are quite comfortable and don't slip. They are closed and do not sound as good as open headphones...my Seenheiser HD600's sound much better but they cost 4 times as much and are harder to drive. I use the Shure's with my Ipad and they are great for that. For serious listening I use the Senn's hooked up to my headphone amp which is connected to my stereo system. But these Shure's are good for portable devices.....of course if you want the bloated bass of some of the more popular headphones you will be disappointed."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. Compared to my Beats.. This is the same quality for much cheaper price and hell a lot lighter than Beats on my head. After half an hour of wearing Beats, Inusually get headaches because its heavy, but with this Shure headphones, I can listen to music for hours, so comfortable to wear and the sound is just as amazing or even better than Beats."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not happy with the bass on these headphones. If you listen to hip hop, electronic, or anything that pronounces bass, don't get these. Otherwise, the sound is great. I wear them at work when I am trying to concentrate, and they completely drown out office noises at a relatively low volume.

The 1/8th inch side of the cable came bent, and I had to spend money to ship it back for warranty replacement. Unfortunately the side that connects to the headphone is a small non-standard size, so you can't really find these cables anywhere else."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Why 4/5 stars? The were blown after 9-ish months, now it crackles and bass doesn't sound nearly as good.

Being that they blew so fast its hard for me to recommend these headphones to someone, but they did sound Great while they lasted. If you listen to bass heavy music ( Hip hop/rap or Electronic ) I would recommend something else, as these have a mild bass hit, but the bass note sounded clean. you can always use and equalizer to bump it up but it is easy to overwhelm them."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"theses headphones are just great. ive had alot of headphones...i have the beats by dre studios and compared with these..pick these if you want your audio to sound clear! Now these don't have alot of base..these are not for people who want alot of base.. because i have noticed that the beats by dre have too much where you can barely hear the highs and lows. the shure srh 440s are good if you wont to use them for recording in the studio because the isolation on these headphones are far better then the beats by dre.. because i have noticed the beats by dre leaks the sound into your microphone then when you play it back you may hear some of the song in your vocals. Now the comfort on the headphones are pretty good they fit well on your head.. it also depends on what type of head you have as well.. but i would give the comfort on these headphones any where between a 8-9. i was expecting a little more from these headphones but overall they are goood quality headphones. for the most part they are sturdy they dont feel cheap just a all around good headphone. the only thing that may be a problem is the coil cord but you can always buy another cord if you dont like the coil cord but even though it can go pretty far for the length.

and again if your a person that wants to hear your music clear with not too much base then these maybe the headphones for you but if you want alot of base this may not be the headphones for you"
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for use with mixing live audio, recorded audio and using them as a guitar monitor. I also wear them at work from time to time to listen to music. I also wanted something that didn't squeeze my head and give me a headache, and in-ear phones weren't an option since they always make my ears hurt as well.

As far as I can tell these Shure 440s are the best bang for your buck. They seem to be much higher quality than the comparably priced Sennheisers I was looking at. The only thing that worries me is the external wire to each ear piece. I have almost snagged it a few times putting them away. I love the little bag they come in, it's great.

I haven't had these all that long yet, and I know alot of people say to burn them in, but I think they sound pretty good over all. I could go for just a little more bass in my music, but overall the balance is very good.

These phones are comfortable for the most part, they don't squeeze your head too much, but that also requires you to wear them directly over your head. This usually pulls my hair after awhile and does cause some discomfort, but not nearly as bad as some others do. The earcups are very comfortable and while they look to be too small to cover my big ears, they do it quite nicely! The material on the earpiece itself is very soft and doesn't feel like cheap vinyl."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm something of a headphone junkie and I've bought a lot of different headphones over the years. Denon AH-950 and AH-D1000, the venerable Sony V6, Audio Technica ATH-AD700, AKG K240, Grado SR-80... all of them have their positives, and they're all solid choices balancing sound quality, cost, and overall value. The Shure SRH-440s are better than all of them, and at a price that makes picking up a pair a no-brainer. They sound incredible - not just compared to similarly priced headphones, but to any headphone I've ever heard. They're tough - I've taken my pair around the world and back, and they're holding up remarkably well. They're reasonably comfortably too - they've got a bit of heft to them and they hold on to your head, but I prefer that. I did replace the earpads with the pads intended for the SRH-840, and that made a comfortable headset even better. I can't recommend the Shure SRH-440 headphones enough."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own both Shure SRH440 and Sony MDR-V6. Other people's comments helped me so I hope mine help you decided between the two. For the money, I would go with Sony MDR-V6. You can't go wrong, for the price point it's worth the money. Nothing to complain about, great sound, comfortable, light weight. The coil attached to the left ear cup can be heavy at times but this is the issue with all the coil cable headphones. When folded, it is pretty small and easy to transport. If you think you are bass inclined, just go with V6.

Now for Shure440 - personally I like the sound of this headphone better. Caveat: I replaced mine with Shure880's earpads. I highly recommend getting the replacement if you are going to spend money buying 440. It makes a substantial difference, much more comfortable and sounds better in my opinion. Shure440 separates sound better and has better sound stage. It has a bright warm tone that I personally like. To my ear, it is more neutral than the V6 - meaning it doesn't really emphasize anything versus the V6 seems to have a slight emphasis on the bass. One more thing to complain about besides the stock earpads is the weight. It's solidly built but a little heavy - for a long period of listening you will definitely wish it is lighter like MDR-V6.

Both are very good headphones - if you do enough research you will find that these 2 comes up a lot as good headphones for under $100 price point. Each have their own personality and sound signature. I wouldn't say they are similar at all. I keep MDR-V6 at work and the 440 for home listening."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I must admit this is the most pleasant surprise I've had in a long time ordering something based solely on revues without actually having the product tangible for my own personal inspection. The Shure SRH440 headphones perform far better than I would have imagined, and replacing my old headphones would have been done a long time ago had I known the audio quality of these headphones is as good as it sounds!

For those who familiar with the following equipment I'll describe my experience. I'm a musical composer using a Roland Fantom X-8 Workstation, and a Roland 1680 16 track dedicated digital recorder with Roland DS-90A powered near field monitors. Until I purchased the SRH440 headphones I primarily relied on the monitors for sound, and would use my other headphones only to avoid waking others in the house during late night/early morning composing and recording.

However, the sound quality of the SRH440's is so far superior to the old headphones and the near field monitors that I use them almost exclusively when performing these tasks now. One of the most pleasant surprises was hearing the left and right pan effect of playing the keys on my Roland Fantom X-8 just as you would on an acoustic piano: I really couldn't tell before until using the headphones. I do plan on purchasing a more expensive pair of Shure headphones in the future only if their sound will surpass the sound quality of the SRH440's with a highly noticeable difference in audio quality.

Anyone considering a headphone purchase should definitely check out the SRH440's for serious consideration!"
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones after looking at headphones for a few months. I bought them for their ability to deafen every sound outside of the cups. They're closed, meaning they don't have as great of a soundstage as open cans, but the soundstage is definitely large.

First of all, I had these cans running at a bit of a higher volume than normal(I didn't have them blasting, but had the volume up maybe 10 percent.) for a full day and a half straight. I listened to them for a few hours of that time, but I had other things to do. Also, I've had them for about a month now.

The sound quality at any frequency of these cans is superb. I haven't been able to distort them with my iPhone or my laptop at any percentage of volume. I've equalized these cans to try it, and I have to say it doesn't work well although I dislike equalizing anything.

My biggest complaint in sound is that the bass feels strange to my ears. I'm used to having bass hit me from woofers from my component system, and from subwoofers. The bass range is good for speakers not based on bass(pun intended) and that's always good. After listening to these phones solely for 5 or so hours, I got accustomed to the bass and found it to be rich.

The reason for the 4 stars in comfort is because of the headband. The bottom isn't cushioned enough, and after extensive use(5 to 6 hours), my head started to become sore. Even if I stopped listening to them for an hour or two, after putting them back on for another hour, I felt the pain again. I've decided to extend the cups more than usual, and fit the cup to my ear while moving the headband further back on my head, and it's been working well."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound great.
Pros. They Sound great, Very Durable, Detachable cable (great for replacing if anything ever happens it the one your using), Removable ear pads (you can upgrade or replace them), Comes with carrying Pouch and 3.5mm to 1/4 in adapter.

Cons Can get a little hot after a while, a Little bulky, you get what you put in; meaning if you play badly recorded music you will hear it and it can hurt your ears.

Overall its a great headphone and brand i would buy again if mine ever broke"
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Typical outstanding Shure quality both in build and sound.

Headphones are large and very solid yet comfortable.

Sound is excellent with wide yet balanced dynamics, good volume, and efficient passive noise insulation.

Very reasonable price. These headphones are way superior to far more expensive headphones from Bose and similar others.

Highly recommended for critical listening to both classical and modern music."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just give this headphones 2 stars because the echo cancel doesn't work at all, I bought this ones because that feature for recording. If you want a regular headphones, this one will do the work, but if you want for recording, you try another brand. The ""superior isolation"" was the main reason, but so disappointing. As a matter of fact when I down the volume of any device i connect to the headphones I always hear a little noise."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think these headphones are very good, the sound is even, rich and deep, yet you can hear what is around you without it disturbing you music. It doesn't have the fake loud bass that ""Beat"" headset have, but they do give the clear detail production of your music and vocal.
The only negative I would say is the plastic hinges to hold the ear piece, seem like they can break if drop or force to hard, but they fold up nicely.
Over all I say for the money spend you can't go wrong, I would recommend it to other, and would buy it again."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish these headphones were more comfortable. The top of my head starts to ache when I wear it for more than half an hour. I like the audio quality though, so it's a shame I can't wear them for very long. It's stored away most of the time, because I just don't like wearing it."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent reproduction and comfort. I have four pair of these phones for musicians to use in my project studio and everyone seems to be impressed with the audio quality and ""fit"" of the Shure SRH440's. They are holding up well to the ""less than gentle"" treatment they are given session after session. Overall, I've never had problems with Shure products, which seem to be well designed and properly manufactured for long and reliable professional use."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"these sound slightly brighter and fuller than my seven-year-old HD-280s, but maybe that's just because they're new. (I like classical and jazz)

I like them enough, but the cups aren't big enough to fit all the way around my ears, and the padding is not thick enough to hold the driver off my ear. They're still better than on-ear phones, but if you have big ears, get the HD-280s. The Shure phones also have the sound wires routed externally around the driver pivot, which exposes it to tugging and wear; I'm worried that will be the first point of failure."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very very sturdy and they had a nice clean sound. Shipment came early. I was comparing them to beats on YouTube and they talked me into these and I can say I'm glad they did. Between these and my neighbors beats I think these are my fav dnt get me wrong I'm not saying beats are bad but if you can get these for the same price or cheaper than beats than u gotta be crazy to not get these but this is just my opinion.
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for recording and quiet practice when I'm at my friend's house. The overall balance is pretty good, but I would say that the treble slightly overpowers the bass and mids. I play bass, so sometimes this is a problem. Then again, my one guitarist has an awful ear and turns his guitar up about 50% too high. Definitely doesn't help. But for casual listening, I think the range on them is quite good, and they are comfortable for long periods of time."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are pretty amazing. I may be a little biased as the headphones I was using prior to these were twenty dollar Sony's, but I know good headphones when I hear them as I am constantly trying new headphones at music conventions and the like. These headphones are particularly perfect for country, folk, acoustic, and classic rock. I can literally hear Eric Clapton's hands sliding up and down his neck as he plays Crossroads. Alison Krauss's voice sounds more buttery than normal and I'm picking up small nuances and breaths in the Civil Wars songs that I never even knew existed. I listened to ""Fool That I Am"" by Etta (RIP) at least five times because it felt like I was REALLY hearing the song for the first time.
These headphones have a very natural sound to them, even, but not boring. If you want something with a lot of bass, then these are not for you. The bass is good, but if you primarily listen to hiphop/dub step/new R&B and want a bass that is going to bounce your brain around, I'd pick up something else. However, if your iPod is filled with various artists and genres and you need a pair of headphones that will suit all your needs for just under a Benjamin, then these are perfect. I'm sure these headphones will only get better as I burn them in and I cannot wait.
My only con with these headphones is that they are a little uncomfortable after about an hour of wear, but as they are literally fresh out of the box I'm sure they just need time to stretch and conform to my head. I have yet to pick up the 840 pads to replace the stock pads, but I am positive that this will only improve the response and isolation (isolation is very good btw. I use them to play drums and I can listen to my track at a normal volume and hear my drums with ease).
Bottom line:
If you want a very even EQ and good isolation then these are perfect.
However, you want a very bass heavy pair of headphones, look elsewhere. I hear the Dr. has a pretty good pair :)

Back to listening..."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to use around the house primarily with my phone. They sound absolutely fantastic as long as you use a good equalizer. If you are using them with a phone I would strongly suggest testing them on an app called Power Amp. With this app you can crank the base up until it turns your brain to mush. If you like classical music you can set it for that and turn the base down and it sounds superb. Best all around headphone I have ever used. (important) I tested these and my other headphones and ear buds with almost every music app available for android and Power Amp is the best. The UI in Power Amp is not my favorite but the sound adjustment more then makes up for that.
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones last year, and they have turned out to be a great purchase.

First off, the sound quality of these headphones is fantastic. I feel immersed in the music when wearing these. Some may find the bass to be a little weak, but I appreciate hearing the music as it was recorded. The bass seems accurate while not being overbearing.

The comfort was something I was initially concerned about. This was actually the greatest negative for the headphones in my opinion. I did not find the 440's too heavy for my neck as some reviewers stated, but I did find the cups to be too stiff. At the recommendation of another reviewer I bought a set of replacement cups for the SRH840's. These cups were fantastic and they fit exactly as the stock pads did. They were superior in comfort and sound isolation. I would highly recommend this upgrade as they made a world of difference.

Another pro in favor of these headphones is the SRH440's durability. When I took them out of the box over a year ago I was immediately impressed by how solid the phones felt. This product has been designed to last for years, and I think that Shure did a good job with these.

Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for accurate and long-lasting headphones."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: This is an extremely fine sounding headphone. The cans fold in for transport with mechanisms that appear sufficiently durable. The detachable, locking single cord is a fantastic design element that others would do well to adopt.
Cons: Coiled cord was a deal killer for me, although one can replace the cord with a straight cord. (It may be available with a straight cord out of the box, what I thought I'd ordered...) Among three competitors tested, however, these phones were the least comfortable to wear.

In both sound and build quality, these Shures came in a very close second place after many hours of side-by-side comparison with Sennheiser's 448s and Audio-Technica's M50. Although the winning AT M50s seem a bit heavier and a bit more unwieldy, they are also more comfortable and secure, in addition to having a more realistic sound stage. But these Shures are a very solid choice. They are also a great value for the money."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, now almost 2 years later still is in perfect condition except for a small piece of plastic which broke when I dropped my headphones on the floor. The only con is that the headphones are not so comfortable after two or more hours of continuous use."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a recording studio. For the musicians I use a cheaper quality that Amazon also carries. But for me to make a good mix these are fantastic. They do not create a false bass which some do. It is all straight and flat in the sense that it does not add to the sound. They give you an exact sound. I also am a huge fan of the screw on adapter. Makes a huge difference. Worth every penny
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for well over a year and the more I use them the better they sound, they do need to be broken in. They come with a flex cord that can be removed. I have had them on for a period of time and the comfort level is ok, they can be a little heavy after a while. I use these to mix and play. Four stars for comfort level."
0,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughters birthday present and they are very good. My daughter is a musician, so she hears music very well and she said these sound very nice. However, I felt that the construction was a little flimsy. They feel very fragile. That said it has been 6 months and my daughter is still using these and they seem to be working very well for here."
1,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"This has already been reviewed to death, and I can only echo what everyone else has said.

These headphones sound great. For $90 it's hard to beat these. They do a fantastic job of isolating noise from your surroundings.

One issue I had with them is that after a few months of ownership the hinges and swivel points began to squeak/creak. They still work great, but if they move at all, there is an audible creak. If you are listening to music quietly, you can hear the creaking over the music.

Otherwise though, fantastic."
2,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure offers incredible sound well balanced between treble and bass: unlike many headphones, the bass is not overextended or blurry. They are not comfortable headphones to wear, but worth the slight discomfort. Also seals out external noise very effectively, without leaking sound to the outside world. Highly recommended."
3,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound with great balance, smooth and detailed response. As with most Shure products, these perform well beyond their modest price and styling would suggest. I use them for recording and casual listening, and have zero complaints. Some have said they lack bass, but I don't hear that. The bass is there, and so is everything else across the entire range. Love 'em."
4,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a good set of headphones to wear 8+ hours a day while working. I needed something that wouldn't put pressure on my glasses, or shift around, or get too hot. I also didn't want to spend a lot of money as they will get stuffed in my bag with my laptop for shuttling between work and home.

These headphones delivered on everything, and the sound is simply awesome. The padding is very comfortable. The adjustments were easy and don't seem prone to slipping. The headphones fold up into a neat package and come with a leather-like drawstring bag.

The coiled cord is a good length for using connected to my laptop or iPhone while still being neat. There's a straight cord available separately. The cord has a screw thread for attaching the included 1/4"" adapter, and a rotating lock on the other to attach the headphones. Both are very nice touches.

The sound is truly remarkable. I've been listening to the built-in laptop speakers and Apple earbuds for so long that I had forgotten what my music sounded like. The mids are clear, the highs aren't shrill, and the bass is definitely present. These are my first closed headphones and the bass is vastly better than any open phones or earbuds that I've ever heard."
5,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Up front: I was using some standard Apple earbuds before I bought these, and a pair of JVC Gumy earbuds before the Apple earbuds.

Overall, I really do like these headphones, and I've been using them for about a week. They provide decent amounts of low [I'd be content with a little more, but I knew that it was going to be a pretty flat EQ on these before I bought them], and very crisp, prevalent highs. Specifically, the highs sound really, really nice when you're listening to the crash on a drum kit, or something of the sort.

Generally in my experience-

--Pros:
-Great highs, pretty good lows
-Clear, crisp quality
-Block outside noise pretty well

--Cons:
-Could be a little more comfortable [specifically on the headband], but it certainly isn't a deal-breaker.

---

For the price tag on these, they're definitely worth the buy, in my opinion. They seem to hover around $85-$90, but if you wait, they'll occasionally drop to about $75, which is when I bought them. I can't really imagine getting anything else quite this good at $75."
6,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these headphones, they are pretty sweet. I love the 10' cord, I feel perfectly safe standing up from my laptop and not worrying about my headphones being tragically ripped out. The headphones are extremely comfortable from the first time I put them on, and the earcups are very big compared with my Philips headphones, which feels great even after a few hours of wearing them.

A few notes about the sound quality:
Audio is very clean and there is great sound definition. The bass is nothing impressive however, I wish there was a bassboost feature/switch. These headphones are excellent, but they seem to be more for studio recording since the vocal quality is quite excellent. So, the bottom line is if you want a great pair of headphones at a good price, pick these - if you want an AMAZING pair (for you audiophiles out there), step up to a more expensive pair from Shure."
7,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these sight unseen. It was a mistake. They have great sound and are highly rated, but they are not comfortable to wear.
I should have tested them in person before I purchased, and so should you."
8,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very affordable and fairly comfortable given the size and weight. Even though they aren't technically noise cancelling, they do a very good job at muffling external sounds."
9,Shure SRH440 Professional Studio Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"So after doing some research on headphone/audiophile forums I came to decide on these. I have to skip over the part about technical aspects of sound. However I can say (with the SRH840 pads) these are very comfortable. They stay on my head when I am moving around and close out the outside noise well. Even when off they cancel out a good deal of outside noise. They grip my head but not too tight, just right. For the $80 I paid I think these are great, certainly in a league with my friends' Beats by Dre and I paid way less. Some people say you would want to pick up an amp with these because of higher impedance but they are plenty loud for me even at lower volumes they do okay. If you are a nitpick about sound I would get an amp but if not they do great all alone.

Summary: I'm not an expert, they are comfortable with the better pads from the SRH840 (Average without), sound fine without an amp, and are a great bang for your buck at $80.

If you get these, MAKE SURE YOU A SET OF PADS THAT FOR THE SRH840, they literally take 30 seconds to change out and totally make these headphones fantastic, they are about an extra 15$, absolutely hands down worth it and I was on the fence about it when I ordered them.

Let me be crystal clear here. If you buy these headphones, buy a set of replacement pads that are for the SRH840 to change out the stock pads, its worth it, trust me, I'm a guy on the internet."
