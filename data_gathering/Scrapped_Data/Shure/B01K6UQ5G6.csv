0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried for years to find earphones I could use for listening to podcasts, but until now they've all had too much wind noise, from $30 in-ear Bluetooth models to the Bose 20i. These Shures have enough passive noise isolation that I can comfortably hear podcasts at a moderate volume, even when doing 40 mph downhill. I don't know how sweat-proof they'll be, but a 3 hour ride in hot weather that included pouring water on my head wasn't a problem for the earphones.

Edit: took off a star because the mic's sensitivity to wind noise makes it useless on a moving bicycle for voice commands. I tried putting tape over the remote, but that didn't solve the problem. Other than that, my ears ache slightly when wearing them for 4-5 hour straight, but that's more than acceptable for the noise isolation."
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my 1st set of Shure's 12 years ago and they still sound great and are in excellent shape to this day - just change the foam tips regularly, plug and hit play. But with this set, I get the convenience of the mic to make and take calls on my iPhone also. I was pleased from the very first note of music I listened to immediately upon receiving them for my birthday. They sound great and will only get better the more I use them. They look nice also - the white and black contrast is very tasteful. I'm a business traveler and have had 2 sets of Bose QC's (wired & wireless) and the noise blocking on these is so much more effective than the noise cancellation in the Bose (not to mention I won't get the 'headset dent' look in my hair after a 2-3 hr. flight). The only knock I can think of is that the case they came with is a rather flimsy zippered pouch, unlike the original hard round clamshell case of my original set. Otherwise, an excellent product. Highly recommended."
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say, Shure SE215 has been one of the best audio quality and fit earbuds I have ever used. I've only had one BIG issue, and that is they break somewhat often. After 6 months of use, the right earbud started cutting off. I sent it back and the 2-year warranty covered the repair at no cost. The problem was the wire. Before this pair, I owned the original SE215's and those had the same issue. About 1 year in, the issue happened and I sent them for repair. About 3-years in, the issue happened again and I bought these. This cable feels more ""cheap"" than the original black SE215's (no mic). I think this Mic only works with IOS so keep that in mind. The fit is amazing, and the sponge-like earbuds make sound isolation possible at a mid-high volume. Shure needs to invest in R&D for new generation better durability earbuds."
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones to replace a 10+ year pair of Shure SE in-ear phones. While the older earphones sounded great, the wires had started to crack and cut my ears while I used them. I purposely purchased this model because of the additional microphone the unit to be used for phone conversations with my iPhone. Here's the comparison to an older version: a) The cord is shorter and the gauge wire is smaller than the older model. B) The phones sound more bassy than the older pair...this means that at lower volumes, they sound muddy. C). The inclusion of the microphone limits how close you can move the plastic slider to secure the ear buds. This, along with the shorter cord leads to a sloppier fit if you try to run the cord behind your head. Pluses would include: 1) the ""hinged"" style ear bud is easier to insert and find a comfortable listening position, 2) The cable is replaceable so if ""wire rot"" occurs with this pair, I can replace it rather than throwing the pair away. I have a pair of Bose earbuds that I use for business calls all week. I think I prefer the more ""open"" design of these phones because the tighter/closed nature of these phones is hot to use over extended periods of time. Overall - it's a solid purchase from Shure without having to spend big bucks for the more advanced models."
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE SHURE HEADPHONES, AND THESE DIDN'T LET ME DOWN!

I splurged on these after owning a pair of SE110s for 10 years. I used those things every day, on my way to work on the subway. Fantastic headphones with good sound. Most importantly, they lasted forever. Finally, one of the earbuds was shorting out because of a bad connecting.

These are built just as well, and they have much richer sound. Bass is readily available, and the mids are starting to warm up well as the headphones break in. They also feature similar build quality to my se110s, with a replaceable cord. The remote works well with IOS, but I haven't used an android phone. I look forward to putting these on, but I just need to make sure the music quality is good enough for the headphones to match!"
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On my long search for earbuds that can suit me for good quality music and mobile use, these are my final answer. I've read all the reviews and so I had to give them a try. I've went through many other brands at lower price points and wasted a lot of money but this makes up for it all.

These are totally worth the money. I'm not gonna go in depth with how they sound but SERIOUSLY these blew me away. They fit so well, they're lightweight and feel like they're not even there. And the sound quality is the best at its price range, allowing me to hear the drums, guitars, and vocals in my favorite rock tracks and all the ranges of sound in any electronic song.

The cable is also a big improvement upon the stock model, being thinner overall but keeping the durability all the same. The aux does not fit inside a lifeproof case unfortunately.

Overrall I couldn't take these out of my ears when they arrived so if that's something to go off of, 9/10 earbuds. Wish they came in solid blue though."
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these Shure SE215 special edition earbuds on March 30 and they are a huge upgrade from what I usually use. The only complaint I have is the cable, like any other cable they get damaged and stop working (I'm glad I can replace the detachable cable, which is a third of the price of the actual earbuds) but this particular cable seem to break prematurely because within the 6 months of having them the right earbud with the mic went out without any visible breakage. I take very well care of my earbuds and managed to make the brand 'Skullcandy' earbuds to last more than a year without breaking. As for the sound quality, they are the best sound I've ever owned in an earbud. I'd suggest buying the Shure earbuds without the mic because it's too bulky and from my experience makes the earbud go out prematurely."
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed at the quality of these earphones. I upgraded to the model that has a microphone and buttons on the cable for an extra 20 bucks. I had just purchased cheapo headphones my entire life and figured that I'd upgrade and get some nicer ones as a treat so I bit the bullet and spent over 100 bucks on these. At first, they sounded great. The noise-cancelling is fantastic and the sound is actually noticeably better. However, last night, I plugged them into my phone and only one side was working. After about a month, they had already broken. How is this possible? I am not rough with these: I don't run with them, I've never stepped on them or sat on them, I don't travel with them. I really only used them for music in bed at night and when cleaning the house. I was willing to live with the fact that the actual product page doesn't clearly have any notes about the cable not working completely for Android (wtf?) and I didn't realize it until after the fact. What's the point of having a cable that only works for iOS? Now I have to go through the entire mess of using the warranty."
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only earbuds that don't hurt my ear canals with fit. The rest of them fall out, hurt or otherwise just don't work. The sound is crystal and the noise reduction is a life saver on those ""family friendly"" trips."
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, excellent bass (heavy but not grossly so), love the inline controls. Little zipper case is decent.

None of the default ear buds that it comes with are comfortable IMO. Even the small foam ones seem to hurt the inside of my ears after an hour or two. Might look into getting a custom fit set. Not going to ding a star for it, i'm really paying for the drivers and the buds have almost always been a disposable item."
0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I consider myself fairly experienced with a wide range of headphones and I try to kee expectations reasonable for a given price point. I don't find these to be a value at all.

On the upside, they are very comfortable and Shure provides a wide range of inserts so you can swap as needed. I can wear for long periods of time with no discomfort. Cable attachment allowing swivel as a great idea.

External noise isolation is more than adequate with being eerily quiet. I do like to have some awareness of my surrounding when music is low or off. I use a set of JH Audio JH-16 IEMs and they really cut out almost all external noise. Maybe too much for some situations.

Now I understand that there are many very positive reviews based upon sound quality. That's one of the reasons I bought them. I don't get it at all. To me, they sounded overly warm to the point of somewhat muddy. Frequency definition was loose and bled together. Boring sound. Flat highs, forward miss and muddy bass. I've had lowest end Polk and midrange Senns that beat the heck out these in terms of clarity and accuracy, two or the areas most important to me.

I will compliment the soundstage. It sounded very accurate to me. Live and studio music both have a realistic sense of scale and space. That part was nice.

In short, there are so many other earbuds that really outshine these. I think the sound/comfort/cost ratio simply made these a poor value. I can get way better sounding buds for close to the same money or less.

These really sounded to me like $16 Skull Candy buds. In contrast, I bought some Denon AH-C820s for $199 and they sound like $500+ competitors. They exceeded expectations while these really fell short.

In fairness, I will say that I listened to these on both an iPhone 7 as well as an Onkyo DP-X1. These buds did sound moderately better on the Onkyo and likely would have gone from mediocre to pretty good if I swapped the cable for a balanced cable.

Only problem is that I don't always carry the Onkyo and I would think it's not too much to get decent sound with an iPhone. I would think that the number of people using these buds with some kind of high-end player vs those with a traditional cell phone has got to be small. Way more people listening on a cell phone. That's why I am being so rough on these buds.

I'm going to give them to my son and he will like them. He's a big bass fan when he listens to music and I think they do a respectable job there.

I recommend you look elsewhere if you are committed to this price range. The Shures I would recommend are way out of this price range. If you were will to spend a little more for earbuds that far outperform way more expensive models, I highly recommend the afore-mentioned Denons.

Purely my opinion... happy listening!"
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear concise sound with just enough bass make these my favorite headphones I have ever purchased. An added benefit is the incredible design of the ear pieces. The quality sound is due in part by how solid the ear piece fits in your ear. I like the fact that when I turn my head the ear piece stays tightly fit in my ear it works great during my workouts
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price! These have the lower frequencies enhanced more than the original SE215. The bass enhancement does not muddy up the midrange much compared to the originals. Treble and midrange are still slightly recessed, but nothing that you can complain about for $120 in ear monitors.

The iOS cable is great, it's very light. Supposedly it is Kevlar reinforced as well, but it certainly isn't as bulky as other Shure Kevlar cables.

All accessories are nice, including the carrying pouch. I actually use Westone Black Star tips for all of my headphones, they are much more comfortable for my ears than all others, including annoying hot foam tips.

The cable was my primary reason for purchase of the SE215m+, as I've already owned the SE215. Great headphones for everyday use!"
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually had to read the manual to figure out how to get these in my ear correctly. I tried them for a few subway rides and found them to be too fussy to get in, too clumsy to get out. Part of it goes into your ear, outside the ear canal, so it has a big presence on your head - almost looks like a hearing aid. The sound is amazing though. I wanted to make them work but just sent them back. I know I'll get too annoyed fumbling with them on my commute."
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my first review in amazon, i thought it would be rude not to give 5 stars for a great product, this is in a different league from any other earpud, specially if you are used to the crappud from apple, reasons to consider this product are
1- great sound quality
2- great noise isolation, it doesn't cancel noise by emitting voices to count them but actually isolate you from outside noise and it works GREAT.
3- it takes some time to get used to wearing it but once you get the hang of it, it will fit Perfectly in your ear
4- the build quality is superb and i expect it to out last apple ear pud which i replace them ever 2 months due to them losing sound on one side.
5- optional ear fittings with different sizes come with the product and a nice small case"
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very nice; a few things - the bass seems to be weak at first listen.
Also, if you're an iphone 7 user...the controls for the music will not work :/.

I had the clear version before and one of the sets died so I got this as a replacement. Overall, very nice and compares pretty well to the clear version without the music controls."
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great but are very impractical for removing and putting back in your ears. Takes a lot of maneuvering to get them to fit properly.
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked brilliantly for about a week, then the left ear began to cut in and out. Now I have to figure out the return. ANNOYING!"
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wire short in less than 3 months. Bought a replacement cable, babied it, and it also shorted out. It seems as if this is a common problem. Other than the cable the sound is great. Sent them back and hopefully they can upgrade the cable and honor the warranty."
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW. Bought them in May. A bud broke in September. Thought it might be the cord. Bought a new cord. But no, definitely broke. That's a lot of money to spend on a set of headphones that can't last a summer. After 5- years only buying from Shure, this is the end. Time to find a new company. It was nice while it lasted."
0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Preface: I have owned the Bose QC15, and the jaybird bluebuds. These trump them.

I am not a true audiophile - only indulging as my budget allows - but I enjoy playing piano, and have been formally developing an ear for music since age 6. The sound isolation and quality put out by the SE215m+ are truly astounding. The foam ear(plugs)pieces isolate effectively, and allow the purity of sound to shine. I have never encountered a set of headphones that allows me to spatially relate with music the way these do. I feel as if I am in a world of my own, insulated in a private music studio when I wear these. 1st test was Bruno Mars's 24k Magic (not a conventional test, I know), but then! The bass rips and drops, the high twinkles ring off towards the ceiling, the lyrics clear and vibrant... suddenly to my right I notice my wife, beautiful as always... but what's this? She's hollering at me... a word... my name?? Alas, I decide to leave this sanctuary... and as pinky rings were to the moon, so must her blood pressure be, my man Bruno laying down a righteously starry soundtrack to that pulsing vein on my wife's temple there. Alrightg2gbblguys"
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the earbuds, great sound and comfort. But just like the last model 215s, a few months of regular use and my left channel started dropping out. I know the wire is replaceable but I would have expected a longer life for these after they updated the design. I guess they are happy with customers having to essentially subscribe to their product rather than have it built well enough to last years."
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great, but *all four pairs* I have owned have stopped working after a few months. For all 4, the audio started cutting out in one ear (apparently this is a well-known issue, see other reviews). For 2/4, the over-ear ""grip"" broke, becoming completely flimsy,

It's a shame because these headphones sound great and isolate well. Fortunately, they come with a 2 year warranty, but I'm tired of replacing headphones every few months."
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy. Slightly bass biased as advertised but good definition in mids and highs. This is my first pair of earphones and fit is hypercritical it took a couple attempts to get it right. Only thing I miss from over-ear headphones is there is slightly less sound stage, which I happily traded for compactness and portability."
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have bought these headphones twice now, because they're incredible at blocking out noise. And they're comfortable. But both pairs stopped working after a year, despite my having taken good care of them."
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding sound quality, very transparent, and the controls work with my Nexus 5x"
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work so well I love them!
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these with the Avioms at my church. The sound of the other band people in my mix is near perfect. The only thing I don't like is putting them in. It's awkward, and sometimes I have to move quickly to my keyboard, and don't have time it takes to put them in my ear. I like the earlier design, however the sound is beautiful."
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound but poor quality cable. The cable of my headphones stop working before 5 months, now only I can hear the music from the left side of the headphones. I prefer buy a new cable from another company because I read that people who buy the cable from sure have to replace in less time than 5 months"
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had these for a few years gone through 6 cables but the iems themself still work and sound great very nice for the price as long as you get a good deal in the ear canal they are some of the best for the money.
0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,A step up from the rest. Excellent everything.
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not excited about the fit for these earphones. I tried several of the optional ear bud covers and they still fall out of my ears and are uncomfortable. I owned an earlier model of these ear phones and they were of much better quality.
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds amazing.
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A little bass-heavy at times, but otherwise very comfy and clear-sounding."
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,fabulous
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound and noise reduction. I use them when I fly for work and they really reduce the noise.
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best headphones I've ever used. They fit comfortably and snuggly in the ear, and I can't even turn them up as high as my old headphones. Definitely worth the money. The bass isn't crazy or over emphasized, but quality nonetheless."
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked them but the cord is too short vs the SE315. I was always catching it on things given the length and the rubbery texture. I lost this pair (I think) and am trying to figure out if I buy the same one.
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones for the gym.
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice. They do what you expect
0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"On my third occasion using these, after I had owned them for not yet two weeks, I found that if I turned my head to the right, the sound would cut out of the left earphone. This began spontaneously and I don't believe I did anything that triggered it."
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice color and sound. If you happen to decide between white se or blue se, take into account that they sound almost the same. Imho white have even better sound. No surprise, blue are older models."
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t say enough good things about these headphones... work great with my iPhone as well. Extremely comfortable for long periods of time.
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound really great. I had an issue as they wouldn't work on iPhone 7 (popping sound and vol controls didn't work). I contacted Shure and they recommended I exchange them. The new ones arrived 2 days later and no issues, just a bad set."
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality was great. I had these for 4-5 months and they already broke and stopped working. I bought a new wire to see if it was just a chord issue but it's still not working. I expect a lot more based on reviews and the price.
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really awesome sound. No complaints.
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, but they're somewhat cumbersome to get inserted and in good position in your ear. Noise cancelling properties quite good."
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great looking. Great sound. Amazing sound isolating like seriously you cant hear anything with them on. but slightly uncompfortable for people with small ears, other than that defiantly recommend."
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The foam tips that came with the iems weren't that great and mine didn't come with the tri cone tips but they still sound great .

2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great earphones but the part of the cable which plugs into a device snapped off... quality of sound is great though and the isolation is also great.

4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great noise isolation.
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,1st set the mic was defective. Mic is pretty clunky. Sound quality is pretty good.
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent build and sound quality only issue for me was the jack had a very sensitive wire and l shaped plug might help otherwise amazing product
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Received these beauties a few days ago and absolutely blown away at the quality at this price point. Absolutely no regrets.
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t even last 7 months, too expensive not to even last a year. I’m not a kid and take good care of these."

0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a set of clear Shure SE215 and they are bombproof and awesome. These are not. The cable is cheap and tangles easily. After 1 week of use, the 3.5mm plug broke in my phone and they stopped working altogether. See photo comparison. Return is pending. If you want good earphones, get the original clear SE215. Don't bother with these."

2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels good to be home again. As an early adopter of E2Cs they died after years of daily use. I wandered trying a bunch of other buds, even Etymotics but nothing seals and isolates as well as Shure do and nothing blocks microphonics as well either.

These are still built very heavy duty like the E2Cs were too.

I think I'm going to finally get some ear molds done."
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on sound quality and noise reduction these get a 4 Stars, but this one is a bit on the pricey side but they work great at isolating noise this will save my ears working in a shop.
ot happy with this purchase!
I would hesitate to recommend to a friend!"
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I first ordered a pair of the Shure ear buds without the mic and they seemed to have a much thicker wire. I just opened the package today June 11th and noticed that the wire on this model is thinner. Not sure if i am going to like these but i will try them the next couple of days to see if the wire tangles up or not. I'm not impressed so far...
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is very good but disappointed that we can't remove the sleeve that fits over the ear buds to find a good fit. They seem to be glued on so can't remove them to find a better fit for my ears.
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was going to send them back because I can't really afford them right now but I tried them out first. Wound up with them in my ears for almost 8 solid hours.
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice earbuds. I only have two problems with them.
1. The cord is a bit too short.
- I find myself wishing the chord was a bit longer, maybe just 3 or 4 inches longer.
2. The bass isnt the best. It's there but if you're getting these expecting great bass sound maybe you should look for a different pair."
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these earbuds a few days ago and already sending back for a replacement. Was having intermittent cutout on the left earbud. As well the center button was not functioning as expected. You would click and hear the click but it would not pause the music. You had to press till you heard and felt the click and then a little more firm to get the desired functionality.

However, among these cons the sound and comfort are unmatched by anything I've ever owned or listened to. From Metal, to EDM (DnB, Trance, etc) these things sound great. Vocals are clear, instrumentation is articulated well, and has a very solid bass. These stay solid in the ear and the comfort is absolutely incredible to the point I don't want to take them out they feel that natural. Sound isolation is very good and the memory like foam creates a great seal.

I can only give these 3 stars at this point because of the hardware issues. I'm sending them back for a replacement. I've purchased and punished some Shure SE112-GR at $50 and they are still going strong even with all the rubber giving way and cracking and being used heavily all day for well over 18 months. To me $100+ earbuds should be able to hold up just as well. Will see how the replacement buds fare."

0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product. Good choice for quality/price search. I bought this for my Moto G4 Plus but it doesn't works like I expected. Anyways, it a good option to listen music with good quality."
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,All fine but you need to press the play-pause/answer call button to make it actually work
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is superb. One of the better earphones I've listened to. The over the ear implementation is a bit difficult but after a few tries I got the on/off process down. The deal killer is the remote volume/rocker switch implementation. It's one piece with a very very small button in the center to hang up/skip songs. The one piece rocker makes it difficult to feel if your increasing/decreasing volume or skipping songs. Plus the small button isn't very tactile in sensing if you clicked it right or not. Half the time I pause the music instead of skipping a song. I have to take out my phone to change songs, etc. Thats just not how I use my earphones. I like to leave my phone in my pocket. It's too bad because they do sound great."
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,so good
4,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is inexistent in tis product. For a lower or similar price range (1More or Bose), there are other double and triple dynamic high definition drivers that can deliver quality balanced sound. Without a decent DAC amplifier, there is only a noisy bass sound that lacks high definition sound, thus making these ear headphones not worth it for the price. Good warranty (2 years) and confortable design are a plus though."
5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I've only been using these headphones for 4 months and they're already broken. They've only seen light use in dry conditions, but the left earpiece is unreliable and only works if the cord is positioned a certain way in the jack. I cannot recommend these headphones."
6,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these headphones. And, for about one week, I did. Excellent sound quality throughout the entire range, capable of handling just about any genre of music I could throw at it. Once I got used to fitting them (which, honestly, didn't take long), I could easily put them on with one hand. And, because of the care given to the fit of these headphones, sound isolation was fantastic. Finally, a pair of headphones that I could immerse myself in for the 2 hours a day I spend on the train...

And then, catastrophe. I had the headphones plugged in to my iPhone 6s and had my phone in my pocket. I leaned forward to reach for something, and I felt something give on the headphone connector. Oh no. Next thing I know, I could only get audio over one channel. I took out the headphones to find the 1/8"" jack was broken. Still attached to the cord, but it was able to move in ways it couldn't before. I didn't put much stress on the jack for it to break like that, but break it did. I was heartbroken.

This appears this is a critical design flaw by Shure. If you compare the jack on a stock pair of iPhone headphones, you'll see a hard plastic casing around where the jack and the cord meet. Clearly, this additional casing is designed to take the stress of mobile use. On the Shure, nothing. Just soft rubber. The difference is clear: one headphone is up to the rigors of being used on a phone and one is not. For Shure, who market this m+ edition with the controls and mic as a mobile phone headset replacement, this is simply unacceptable. For that reason, I'm giving these headphones a 1-star rating.

No matter how good the sound quality, how comfortable the headset, or how well it isolates sound, if you can't use it on the go with any confidence, it's of no use."
7,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The audio jack comes out easily, it occasionally crackled, and the buttons on the wire went out. The sound was not anything special. (I got the white ones with the button thing on the wire)"
8,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Stay away if you don't like an unreliable earphone. Great sound, horrible reliablity! Going back to Bose."
9,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my first pairs of ""higher quality"" earbuds were the Shure 215K Black. I thought they sounded terrific-a ""fun"" sound was the word several reviewers used to describe them. I am writing this specifically to those people who bought the Shure and the additional kit for $50 that gave you a long cable with no ""ear contours"" that kind of flipped and flopped all over the place and really made the setup a bit unmanageable if you wanted to use a mic and iPhone controls.

Well Shure listened to their customers complaints and put together this new kit which comes with the white plastic shells and a black form fitting cable with mic and controls that works very well with iPhone and Apple devices. The controls do not work on Android devices. As far as the volume and mic, they are standard fare for an IEM in this price range, plastic but sturdy. The cable has no microphonics and is made of a relatively thick rubbery type substance similar to an RHA cable for those familiar with that brand. They are a bit bulky but work perfectly and only time will tell how they wear.

As far as comfort, Shure got it right with a very comfortable wrap around your ears and that great Shure fit. If you want a $100 pair of IEM's that sound far better than the cost would allow, spend the extra $20 and get these Shures and you will have a great pair of IEMS.

They say the bass is enhanced from the regular SE215 but it's not booming by any means. It is not a neutral ""audiofile"" sound. It is clearly a V shaped sound with slight emphasis on bass. Bass heads will love. Other will too.

They have something for everyone. Sound is subjective but you can pump up the volume of your iPhone to max, and the sound will still be relatively clear but loud. It doesn't take much to drive these.

Other reviews go into sound characteristics in detail but I am weighing in on the white M+. Give them a try, You'll probably be glad you did."
0,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Base is awesome, sound is fantastic! Remote works great! One thing is the cord is less durable than the one that comes with the standard SE215's. The standard cord does not have a remote however, so you have to pick what you care about more. I absolutely love these ear buds, they are super comfortable and sound great!"
1,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Looks like the special editions are half as powerful as the clear I've used for 5 years as my im war monitors. I need to give it double to power from the mixer and then it gets distorted.
2,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a lot of research, my fiance had put these on his wishlist. I purchased them for him for his birthday and within 2 weeks, they were having problems. One side has been having issues with sound. I will be returning them. Very unhappy, especially for the price!"
3,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"perhaps the sound is fine these earphone has two main problems: 1). the ear cables are plug connected, these connections are destroyed constantly and replacement cost tens of dollars, 2). each earbud has inside small metal mesh which filter the ear debris. after short use, this mesh drop and fall and gone forever and the warranty become invalid. since mesh falls and gone the earphone destroyed because of the ear debris. very poor device!"

5,Shure SE215m+ Special Edition Sound Isolating Earphones with Remote...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shure sure it sounds great.
