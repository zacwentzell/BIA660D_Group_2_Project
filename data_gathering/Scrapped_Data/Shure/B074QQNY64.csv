1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because i kept a pair of E2's for 5 years and loved them, so much so that when the shielding wore off of the wire i re-shielded them until the drivers died. Thus when i saw these i just new my problems were solved, so i bought them. They sounded great, not as clean as my E2's but as good as it gets for &100. But only for about 24 hours, then i started getting a bad connection in my 3.5 jack. First i assumed it was probably my 4yr old iPod on its last legs, so i tried them on my newer iPod, my Galaxy S3, and my pc. I noticed that when i shook the 3.5 jack the connection would come and go.

I am debating whether to return these to amazon and buy a different brand like Etymotic, or just have shure replace the cable. But after all the problems i have read about with the earbud ends of the cable i am a little reticent. But i am confused since this is the same cable that they use on their higher priced models, and surely they couldn't be shipping $500 earbuds with substandard cables.

Now i know owning 2 models doesn't make me an expert on Shure brand, but now i am in a relationship and i no longer have the disposable funds of a bachelor, so when i can splurge on something i really want, it is a little more disappointing when i receive DOA merchandise that i was truly looking forward to. I am just happy my girlfriend didn't get them for me for christmas, she would have been even more disappointed than I.

Pros.....Sound great, more bass heavy than a ""monitor"" headphone, but great for everyday use. Replaceable cable could mean years of life for something prone to excessive wear.
Flush fitting which is good for use on a pillow in bed. Sound isolation is superb.

Cons.....Replaceable cable in my case realistically meant 24 hrs of use. Sound isolation, can be a bit overkill, in that my girlfriend couldn't get my attention by yelling
at me from 4 feet. Not to be worn when you need to be aware of your surroundings."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality is great and the fit and the form is very good, i like these audios because the sounds is really good."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best in ears for $100!
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the sound quality of these earphones but they take a while to mould around your ear for the perfect fit.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im a vocalist , These had a wonderful sound !"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I found them uncomfortable, the foam tips to be a burden, and the sound to be too muddy and muffled."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound amazing and fit great. looking forward to buying more pairs of them for the rest of the crew.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amassing sound, crystal clear with excellent base. Sound insulating is marginal. I am a runner and they stay in your ears no matter what."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these headphones after learning that riding on BART in certain parts of the tunnels, the screech/howl can get up to 90 decibels. So instead of turning my iPhone headphones up to ridiculous volume levels in order to drown out the howl (and make me go deaf).... I got these! They are amazing for keeping out the howl, and have great sound quality. My music and podcasts have never sounded so good! The loop over the ear is interesting, though it's a bit of a learning curve to put them on smoothly.
- Variety of ear inserts so you can choose most comfortable (size and texture wise - offer both foam and rubber)
- Cord is detachable from the IEMs so you can replace the cord when it goes out
- Super long cord (can be nice, but can also cause you to get snagged a little more often)
- Bass sounds great, overall sound is great (way better than iPhone headphones)
- Comes with a handy little pouch to store

Love em!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the product from Shure I’ve been waiting for... They are way late to the BT/wireless game but I never really felt left out until recently. I wear a pair of SE535’s that have been around the globe and back and I’ve only gone through two sets of cables in the last 7 years. I’m very pleased with the easy of use of the BT functionality and pairing with my iPhone. I really wish they were up to par with the latest BT 5 classification, but no big deal. I use my headphone daily on my motorcycle and this the BT functionally is a huge upgrade for me. Thumbs up!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are a major step above any other earbuds I've purchased, in terms of sound quality, level of protection to the inner ear that they provide, and their physical resiliency. These are more expensive than most on the market, but you end up saving money because they are nowhere near as fragile as the other kinds, and the detachable cord means that you don't have to replace the earbuds every time the cord is damaged; you simply detach the cord and send it in for replacement. It's also a lot harder to damage the cord because it's thicker and kind of insulated.

I purchased this because I have listened to music, all day at work, for years, wearing earbuds that range in price from $50-$75, and I had begun developing tinnitus as a result. Not wanting to further damage my ears, I switched to,over the ear headphones. These worked really well, but were too unprofessional for work (I looked like an air traffic controller) and didn't work well a at the gym. When I switched back to in-ear earbuds I could really tell how damaging they were; the tinnitus resumed and I began to find it unbearable to listen.

I bought these in the hopes that I could find something discreet enough for work, that produced great sound, and didn't damage my ears. Fortunately, these fit the bill. The sound-cancelling element is surprisingly powerful, which helps protect the ears, is great for the gym, and blocks out annoying co-worker chatter. The sound quality is great; not as good as my high-end over the ear headphones, but definitely better than any earbuds I've used before. The sound is buffered to a certain extent which means that it doesn't trigger my tinnitus and, hopefully will help prevent further damage. I have been using these for close to a year now, so this seems to be the case.

The only thing I don't like about these earbuds is that they're tricky to remove. This is a great feature for the gym because they do not move, much less,pop out, no matter what I do. This is less advantageous at work, when people come up to my desk and I am unable to quickly slip them out of my ears to answer a question, I kind of have to pause and unwind them and then fiddle with them to get them back on the right way. This is somewhat annoying if I am frequently interrupted, but that's nowhere near as annoying as listening to earbuds with poor sound quality that steadily damage my hearing.

The other feature I really, really like about these is that the cord is detachable. With all,of the other earbuds I've used, I found it really frustrating that, as soon as the cord was damaged, the sound would cut out and that was that. No matter how careful I was, this happened a lot, so constantly replacing $50-75 earbuds was really frustrating. With these, the cord detaches from the earbuds; if you damage the cord, you simply send it in for a replacement. Even though these cost more initially than other ones on the market, you definitely save money in the long run.

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About me: I'm a low-end audiophile. I'd buy the expensive stuff, but I simply can't afford it.

About the Shure SE215s: I'm on my second pair of Shure SE215s. The first pair got worn over time, then I let someone borrow them. Suffice it to say they aren't borrowing my stuff anymore.

The SE215s have fantastic sound quality. The bass, lower-, mid-, and upper-range are all crisp and clear. The bass is not boosted, but nice and even with the rest of the frequency range. I've listened to classical, dubstep, jazz, hip-hop, reggae, metal, folk, and soft rock. I've even listened to a pop song or two. Every song I try they outperform any of my other earbuds. The SE215s also block out background noise remarkably well, so there are few distractions from your audio experience. These buds also contain the sound they produce to your ears. You have to nearly damage your hearing for someone sitting next to you to hear a whisper.

One note: these buds are not meant to be worn out and about. You absolutely can, especially if you want to block out the sounds on the bus or subway, but they are not made for it. The cord is longer than normal buds for extra reach. The cord is also thicker than normal for extra durability and quality. As mentioned above, the SE215s block the majority of the background noise, so anywhere where sound is important (such as walking around in a city), they can be dangerous.

As long as you are looking for quality earbuds for focused listening, you can't go wrong with the Shure SE215."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't recommend buying these earphones. They sound great, but shortly after I purchased them, the left earbud kept fading in and out. I constantly have to pull on the cord, pull it out of my ear, push the plug in and basically fiddle around with it every couple of minutes to get the sound to come back. I think the problem is due to a poor design. The cord plugs into the ear buds making it very easy for the connection to short out. At any rate, don't waste your money. I wouldn't buy these again.

UPDATED 1/11/18. I sent these in to Shure as a warranty claim, and they sent them back to me and said they are COUNTERFEIT product. DO NOT buy these from DailyDealzLA, as it's a scam. They'll break and you'll be out the $100 you paid for them. I brought this to the attention of Amazon customer service, and they did issue me a refund. Don't take the risk buying anything from these scam artists though. Amazon should remove them as vendors!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man where do I start on these. These are some quality IEM's. For me, isolation is important because that's part of the whole point of IEM's. If I just wanted quality, I could use my headphones or studio monitors. IEM's are designed to be small and lightweight. Read: portable. If I could sit in one place I'd use my studio monitors. Anyway! On we go:

I first got into the IEM scene with some VSD1S's which were highly recommended by several websites and many reviews, saying they were worth way more than the asking price. I bought them, instantly didn't like them -- they seemed fatiguing to listen to, weren't very comfortable, and transmitted a lot of sound. Sitting in a library, I could still hear everything, even people whispering. Tried burning them in for 100 hours, still no better.

I bought some more ""isolating"" IEM's -- the Meelectronics M6 Pro's, attracted by the price. I couldn't get those to seal in my ear canals very well and they were not comfortable at all. They sounded decent. But then again, what good are they if they don't isolate and aren't comfy?

Enter these SE215's. First time I tried them on, they were noticeably way more comfortable than both other IEM's I'd had. Also, instantly (no burn in) they sounded way better. Other reviewers have said that the bass is ""heard, not felt"" -- which is true. The bass is there but not ""forward"" or muddy by any means. Very balanced. Highs are detailed and the imaging is fantastic. Vocals and mids are there but not prominent in any way. I like my music 'flat' and these do that wonderfully. They aren't fatiguing to listen to, and oh BOY do they isolate! In fact, that deserves a whole new paragraph.

The isolation is unreal. It's like wearing earplugs, that play music. It's great. I have a video of my cousin trying out these earbuds, and I ask him, ""Hey, how's the isolation? Hello? Must be good"" and his face the whole time screams 'bliss' with no care in the world. He definitely did not hear me. I was on the plane, and even with the music paused, I still couldn't hear the flight attendant ask, ""Chicken or beef?"" These definitely are the most isolating earbuds I have ever used. The only place these MIGHT be beat is with droning noises like the jet engine on a plane, where active noise cancelling headphones might beat them. But that's because of how ANC isolates versus how these isolate. (ANC is better with constant noises like droning engine sounds, and these are better where sounds are more 'random'.) In a busy city center, or a subway, or in a loud area, for example, these are hands down superior.

tl;dr: These IEM's are wonderfully comfortable (wore them on a 12 hour flight with no issue), have great sound, and isolate better than anything I've ever tried. Definitely worth the money."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Shure SE215SPE-B-BT1 (special edition, bluetooth) in anticipation of getting a phone with no headphone jack. I also wanted an upgrade from my Klipsch S4i's without breaking the bank. These headphones have delivered on nearly fronts! Sound quality is more than adequate. Compared to the Klipsch S4i's, the Shure's have much greater clarity in the mids and highs. Lows are more substantial on the Klipsch, but definitely not as well controlled. I've always found the bass on the Klipsch to be a little overwhelming. These headphones are not for bassheads, but they are not lacking in bass either. Battery life is fantastic, and the connection is strong even from across the room.

SOUND QUALITY:
Lows (4/5): The special edition headphones supposedly have extended bass compared to the regular model. I do not have the regular model, but the bass does seem well-extended. Bass is slightly emphasized, but it is still very well controlled (at this price point). There is definitely enough ""thump"" to satisfy most people (make sure you get a good seal). That being said, they are a tad more muddy than my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. The detail is much better than the Klipsch's, which seem to emphasize quantity over quality.

Mids (5/5): This is apparently Shure's ""bread and butter"", and I have to agree. The mids are super smooth and forward, reminiscent of my Sennheiser HD598. The detail and clarity is excellent, and I even heard some details I had missed on the Sennheiser's. Vocals sound very intimate. Overall, the mids make these IEMs shine.

Highs (3/5): The highs are definitely where the Shure's falter a little. There is a fairly noticeable treble roll-off (at around 16-17 kHz), which leads to a perceived lack of clarity and detail. All my other headphones have more detail in the highs (but the Klipsch definitely has sibilance issues). The headphones respond decently to EQ, but I found that a lot of my music still lacks the ""sparkle"" compared to my other headphones. However, this does have the benefit of making the headphones very easy to listen to for long hours (I've listened for 6 hours). It also makes it really easy to perceive that the volume is lower than it actually is.

Soundstage/Imaging (3/5): Pretty much what I expected for an IEM. They were better than my Klipsch S4i's. Soundstage was quite a bit smaller than the ATH-M50x and miniscule compared to Sennheiser HD598's. Good separation of instruments.

Comfort (4/5): This is probably going to hit or miss for people. I find the Shure's comfortable enough. However, they never ""disappear"" like my Sennheiser's. The memory wire takes some work to make them fit, and it takes a bit of practice to get them on quickly. The earphones themselves may be large for people with small ears. For me, it barely fits (I have small ears), but I don't really notice the size. The foam tips should be inserted like ear plugs to get a good seal. The headphones are much more comfortable one everything is adjusted to fit you.

Noise Isolation (5/5): Wow! I couldn't even hear a band playing across the quad, especially one the music is playing even at low volumes. These headphones also completely blocked out someone trying to talk to me. Great for disappearing into your own world and for airplanes. Bad for walking in traffic...

COMPARISONS:
Vs. Klipsch S4i: I found the Shure's to be an absolutely upgrade to the Klipsch's, even though they do not cost that much more. Clarity and detail overall are significantly better on the SE215's. The Klipsch's are muddier and sound veiled in comparison. However, if you like more ""fun"" headphones, the Klipsch's may still be a better choice for its booming bass and generally V-shaped sound signature.

Vs. Audio-Technica ATH-M50x: I found these to be comparable in overall sound quality, with a slight edge to the ATH-M50x, especially in the highs and soundstage. Bass is full and controlled on both. Mids are a little more forward on the Shure's.

Vs. Sennheiser HD598: My HD598's are the standard against which I compare other headphones (until I upgrade those anyways...). Here, I still find the Sennheiser's to be the superior headphones. However, they definitely excel in different areas. Clarity and detail are won by the Sennheiser's hands down. Soundstage is massive on the HD598's, so they win there as well. Even the mids, which the Shure's excel at, are a bit more clear and intimate on the Sennheiser's. The Shure's, however, do win in the bass department. People claim that the HD598's have a flat sound signature, and they do for the most part. But there is a definite dip in the lows (just look at a frequency response graph). If there is a thumping bass line, it will be much more enjoyable on the Shure's. But I still love my HD598's :)"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to be a Sony guy, but wasn't able to find current earbuds with good consistent reviews. I've seen these Shure earbuds around for a while and seemed to have a good reputation.

There are plenty of earbuds included. My favorite are the foam buds that are kind of like memory foam. These help block external noise so well! I'd never seen those before so I was immediately impressed.

Being able to disconnect the earphones from the cable is a nice touch in case your cable ever goes bad, which happened to a different pair of Sony's I had many years ago.

These things are really great. I listen to music between 5-12 hours during my work shifts and they never cut out like my Sony's did; and those were about $50 more.

There are only a couple things I don't like about these is that they have to wrap over your ear. It can make quickly removing them a hassle and a little discomforting. The other is that changing the earbuds can be difficult. I don't do it often, but when I do I'm afraid I'm going to grip them wrong or apply to much force and tear them. I haven't yet, so maybe something to just be aware of.

I would recommend these to anyone in a heartbeat."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now become a member of the 3 months-and-they-fail club, as several other reviewers have experienced. A long time fan of the Shure SE wired monitors, I had hoped this bluetooth adapter would be a pleasant mobility solution, so I purchased the SE215 bundle to try it out.

Using HD FLAC recordings the sound quality is just fare, suitable for the gym and commuter trains but not for serious listening, although after trying a number of BT listening devices none have risen to great heights of acoustic performance as yet.The SE215 BT is about in the middle of the pack, and not as good as I had hoped. The controls are a little clumsy, but ultimately workable. The status voice is fine, until the battery runs low when it becomes more of a nagging nuisance than if the headset simply shut off.

As noted above, the unit has now failed completely after three months of moderate use. It will neither charge or turn on. I'll update this note after talking with Shure customer support, but at present I don't recommend these because of the apparent inconsistent build quality."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am glad to have a genuine Shure product, because I know it won't harm my in-ear monitors and (at least so far) has the power and clarity necessary to drive the Shures. But the power-on process for these things is beyond annoying. I have a Google Pixel 2, and after powering on the Shure bluetooth teather, it connects to my phone in about 3 seconds. At that time, the music or podcast starts to play, and everything is cool. But about 1-2 seconds later, a female voice pipes up -- over my music or podcast! -- announcing that it has connected. Well no kidding, Sherlock! I have thus far not found any way to disable this unhelpful announcement.

Then, on the power-down side of things, holding the button first tries to act as the ""Google assistant"" or some such, and only by holding it down further do you finally get the double-tone indication that it is powering off. I would think just tapping the button would be sufficient for ""hey let me talk to the cloud"" and holding it down would honor the age old tradition of ""hold down the power button, and the electronic thing powers off.""

Separately, as mentioned I find the sound richness to be better than I was expecting after hearing all the bad things about other bluetooth connections. I find the volume to be plenty for my walking through the city. The battery life seems to be sufficient for a whole week, where it is used for my walk to work and walk back in the evening."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was fine, but the cable layout was awkward. As you can see in the picture, it's asymmetrical, with the volume/power bit on the right side. The part that says ""Shure,"" which likely contains the battery and some circuitry, hangs low. There's a piece that can clip both together, but the actual wearing is uncomfortable at best."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you think of a group of people who need perfect audio in a demanding environment with excellent isolation, a group that comes to mind is live stage performers. These are not earbuds - they're in-ear monitors, and holy crap does it show. They're Shure's entry level IEM with only a single driver, but they sound absolutely stunning - there's no comparison between these and your standard earbuds whatsoever. I use one of the silicone ear pieces (it comes with 4 or 5 sets), and when they're in, absolutely all external sound is blocked, even without audio coming through. They fit into your ears in such a way that I don't know how you could fail to insert them properly (which is a bit issue with other earbuds not getting a good seal and sounding poor), and the cable near the earpiece has a slightly stiff wire in it so that it forms over your ear, further securing it. The earpiece is designed in such a way that you can wear earmuffs or lie on your side and they do NOT jam the earphones into your skull (which was one of my bigger complaints with other designs), and the wire is replaceable in case it gets damaged. Only note is that the cable is a thicker than your average earbuds - which doesn't bother me (and makes it more resilient), but is something other people have mentioned they wouldn't like."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the option of wireless for my 535's. The sound quality is just as clear as wired and no sound delay with videos.

I would give 5 stars if not for the design of the wireless wire. Disappointed in the design with the extra piece hanging down. Other wireless earbuds only have the one piece with the controls and mic. I'll gladly put up with this if it holds up well and truly does give close to 8 hours on a charge.

Edit: so I moved this rating to a 5. Initially I complained about the bulkiness of the additional battery pack on the cable. But after seeing the lack of play hours on other wireless cables without the battery pack, I'm thankful it's there. I've been using the cable for 5 days and really like and highly recommend it."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So very disappointed. I couldn't get these to even be recognized in bluetooth scan by Galaxy S5 Active phone despite numerous attempts and ""fixes"".
Got them to pair with an Amazon tablet but then of course the remote would not work for volume or to advance track/chapter or pause!
Have yet to find bluettoth earbuds which work. I would be willing to pay far more, if they would just work!!!!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these one stage for a gig in a really noisy Greek restaurant playing acoustic mic'd instruments for in-ear monitors for all 4 band members. While I found them very comfortable and easy to use, others had a hard time figuring out the over-the-ear wire. If they'd bothered to read the instructions, it would have been pretty easy to figure out, but they kept trying to put them in the wrong ears and upside down like you would the lame earbuds from an iPlod or something.

Even though these are the ""base"" model, they sound great, even when just using them as headphones. I tested them out at home for 3 hours the night before and they were really comfortable and I don't usually like wearing earbuds for more than an hour or 2. The foam cushions come in several sizes so even if your ears are huge or tiny, something should work for you."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earbuds for the past several months as my daily headphones. I'm very happy with them - they provide great sound quality, excellent (if unintended) passive noise cancellation, and are easy to clean. I use these while walking but prefer more comfortable, higher quality over-the-ear headphones while at home or working at a desk as these can be a bit uncomfortable with prolonged use.

I'll agree with other reviewers in saying that getting them in your ear the first few times can be a bit difficult but you get the hang of it fairly quickly. As with most earbuds, these come with a variety of covers - both foam and rubber - to get your desired fit. The covers that came with the earbuds - I think they were foam, I don't really remember - were difficult to get off and I accidentally ripped the foam off in the course of trying to get them off. The covers in general are a little difficult to get off - my only complaints about these. Also included is a nice, branded fabric case which I use to carry the buds in.

I think the price is a bit high for what you get but I'd still recommend them for anyone looking for a step up from $5 earbuds or Apple's included earbuds for listening to music."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bit on the pricey side but they work great at isolating noise this will save my ears working in a shop. I keep them run through my shirt into my pocket where my iPod sits. Fit comfortably in my ears all day with the smallest of the included buds. No longer have to blast my music just to cover the outside noise. Worked great on a 9 hour flight at isolating the noise as well.

Edit: I lowered my rating from 5 to 3 (2.5 is closer to my actual feelings) stars because the first pair of headphones I received, noticed that where the cable attaches to the post that goes into my iPod was broken causing music to skip when moved or jiggled. These were replaced by Shure for free. Now less than a year later the problem is happening again and I now have to pay to return them to Shure to have them (hopefully) fixed and returned for me. While its nice that they will hopefully honor the warranty I now have to wait a week or so to have them back. If these were cheap headphones I would not care, but considering I have had $15 dollar headphones stand up to far worse daily beatings, and still work. It is just unacceptable. If you want a good pair of headphones for travel or minimal activity these may be for you. If your searching for good, noise isolating headphones, that can stand up to daily use you may want to keep looking."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is unfair to Shure, as the Ear Phones sound fantastic I have Beats, Bose, JBL., Sennhouser, plus Bose, Sony, and Klipsch ear phones, over ear head phones, even out the ear.I have been an audiophile 50 years and these Shuires go head up with them all without dropping a $1000. For shoppers in the market,how is your hearing? I'm lucky my hearing is sharp enough to discern the sound reproduction of the headphone. When asked by Dan Rather if he still listened to music Gregg Allman replied of course but only with head phones. That is my preference too.. As good as these Shure earphones sound, I hate the cord, you have to wrap it over your ear then plug in. Good Luck I just jam them in my ears and rock out..Because of the fitting using earphones while working out, even walking stay away. Important my question about hearing if you have any ear problems especially loss, don't buy $100 + ear phones Drop $20 for a set of Skull Candy and rock out .."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying I am incredibly satisfied with the overall audio quality of these headphones. I have owned a plethora of various in ear headphones and these are hands down the finest audio quality. If my review were based upon that factor alone it would be a 5 star. The problem is that I purchased these headphones mid June 2015 and I have already purchased 2 cable replacements. I bought these based on the idea that instead of having to drop money every few months on headphones I would have a durable pair that would last at least a year (which I have found is a reasonable length of time based on the usage and wear I put on headphones and the previous cheaper headphones I have had last longer) but I have been very disappointed. As of yesterday my second replacement cable had an ear bud stop working just as on the first replacement. This is highly disappointing because I do really like the headphones but considering that my $100 pair of headphones is now $160 pair and soon $190 if I decide to replace the cord again. I use them fairly strenuously but I take good care of them, leaving them in the case when they are not in use. I will be contacting the company to see what they have to say and will update when I have a response."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second set of the SE-215's I have own the first pair broke the sound tube, they still work but I can no longer fit a sleeve on it. These are very tough earphones, The replaceable cable are the big deal. I love the Etymotic's but they no longer have replaceable cables, and it is the cables that fail. With the Shure just purchase new cables My first pair had one fail at just over a year of use the next 2 where chewed up my Jimmy the Irish Terrier. they sound great, and as I have said heavy duty tough."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with these ear buds.
I use them while motorcycle riding. They work well to diminish wind noise while providing nice clarity and sound separation-better than in-helmet speakers or standard ear buds."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great neutral sonic quality, sound stage, and comfort. Wish the wires were a bit more durable, though they are replaceable which is a plus (though expensive which is a minus)."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great, only knock is that cords are very rigid. Over ear placement is nice once in but a bit awkward to put in. Very solid product for the price range"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these in-ears! The sound isolation is great and they sound amazing! There are a few times that they've maybe sounded a little muddy, but that's very rare. I've used these both as headphones and as in-ear monitors for live performance. They perform great in both areas! Would definitely recommend!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really mediocre for the price. It takes forever to get them to fit right and even afterwards, your ears feel congested with sound.

UPDATE: These require some getting used to. After a while, your ears adjust and they become easier to wear. I might update to 5 stars if they get even better with time."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty great, made even better by buying the iphone cable as well as in ear plugs to replace the default tips (find them in the suggested items)."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice quality , but a little annoyance putting on and taking it off"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, these are good options for sound isolating earphones. I use these in a live church service setting as in ear monitors. The quality is good but have had some problems with crackling in one of them. I have read and believe it could be the connection point between the earbud and the wire. The others work fine. Overall happy with them and work well for our needs."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,great quality in-ear headphones. Make sure you try all of the different changeable pieces that comes with it to find the one that fits best in your ear!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones 1) have great audio quality, I am always hearing details music that I never hear on my 5.1 THX audio system at home and 2) The sound isolating works incredibly well for me with the foam earbuds (included). I can be in a room of people talking and literally hear nothing. My friends will make fun of me and yell my name and say foolish things about me, and I have never noticed until they wave their hands in front of my face. Great headphones for getting in the zone for computer work.

I had Klipsch Image S4i's before these and these Shure blow them away."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The stock cord is abysmal. Buy one without the wire guided cords and inline controls for $15 on ebay.

Sound quality is excellent for everyday listening. I think that they give me the most I could possible get out of my music streaming services (about 300kbps). However if I were to invest in a DAC I don't think that they would improve by much.

Also the sound isolation is ridiculous. Could easily take out the cords and use them as earplugs."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had some difficulty putting this on at first but i got used to it and overall they work great.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to listen to this Shure IEM. So many great reviews, not only from Amazon, but from all over objective review sites.
HOWEVER, when I received it, I immediately test it. Fit wise it was great. very tight and it was truly sound isolating earphone. But THE LEFT EARPHONE WAS BROKEN!. I could not hear anything from it, so when I fidgeted it the wire that was connected to the left earbud, it was working momentarily and as soon as I moved my head, it stopped working.
so, I am returning today.
so much expectation and so much disappointment. Shure should have much better QC on these models."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely pleased with both the sound isolating function and the dynamic sound quality. Once properly positioned in your ear these earphones tend to stay in place. Getting accustomed to how these fit in your ear took me a bit of time but well worth the effort. Very happy with my purchase.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earphones for the past 2 years and ordered three sets of them. As everyone else has stated, the sound quality is fantastic, but that's not what I want to focus on. I want to talk about the design. I've had 100% failure rate with these within a year and all due to the shoddy connection between the earpiece and the cable. The audio becomes intermittent or cuts off whenever I move, which is unacceptable. It uses a clicking connector where there is a central lead and the outer rim acts as the other lead. It seems to be gold-coated so there aren't corrosion problems, but these leads loosen over time. I use these carefully in the office or while doing homework so I'm definitely not abusing these. I think what's happening is that as you use these earphones, the slight tolerances shimmy the connections wider over time. I'm also sure there is some friction that wears these parts thinner. You can buy replacement cables that solve half of the problem for a few months, but do I really want to drop a large fraction of the cost of these earphones on cables like that? I'm giving this one star because it has a serious engineering problem that makes failure a guarantee."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like nice sounding audio. These are incredible clear, clearest in-ear phones i have ever had. Only downside is the way in which they fit in your eat. Not exactly comfortable or easy to pop in and out. I like the technology and the looks, just not the comfort."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm use to using the 425s provided to me on stage with an Aviom, which works well together. I already purchased my own memory foam ear tips to avoid stranger danger in the earwax department. Since they are all breaking through heavy use though, it was time for me to get my own pair to have in case needed.

I totally was taken aback when I plugged this personal pair into a device at home without all the adjustable levels on the Aviom. I mean, my SkullCandy $30 set has a more tolerable balance by far! I have sensitive ear canals, so I'm wondering the process of trying out a gazillion ear tips, including the extra order of the 3-tiered white silicone ones, has caused my perception to be irritated in general. I would almost classify it as an overstimulated sensation. The Shure's are truly louder than the cheeper sets I have, not limited to the above mentioned. I guess you could say they are really fuller in retrospect. I think maybe I need to get used to this to appreciate it, and I'm just overwhelmed with sorting the sounds right now. There is no difference in balance between the los, mids, and his for me at this point. They're all there, but they blend to an almost unison level. Can you say ""mono?""

One thing I did learn is that the ear tips make a HUGE difference on anything past the mids getting through. I'm finding the best sound, and honestly comfort, with the memory foam ear pieces. Nothing is beating the memory foam with these for balance. The positive for me is the way I can receive the vocals in my ear in spite of a very loud environment. Sitting here at home, nothing more than the UPS man delivery making my dog bark and my refrigerator humming, really shows me these are more of my stage ears, not so much my recreational choice. Maybe my ears will become more seasoned over time, maybe not."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantatic!
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The right ear piece died after a week. Amazons response? Send it back. No issues, no hassles. Typical for Amazon. Which is why I've already purchased another set from them. I'm using them on my motorcycle for music, phone, etc. Sound isolation is pretty decent, even at freeway speeds."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always great quality from Shure. I've trusted this brand with my ears for like 3 years now and have moved up to the se315 like a year ago.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my Shure 215. It plugs onto earpiece in seconds.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching for high quality headphones that will stay in-place while exercising and running. I have tried numerous different high-end brands and styles. The Shure SE215-K are the first headphones that I can honestly say, live up to what they claim. They are great quality, producing very clear, crisp sound, while staying in-place during exercise and running. I would highly recommend the Shure SE215-K headphones to anyone having similar challenges."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used these at work and could not hear any of the loud mouth people around me. Work great on the plane too. It's like having ear plugs in and listening to music. Prefer them over my bose noise canceling headphones on the plane actually
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE-215 earbuds are very sturdy and sound good. They fit flush to the ear, and they block sound without being uncomfortably deep into the ear. They are very comfortable and light--so much so that you almost forget that they are there.

They come with standard accessories like differently-sized foam and silicone tips, carrying case, and cleaning tool.

The 3.5mm jack is pretty wide, so you may not be able to plug these headphones into a phone with a thick case on it.

The 64-inch cable is pretty thick and should hold up to the damages of daily use.

All-in-all, these are good headphones for the price, and they are definitely worth a try."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolation is wonderful, but the in ear comfort and sound quality is not at good as I expected, granted the sound quality is far superior to standard headphones, but I had higher expectations for these. Wearing the headphones for long periods of time can become mildly uncomfortable. To clarify I am not an audio expert or a musician, just my own opinion for a consumer headphone. I could see these being really great for on stage monitors."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds period. The foam tips need some breaking in at first but after a few days you can wear these until 6 hours because thats when your ear starts feeling sore. The sound is right where it should be, clean treble and bass, none of that scratchy sound you get from most earphone products these days"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, good selection of earpiece sizes, good noise isolation, good sound quality for music and spoken. I bought these because I heard they were good for people with smaller ear canals, and I am pleased. They fit under my over-the-ear headset at work and remain comfortable for hours."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphone quality was very good, had a clear and crisp sound that I had never experienced with previous earphones. However, the quality of the wires were sub par and broke within a few months of ownership. The wires themselves are very sturdy and well built, but the wireform (the bendy metal part near the earpiece) was cheap and broke easily. If you're using your headphones a lot, this might not be the best choice for you, because I would rather not pay 30 bucks for a new wire every time the WireForm fit breaks."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these on airplanes and trains. I'm happy with the sound quality, and the sound isolation is so excellent that I can enjoy listening to chamber music (which has a huge dynamic range) in these noisy environments.

I don't like them for walking around the city. In this situation, the isolation is almost TOO good, and I don't feel safe being so cut off from my surroundings. I just use my cheapo white earbuds here.

Also not great in the gym or puttering around the house.The foam part wedges deep into the ear canal, while the wire loops over the back of the outer ear, so if you accidentally catch the wire on something and they get suddenly yanked out, it hurts! I prefer my cheapo white earbuds.

These are also not the first thing I grab when listening to music on the sofa in my relatively quiet home. After a while, my inner ear starts to feel really hot and stuffy, so here I prefer my old Sony over-ear headphones.

But they are great for airplane and train trips."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, fit well, and look awesome. Love them, I wish they came in a wireless version."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just lost my Weston um10 so I decided to try this out. Not as comfortable as um10, sound is okay but I expected more. Though cable looks like it could last. Anyway, the price performance ratio is okay."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR
Worth the 100. Not as full bodiedon the low end of the frequency chart. (If that's something you are looking for)

I have an 11 year old set of Shure IEMs (They're still going strong).
I also have a set of Beat Solos I'll be basing my opinion of the 215s and Old IEMs to the Solos.

I use headphones primarily for my Roland TD30, but I will also come back to review the sound attenuation ability when I play with an acoustic set.
I use the small, rubber inserts provided by Shure.
Right off the bat, These are great quality for the price.
First thing I Notice:
The Higher and Mid frequencies, seem to be more prominent compared to Beats.(Expected, Beats are marketed more for low end heavy hip hop)

First thing I did was youtube ""headphone test"" and The ""Luigi Barber shop"" came up, so I tried it. The whole beginning Scared the bajesus out of me! I kept looking over my shoukder to see if someone was in the room with me. These head phones really were crisp and the isolation of ambient noise really made you feel like you were in the barber ahop."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"sounds great, best design for fitting in the ear and not causing soreness to any part of your ear. There is somewhat of a learning curve to get them to fit correctly."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, i read a lot of reviews and compared with lot of other products in the price range, nothing can come close to this, just try these and you wont be dissapointed."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had five SHURE in-ear headphones over 5 years. The SE215 will be my last. Each one has had a similar problem - with the connector dieing and losing sound to one of the ear buds, usually the left. The sound, feel and fit are great. But I can not recommend them on durability. All my SHURE have lasted approximately a year. So bear in mind when you buy them - if 1 year is OK for the price, I can recommend them. If not, then look elsewhere. Thus the 3 stars instead of 1."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a while I had the Klipsch S4 earbuds, and I was perfectly content until the left ear gave out. I debated whether I should 'upgrade' or pick up a new pair of S4s. In the end, I decided to go with these Shure SE215s, and they do not disappoint! I was skeptical if I would notice a difference from the S4s, especially given their high ratings. I'm glad to report, there certainly is a difference.

The high notes are crisp and the lows are perfectly balanced, with a hearty bass. Best of all, I'm noticing nuances in the music that I have not heard before. These are a great pair of in-ear monitors, I highly recommend."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it...great sound and decent battery life.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It could just be me. I didn't quite know how to modify the ear buds to fit in the right direction in my ears. The sound seems to be amazing, but I struggled so much with the ear phones that I had no choice but to send it back."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received these earphones 41 days ago and haven't used them a dozen times yet and the left ear bud doesn't work 95% of the time. Can't return them because I'm outside the 30 day return policy. Expected much better quality for $99.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound no better then a $20.00 pair from the Flea Market. Too Bad.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is a lot better that many in ear headphones I had in the past. The materials are excellent. The price is expensive compared to similar new products that cost a quarter or less, like: https://www.amazon.com/Earphone-Headphones-Running-Eartips-Microphone/dp/B00Y0F6IBG"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I've had for the price.. Far superior to the bose I had! Noise cancelation is great and the sound is wonderful (outstanding bass)! I use them for working out and the block all the surrounding noise out. You can even wear them to bed and not notice they're in.. Definitely worth the money
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful build quality. They feel cheap, and both my headphones stopped playing any sound after less than two weeks of moderate use. Only used them sitting down at work, then coiled them up and put them in my pocket for a few weeks. Apparently that's too rough for these headphones to handle. Don't buy these if you want something that lasts."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic. I ride the subway every day and the noise isolation is great. They fit comfortably and they make talk radio and heavy base music alike sound amazing. The cables are the sturdiest of any headphones I have ever had ... as if that isn't enough, they are also replaceable. The noise isolation is far better than Klipsch s4 headphones and they are just as comfortable. Noise isolation is on par with Etymotic m3 headphones, but these are far more comfortable. I did notice some cable noise with these headphones but it seems to be coming from the behind-the-ear portion, which is a bit ""springy."" Overall, these are by far the best $100 and under headphones I have owned thus far."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, bought these to drown out my annoying co worker that sits on the side of me and never stops talking. Put these babies in and boom silence. Granted he then proceeded to start waving infront of my face... But one problem at a time"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for some headphones for the gym that were a step up from the 10-15$ pairs of headphones that I usually buy, most meeting their demise by me destroying the cord. The replaceable cord was a big seller for me and this is very reasonable bang for buck option that has a replaceable cord.

I've never listened to more than a 10-15$ pair of in ear monitors prior to this purchase. I'm floored by the sound. Even my wife who claims she can never hear the difference between any speakers that I have auditioned in the house or in a car commented how good they were."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are not as pretty as my other in-ear headphones but they are by far the best ones I own. They are able to keep out the noise on the subway (including the performers and crying babies). The foam does not look pretty but its the exact material my Hearos ear plugs, so they are so comfortable and stays in my ears-- amazing! I got great sound and comfort from these!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really hated earbuds. But after using this I can't believe I've spent all this time without them. This are the best I've heard in my life. Do your self a favor and buy them asap. Only downside I've found is that now I want to try the other more expensive models.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best sounding Wireless headphones out. Way better than the B&O, Bose, and garbage BEATS. I had the regular SE215's and decided to get these as my workout pair. Great Decision. These feel really good, while running, Boxing, Lifting etc."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've had many pairs. They are great but the newer iterations have taken the beats path and boosted the base and limited the mids unfortunately.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones and hope to enjoy them for a long, long time. I really appreciate headphones with replaceable cords. I read a lot of reviews before choosing these. The only downside is that they aren't compatible with the more heavy duty cases."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe these headphones have good sound quality if they can fit in your ears. But they did not fit in mine comfortably or lock-in even after over an hour of trying to put them in.

Buyer beware that these are not very comfortable and may not fit your ears."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my old Shure buds bit the dust (the cord cracked and there was exposed wire), I tried buying 2 different buds. The Klipsch and Beats. Neither came close in highs and lows. The noise isolation is great, which is important to me. I want to hear the music, not background noise. I highly recommend Shure buds!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! But right out of the package my right bud has been cuting in and out. Not the worst situation but not great considering the price paid for these.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my solution to a noisy office where people close by talk. Blocks out considerable amount of talking. The white noise that I play sounds great (for white noise). The part that fits in the ear, right outside the ear canal, is a bit large for my tiny ears. Hurts a little and takes a little while to get them in and out."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through my share of ear buds and Shure makes the most durable snug fitting buds I've found to date. I'm 6' tall and the cord length is perfect. A dropped player has its momentum broken just before hitting the ground, and unlike other headphone cables, the cord can take it. The replaceable cord is a great feature. Though a bit expensive for a cord, it beats having to replace the entire setup. I'm no expert, but sound quality is as good as anything else as far as I can tell. Wearing these buds makes me feel superior as I watch all the crappy-ass ear bud people around me. Don't be a loser. Pony up the few extra shekels to get a quality product."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wearing it takes a bit of getting used to but it produces really great sound! Noise cancelling is really excellent, definitely not something you wanna wear while going for a run, be carfeul when you're crossing the road =P"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok I am a motorcyclist. First let's talk about helmets. For a helmet to work it must fit snugly on your head. That means when you put it on it will graze your ears as you slide it over your ears. If it doesn't your cheek pads are too thin. If you can pull on each side of the helmet as you slide it on and separate it so it doesn't graze your ears you have one of those cheap helmets or you're a Harley rider with a beanie.
So I put the earbuds on and each time I slide the helmet over my ears it flips the wires off my ear and pulls the earbuds out, and yes I am using the triple flanges. I have always had triple flange buds and have never had this problem. Triple flanges are the most important thing to eliminate wind noise on a motorcycle. Another thing I noticed is that when putting these phones into my ear it takes two hands, one to push it in and another to hold the wire over my ear, this is not acceptable. This means I can't ride my bicycle and remove one to talk to someone.
This wire over the ear is a selling feature but it really is not needed. My buds have always had a clip on them, you attach the clip to your shirt or helmet strap and it yanks on the clip and doesn't pull the buds out of your ears, problem solved.
These are going back."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these a few years ago, still sound great! Cable did go on me(accidentally broke the connector) but was swapped out, they work, sound great and are easily the best sounding/lasting headphones. If it was not for the shape of these, I could use them for longer periods of time. The Klipsh Image S4's are just as good, but function better for longer time"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I read a lot of reviews both positive and negative before taking the plunge on these, and I'm really glad I did. It certainly helped with my initial experience - the truth is they really do take some getting used to putting them in. Past that the only caution I would give is if you wear glasses they feel a little awkward. Otherwise, they have immaculate sound and are built very well. Great investment!!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Picked up the SE215s to replace Bose Noise Canceling over ear headphones. I was tired of the Noise Canceling hiss and was tough to sleep on a plane with huge headphones. These have proven to be a great alternative and couldn't be happier.

Some people complain in-ear headphones can hurt after a while, but honestly, I have no issues. From rock to hip-hop, to classical to the Grateful Dead these are far and away my favorite purchase in a long time. They're small, pack in a nice little case and take up a 1/10th of the room in my carry-on as the Bose. Took a little time to get used to putting them on, but the noise isolating is awesome and the hiss is gone -

I'm sure there are a lot of audiophiles out there that will find something wrong with anything, but I can say they are a great sounding set of monitors and am really happy with the purchase. Great build quality, strong cable and nice sound. For $100 they're a great option. And if I accidentally leave them on the plane I can buy 2 more pair before I get to the price of the Bose."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for durability based on some reviews and articles and I was severely disappointed there. This set only lasted me around 6 months like any average set would under normal use. The sound wasn't very good either for the price. I would look else where for durable headphones or good sound.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for worship team with the Aviom monitors. They have amazing sound and fit perfectly in my small ears. Easy to clean and very easy to use! Great price!
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I reviewed the Beats earphones favorably but these Shure phones are kickass. Very well balanced with good bass and excellent highs. they block out sound well and stay in position under my motorcycle helmet. Love 'em.

Cons: I found these earphones to be no better than a cheap pair of standard Apple earphones. I spent an entire day listening to music with them, I tried a plethora of different types of music. I usually just wear standard Apple earphones. After a full day of listening, I went back to my apple pair to see if I could tell the difference. I played the same songs at the same times for the highs, lows, mids and bass. I heard no difference in any of these other than bass. The bass didnt help though because it just overpowered the others. I had a friend try the same tests to make sure I was crazy and his exact words were "" I literally hear no difference"".

If you're looking for a sturdy pair of headphones with cheap sound, these are the way to go. If you want much better sound than your standard Apple pair, I would look elsewhere."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,From rap to rock these sound amazing. If you get the right fit with the ear peices then you love these. Best sounding earphones I have ever owned. If all you have ever listened with is the Apple EarPods then you are missing out on so much.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent balance in audio quality and price. I bought it for gigs but ended up using them for situations where there is a lot of noise around me like mowing the lawn and on airplanes.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my wife, they work great and have excellent sound. She uses them when we are reading in bed, I do not hear anything. Great for both of us."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound. They adjust to the ears like earplugs and the sound is pretty clean and nice. I'm looking forward to using them as stage monitors too.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,ok ear buds for just listening for middle and upper tones....no bass response....since I bought them to hear myself playing bass they were useless to me. I could hear everyone else but not me.....
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds. I've always been a fan of Shure electronics.The only bad thing is that the earbuds are detachable from the cord and can easily be lost. Replacements are almost the cost of a new set.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend have he loved them. He's big on getting earphones with great sound quality and he said these are just absolutely amazing.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 215 earbuds are the best earbuds that i ever bought. I've owned many earbuds, literally, but none like these. I'm new to the ""audiophile"" world and have not been very experienced with really good headphones but on the price margin I can say that these are the best out there. These buds out perform more expensive earbuds of its price range, especially the Beats by dre, no disrespect or hate intended but these headphones blow it out of the park."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love these but the way they sit in my ears, causes sore spots and had to switch to a different pair. also, a bit hard to keep the cables shaped comfortably around my ears"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear sound; replaceable wires. I use 'em at the gym, where the abuse is hard on the wires; the wires aren't all that cheap, but cheaper than buying a new set of not-so-good in-ear monitors."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is awesome. I ended up returning them though because they are a pain to put on. I gave it a few days of use just to see if it'll get easier but they are just not easy to put on. One of the sides also kept coming out.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product -- the sound quality is fantastic for the price. I purchased this back in Feb 2013 and I've had sound issues with the wire+speakers over the months. I contacted Shure about this and they fully replaced the product within 2 weeks. Great warranty coverage!
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but doesn't use any specific Bluetooth chipset, no APX or APX HD support. However it works and is a great buy for the sound. Just don't forget to grab a wired cable for times of low battery"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These were for my husband. He uses them for traveling. He liked that he could change the size of the insert to make it fit his ears properly. He says they are. Erg comfortable. This is his second pair. He lost the first set.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Slight learning curve to get them to stay in your ear. Too good for my music, definitely exposes the flaws in my low fidelity .mp3 digital library. Worth the price."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is a great brand. Second pair of these - I do a lot of outdoor running and lifting in the gym. Durable, never tangle, crystal clear sound."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5 stars, good goods! Thanks!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If I was stranded on a deserted island, these would be my top choice along with water."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound signature. Excellent base, warm meaty mids, and fresh, but not crackly highs. As soon as I took them out of the box, one side wouldn't connect. I wiggled the cable and it worked. Fast forward to two hours later. No sound from the right side of the headphone. I highly recommend you test the headphone immediately. This seems to be a problem with every shure IEM in this lineup. I was disappointed."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,In terms of sound I would give these earphones 5 stars. The quality is fantastic and they really do block out a lot of outside noise. My only issue is they are kind of a pain to put on given the shape and where the wires are supposed to fall.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality is decent but not as good as other in-ear headphones (Bose) that i've purchased. Having to try placing the wire behind the ear with long hair and glasses is difficult to do, it's a chore."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work great except for the tips. It was difficult to get them to completely seal inside my ear. I had custom molds done to fit these and was much better. I still prefer over the ears headphones.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality for this price. Need to get us to putting the buds in the ear because it can swivel..
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Second pair I've had within the last year where the left channel mostly died within a few months. Amazon replaced the first pair. I'm not even going to bother with these any longer, and just find some earbuds that will last. Sound quality while they lasted was ok, but the texture and fit of the earbud was weird."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using for a year, one of the wire sometimes not too often has the problem of connectivity (no sound on that side of course). Though the wire is replaceable, it is pretty expensive like 40 dollars. Anyway, it is easy to carry with. I usually take it in my pocket. The small bag provided greatly reduced the possibility of wire messing up with itself. One problem is that in a cold winter day like here in Michigan, the wire becomes really stiff if you know what i mean."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are cheaply produced. The will work a few months and stop working. The wires short out easily.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to the SE215 i had EC2 and SCL2s. Loved both of them but managed to lose them both. Frankly. at this point, I'm glad I did. The SE215s are the best sounding headphones I've ever had. Far superior sound to both the SCL2s and EC2s. Great separation, strong but not overly heavy bass. Highs and mid are clear, with somewhat airy and transparent presence.

Some have complained about this fit -it's possible that if your ears are small, they may not be comfortable. They are a very different kind of fitting headphone. The body of the ear piece fits in the belly of your ear. Looks almost like a hearing aid. For me, they are comfortable and i run the cable over my ear. This style is much more sound isolating then the previous SHures I mentioned.

Cable is a wee bit long, which is a bit of a hassle for working out. I need to get some kind of clip or run it under my shirt. Some folks complained about noise from the cables (rubbing against shirt, each other, etc). I have not experienced that noise.

Highly recommend. I love 'em."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've worn these for 8 hours at a time on long flights. Good sound and comfortable. The ear pieces keep them in pretty well, even when you nod off. One thing, be sure to keep them clean so the sound pipe doesn't clog with ear wax."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the money you can't have better then this. Very Good.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,2003. First pair thousands of miles in rain ' below zero weather '. 120 deg temps. Even indoors. Work like a champion that they are . 2015 Bought another pair
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,thank u!
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my absolute favorite before I got a custom in-ears, highly recommended if you want seriously awesome sounds in an earphones but can't afford a custom fit in-ears, yet - or you can just save up and get the custom in-ears right away… BUY THIS!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones, make sure to change the foam piece to fit your ear because it does get a bit snug."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my husband and they broke in less than 6 months. For the price I would think they should have lasted longer. I plan to reach out to the manufacturer and see if they can assist in repair/replacement.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down, really REALLY good headphones. I've had them over 5 years now & they still work 100% like they did out of the box. Sound quality & comfort is exceptional, & noise reduction is significant. I often use these while mowing (funny story re that later), & my exhaust decided to fall off my mower 1 day which resulted in an ABSURDLY loud 6+ hours mowing my giant lawn. Without these headphones this would be unbearable.

Now the funny story; couple months ago while mowing & listening to music, went to grab my phone to check the time & noticed it managed to fallout of my pocket & disappeared out of sight down into the depths of my mower. Music was still on & sounding fine, but needless to say I panicked & immediately shut everything off. After following the cord, I luckily found my phone sitting on top of a flat but EXTREMELY hot surface right above the blades (phew). It melted the crap out of the edges of my phone, & my beloved headphones cord, closest to where it plugs into the phone (see pic). Kid you not, at that point I had 100% accepted they were done for & I'd need to get a new pair. BUT, long story short, I'm overjoyed to report that they are in fact NOT done for, & are still somehow functioning as perfectly as they always have. I wrapped the damaged area with electrical tape & on we went!

In short, buy these TANK headphones that not only produce a wonderful listening experience, but can also somehow withstand being nearly destroyed & shrug it off. I would expect this level of performance from a product costing twice as much. Highly recommend.

**7/22/16 UPDATE - Headphones still going strong. Just wanted to add a couple notes that some might see as relevant. I mostly listen to talk-show type podcasts & progressive/nu-disco type (ie; Luke Fair, Soul Clap) mixes on Soundcloud. The range these are able to perform at is exceptional. Voice is crystal clear & bass is low & strong like it should be. I favor these over a pair of much more expensive Sennheiser over-ear headphones."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't normally give 5 stars very easily but truth to be told; these are high quality ear buds for this price range. I used to own vmoda to audio fly buds. While they are expensive at $100, they do add the potential value of these buds. At first, I didn't know how to wear them. From there, I simply read the card manual on how to do so. Only took a matter of one minute to learn. I love the fact you can detach these buds with ease. The simplicity of keeping the buds healthy for long term is pure genius. The simple fact ear buds headphones can get ruined from wear and tear while it wont happen likely due to the interchangeable cords.

Now as for the ear buds itself it's tangle free. I was worried whether if they were going to get tangled badly due to having a rubber like finish. Instead, they don't stick. Most importantly it's bound inside the cords of wires, fabricated cloth, and finally the rubber of its exterior.

The sound is where the love truly comes in. Pure, crisp, and detailed to note. These ear buds were made primarily to listen, enjoy your sound tracks to its full amount, or even play by ear when making music.

Comfort is all around 10/10 in itself. It doesn't slip off, stays on the ears, and good for long term use in the canals."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are durable as hell and will last a long time. In a week they went through: going through the laundry, being chewed up by my dog, and then slammed in a car door. They still work fine. My only issue is the wires. The wires are extremely durable, until you get to the part that is meant to bend around the ear. There is a thin metal band in it to keep the wire shape when you form it around the ear. After about 2-3 months, the metal will snap, and rip through the plastic. It will also cut some of the wires, making your music cut in and out at certain angles. This is a huge design flaw. Fortunately, they have a two year warranty. I have had to send them in for wire issues twice for the same problem, but each time they're replaced they work as new again. Make sure you keep the damn receipt guys. Print it, make multiple copies of it. You're gonna need it so you won't be paying for Shure's design flaws.

The sound quality is amazing. The bass is super punchy. It is average and good in the high ends and mids, but not poor. I am a bassist and I can clearly hear the bass line of every song, which is nice for me. I also practice bass with these, and the quality is perfect. Overall, sound won't be an issue.

The wires are meant to bend around your ears and both ear tip designs are super comfortable. I can sleep with these on because they don't protrude out. Comfort isn't an issue.

Overall: buy these. keep the receipt so you can easily replace them when the wires without a doubt break."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these based on the Shure brand (which is highly respected). However, these have a very flawed design. In order to get the ""in ear canal fit"" you have to really tweak these things into an angle that is uncomfortable and causes the cord (which is detachable) to detach. This is a pain in the rear especially if you are at the gym. I find myself spending more time trying to rearrange these rather than enjoying them.

A detachable cord is great in case the wireform cord wears out over time (which all will do) and then you can buy an inexpensive new cord to continue using the earbuds. However, they detach WAY too easily. A simply twist in your ear to get a tighter fit can cause it to fall off.

They also lack deep bass. If you listen to classical music these will be fine, but then again you probably would want an over-the-ear design for that.

These are NOT for working out, running, or anything where you are in motion. They are not comfortable and they lack bass."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a preface: I really like these headphones. The sound to price ratio is fantastic. Very comfortable, and the behind the ear cord has really won me over.

Now for the bad part: The sound often cuts out at the joint between the IEM and cord. Only happens when you move your head though - fine for those in traction. Looking through the forums, this is a fairly common problem thought to be caused by sweat or the connection becoming loose over time. I use these at my work desk, where I neither have reason to sweat or put any stress on the cable (haven't even been using them that long). Will experiment with some of the DIY fixes suggested on the forums, but for now I can live with it (wiggle the wire a bit). I hear this issue crops up with the entire line, so buyer beware at the high end (if I paid $500+ and this happened I would be livid - one star review regardless of sound).

That said, THIS set is $100, and although they have problems, I really do like them. It kind of balances out? Not sure whether I'd buy them again or not. Would definitely get the extended warranty."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, rather than writing it all out in paragraph form, I'll just bulletpoint everything. **Note: I am not a musician or someone with a great ear for acoustics, but I consider myself somewhat of an 'under $200' earbud connoisseur.**

Pros:
- play with the cushions they provide as one will fit - I use the medium memory foam ones and they have created a tight, but more important, comfortable seal
- wires are thick and well-made - I haven't experienced much disturbance or interference from touching them - they seem like buds an actual musician would wear on stage
- over top and around the ear wire placement is new for me, but it didn't take long to quickly get the hang of them
- the sound is top notch - deep bass, vocals are clear - again, I'm no audiophile, but I can't hear anything wrong
- case is handy for storage

Neutral:
- I thought I read somewhere that the wires didn't have to go over the ear, but I can't figure a way to have them just hang down. That said, as mentioned previously, I've gotten the hand of wearing them this way so it's not a problem now

No real cons I can think of at the moment. I've had the buds for a week now and am very happy with them.

That's my review. I'm John Pace and you're not."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Motorcycle Full Face Helmet Trick: When putting on my full face helmet, I could not get a good seal. The helmet pushes on my ears and earbuds, and opens a gap where sound gets through. By unlooping the rigid portion of the cable from behind my ear and using it as a spring to push between the helmet and the earbud, I can now get a perfect seal.

Pro Tip: Pull your ear lobe up and back to open your canal. Roll and massage the foam down like a foam earplug. Insert and hold into your ear canal, allow the foam to expand. If they don't muffle everything like an ear plug, try again.

Back story: I was not impressed with these. I bought them to protect my ears from noise, but they barely seemed to be better than normal earbuds. Well I had some time while sitting on a plane to try my luck and it turns out I only had them half inserted. The trick is to massage the foam and really open your ear up. Maybe I have small canals, or they turn sharply, but now that I have them in properly, they sound A-MAZE-ING."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great. I don't have golden ears, but I believe I can at least partly tell the difference between good and bad headphones/earbud. I loved my last pair, sony buds that I only replaced because the cord finally gave in after probably 6 or 7 years.

The complaints about putting these in are founded, but honestly, if you spend a little time practising, it's not complicated and you can find easier ways. Sometimes I'll put the cord over the ear first, then fold the bud into the canal. Other time, the opposite. I tug on my lobe with the thumb and ring finger and use my index finger to apply pressure on the body of the plug to seat it in my canal.

I do run with these in. They block a lot of sound, but not everything. I' pretty hyper vigilant about my surrounding when I'm running, so I'm usually very aware anyway. I wear them to listen to music while working in the workshop and it turned the quite loud combination of my radial arm saw + shop vac into an EXTREMELY manageable background sound, and I could still hear my son yell at me to shut it off when he wanted to ride his bike in the garage - all without taking away too much from the music.

In less than perfect settings, like resting my head against a pillow (or car seat) they do start to hurt a bit after about an hour. General wear, however, hasn't really had that effect.

The cord doesn't tangle remotely as much as my previous pair, but I hope to keep up the habit of winding them and putting them in the pouch that comes with them.
I got the ""black"", but they are transparent black. I'd rather opaque, but really, it's not a big deal.
I do sometimes wish the distance between the ""Y"" where the L/R cords connect was a little longer, again, it's not bothered me enough to dock points, really.
I'd actually give a 4.5/5 but don't feel the need to take away an entire star.

(Update)
7 months it made it without a hitch. Then the right side started to flake on me. I have to contort the wire and get lucky to get sound, which usually stays fine until I remove them and have to do it again the nest time I use them. I'll be returning to Shure for a replacement, but I have to say that my previous Sony pair, with near daily use, lasted 6-7 YEARS without issue, so this bothers me. I'm certain Shure will replace at least the cable, otherwise I'd be dropping more than the one star I took off. I'll update if I have other issues with the replacement process or otherwise."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Damn, who knew getting just the right ear bud at the right price would be so difficult. I run about 3 miles a day on a treadmill at my health club. If I can hear myself breath, or there is a cable thump or the bass is distorted or too shallow, or there isn't enough treble, or too much treble, or they are not loud enough, or they are too loud, or they are uncomfortable, I can't use them. Boy, now that I am reading my review I sound really picky. I guess that's cause i am with buds. I've tried; bose, Sony (not bad but not good enough) Yurbuds, Klipsh, an active type of Sony buds, Etymotics, Adidas Senheisers, and a bunch I can't even remember. All around the $100.00 to $125.00 mark. I have to admit that when I got these I was not overwhelmed but had resigned to using them as I was more tired of exchange and lost all hope that there was something great waiting for me to try. I used the white triple flange rubber earpieces (licked them before I put them it) and viola! I got a tight seal that provided the right mix for my exercise. I have to admit they are a bit of a pain to get into my ears at first, but when they're in, they're in for the duration. There is very minimal thumping and the cord tucks away over my ears around the back of my head so they never get tangled while in use. I think the people that complain about the cord are losers because it is a bit thicker but who cares as you never see it anyway. I've only had them for a few weeks but so far they are really eggsellent. Two thumbs up as long as you use the white flange ear tips. Oh almost forget, cut a smidge of the rubber from the end of the tuby like end of the flanges so they didn't reach so far in my ear and now they are comfy as all get out."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked these up after growing tired of metronome bleed during recording, and noisy practices overpowering some pretty crucial, ""need-to-hear-please"" parts of songs. Not surprisingly, they're amazing. The fit takes a little getting used to, as the cords connected to the buds put up a bit of resistance to folding over your ear, but once they're in, they're really in. Nearly dead quiet for ambient noise during recording, and snug enough to allow freedom of movement. The buds themselves are very comfortable, and I've yet to have any reason to pull them out of my ears other than being done with recording. The construction itself is very nice, and I particularly liked the disconnecting drivers, as storage is pretty simple with the included case once all is unplugged.

Sound quality is superb. Very transparent response across the low, mid, and high frequencies, which came as a very pleasant surprise from a single driver ear bud. Definitely a useful reference tool during mixes.

My only complaint is the cable length, but it's not an unusable length.

Overall, I love these headphones to death, and I'm sure they'll continue to see use with me over the years to come."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They broke after less than 2 weeks. Almost no sound comes out of the right side. And it seems to be the right bud itself since I tried my friend's cable and they're still dead.

I took great care of them, always carrying them in the pouch and only used them around 5 times total. Never been so disappointed, will be returning for a refund. I've had $5 earphones that lasted much longer."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would like to say I was kind of hesitant upon buying these since I never tried I near earbuds before in my life to think of it these are actually pretty good, funny thing is one of my ear conals are smaller than the other one which was ok because I had the sizes of the ear tips.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is considered by many to be the gold standard of microphones and audio products. And since their corporate headquarters is right near where I grew up, I was excited to try these earphones and didn't mind paying a premium for them.

I wish I actually liked them, but, alas, I really don't. I expected a rich, full bass and full-spectrum sound reproduction. Instead I found the bass was weak and the rest of the sound, while not poor by any means, simply didn't wow me at all. Worse yet, they are the most annoying earphones I've ever worn. Difficult to insert in the ear canal, they also have a wire designed to go up and around your ear to help hold them in place. While effective, it's not the easiest thing to put on compared to anything else I've ever worn, And more annoying is that the tiny earphone itself is actually detachable/replaceable so there's a tiny snap fitting that tends to rotate when you're trying to insert them in your ear. Like many things it takes some getting used to and after a while it becomes easier with practice, however, for my money, the annoyance factor, combined with the high cost and mediocre sound made these a real disappointment. Sorry, Shure, I'll keep an eye out if you come up with a better device, but this one just doesn't cut it for me."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't expect them to be such hard to fit. My ears are not large at all, but the part used to fix the plugs on ear is too short, making it really hard to fit."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound very good for the price. The noise canceling is also fantastic! Personally I found that they can get my ears a bit sore with prolonged use, but it may be different with different ears.
The fact that you can also fully replace the cable if it life ends up damaging it so these have an even longer life than normal due to that feature."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by stating that I do not consider my self an audiophile. I just have a particular sound signature that I like. I like some bass (leaning toward accurate, not overly enhanced) with nice full warm mids and non-sibilant highs.. I HATE sibilance.. I can now say that the SE215-K Fit the bill perfectly for me.
This was initially a rocky road for me. I found these to be extraordinarily uncomfortable for me and none of the supplied sleeves would seal properly for me. I tried the Comply brand sleeves and still no joy. Swallowing and side to side movements would break seal compromising sound. Next I tried the tri-flanged sleeves from Shure. Dear God I thought I was driving a 2 penny nail into my skull. The sound improved dramatically for the five minutes I could tolerate them. With the knowledge that I would never use these sleeves unless I felt a had to do a penance for some horrible wrong I had done, I went ahead and cut off the the first (smallest) flange with an Xacto knife, then braced myself and proceeded to jam these things into my ear. To my surprise all discomfort was gone, the seal was solid regardless of my heads position or what my jaw was doing. The next couple of days entailed me getting used to the idea that these where firmly in place and where not going to fall out. I found myself constantly checking the fit. The third day I could finally concentrate on the sound. I was quite impressed. I could make out different instruments in my Dave Matthews tunes that I could never distinguish before and Florence's ( of Florence + the Machine )voice was so warm and powerful and distinguished I was simply floored. One month of nightly listening and the sound has improved in regards to being able to distinguish instruments and the like. I actually fall asleep and lay on my side with these on every night. So far none of that dreaded noise cut off others experience from the wire connector. I find its much more stable to tighten the wires under the chin rather than behind the head.
Had my initial journey in getting a proper fitting sleeve for these things not have been so arduous I may have given it 5 stars. I'm very happy I didn't give up on them and return them. I'm so pleased I may upgrade to one of there higher end models when these wear out. (If I can get passed the significantly higher price tag)
Would I recommend these to my friends? Yes, with a caveat on finding the right fitting sleeves, Since I have all these extra lying about I would let them try before they buy.

Have a Great One!!

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbelievable sound! These are great at drowning out background noise. For only around $100, they are totally worth it. They are also very high rated on head-fi.org, the foremost authority on headphone quality."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"cord durable, but very heavy. fell out of my ear"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for someone else. I tried them and the sound quality was very good as well as the noise isolation. It wasn't complete but to 35dcb. Therefore only could rate a 4. Also a little clumsy getting them adjusted to your ear.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these a shot. I have Shure 425, and an iPhone X, so I was excited to make my premium Shure headphones wireless. First, let me say that my view of Shure as a brand was very high. At $99, this was a expensive, but given the Shure name, my expectations were high. I had considered other MMCX compatible wireless settings such as Westone and other much cheaper 3rd party, but didn't like the lack of multipoint Bluetooth in the Westone and others.

Also -- one other note... I don't write 1 star reviews. I also rarely return stuff. This product was an exception disappointment. I would return but I'm about a week outside the 30d return window All told, I have use these for maybe 3 hours, each time thinking it must get better.. but it never did. The eye opening experience is when I put my AirPods back in and realized how much better they sounded -- that's saying something....

Pros:
-Wireless - Ahh... my headphones are wireless. I guess that is something.

Cons:
Virtually everything that matters...
- Sound quality -- there is a noticeable drop in audio quality from wired. My Apple AirPods (which are good, but not great headphones) have superiors audio quality to the wireless Shure.
- Form - There are several bumps in the wire (the control and the battery pack). I'm not sure how you are suppose to wear these, but they are always in the wrong spot. If you lean down, this giant battery pack comes swinging around your neck. I'm a big dude and these just never fit right.
- Price - No way this is worth $99. I would buy the cheapest MMCX headphone adapter and give it a shot... it can't be much worse.

No comment
- Battery -- I can't comment on battery life since I couldn't stand to wear them long enough to get thru even 1/2 a battery.
- UI -- The user interface is just fine. Power button is pseudo intuitive. Pairing is pseudo intuitive. Audio UI guidance in headphones is fine."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love! I have been using these earphones for a couple months now and I haven't had a problem with them. The sound is clear and it does a great job of blocking out unwanted sounds. I sing on a worship team and normally stand right in front of the drums. Since using these earphones, I haven't had a problem with the drums overpowering every one else. So happy!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,No longer working bought in November
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an earbud problem. And by that I mean, for many years, I purchased what felt like at least 1 pair of earbuds a month...mainly for working out but also to drown out my surroundings (and sometimes people I didn't want to hear). As a college student, durability and noise isolation were important...but I also didn't have several hundred dollars to drop on a pair of earbuds. These things were exactly what I was looking for: detachable, braided, really strong cable that seemed like it could both withstand a lot, and, importantly, could be replaced if it broke. You see, every month, I'd go through a pair of earbuds and the cord would break on something. An elliptical machine, a bicycle peddle, getting caught on something and ripping. It was rarely the actual earbud that failed. Just the freaking cord. So, I was really happy to get something where the cord could be replaced.

But if that was all these things were good for, I wouldn't be writing this review. I've owned various qualities of earbuds--klipsch X10s, various sennheisers, bose...and these things sound AMAZING. I now have a triple driver Westone W30, and, well, these don't beat that. But, those cost $400, and the difference is NOT amazingly significant. I have no idea how Shure made what are likely relatively cheap dynamic drivers sound this good. I say that because...these things cost $90, and the quality of the cord, construction, and multitude of earbud tips themselves probably come to around $40. Then lets assume a $10 profit, and they've got $40 for two drivers...so these could well be $20 drivers. Yet, they sound as though they're hundreds of dollars (once you get the right eartip fit). Not only that, they freaking don't break. Now, being my clumsy self, I've still managed to break the cord a few times, but I was able to replace that. And they've endured myriad of sweat and grime that I've thrown at them through my daily activities. They're still going strong more than 2 years later. And when I did have an issue with them, Shure's customer service was responsive, fast, and efficient.

In summary...these things sound great, don't break, you can replace the cable if that breaks, and shure's customer service is great. I wish all products were like this."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are perfect. Since they block out virtually all sound, I can leave my volume low to save battery life and still have tons of sound. Also good for studying if you just want to block out the sound of those around you (in a cafe or pub) without having to put in actually earplugs. For the price, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these. I've been trying to get by on cheap earbuds in my performances. The sound quality was never good. A friend put me on to these Shure earbuds. They are the best. We'll worth the money.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"wonderful soun range, very good attenuation of ambience sounds. we recommend use ambience mic to your personal monitoring mix"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as in-ear monitors on stage while playing bass. The sound is great, the low end is very clear. I'm still working on the fit, but have only been using them for about a week. Very pleased so far."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I'm slow since most people gave these headphones a favorable review but I think these headphones are awful. They're uncomfortable and the sound quality isn't that good. Maybe I didn't get it in right because they did easily come out but headphones shouldn't take more than 15min to put in. My ears were literally hurting from messing with these to fit in my ear. I tried different sized ear pieces as well since usually the small size is the one that fits best. I've tried numerous mid/high quality headphones right around this price and up and I can say with confidence that for $99 these are definitely not worth it.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awsome to be able to fo cord free on my 215 and 425 headphones. I don't have any issues like others have had with the battery and controller which I just clip to my collar with the included clip. Battery life is okay. I am getting about 6 hours. Volume is a bit lower that I would like. I often use them in noisy environments. Sound quality on my samsung S7 is about 80% what it is when corded. Much more noticeable with the 425 than the 215s. I have also been able to improve the quality by using different bt and sound engines on the S7. Compared to the other cheaper bt headphones I have tried these are substantially better, just not perfect."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Shure ear phones are the greatest sounding ear phones I have ever had. And the true sound isolation is beautiful. I even was able to listen and approve a time sensitive audio mix sent to me in a gymnasium during a basketball game. Almost total isolation. It was quite strange listening to music as the players beat on each other mercilessly. It lent a cinematic quality. Anyway I would highly recommend these. There is a bit of a learning curve to the correct placement in the ears. But once you figure that out you are set.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these earphones. I am in my private concert hall every time I plug into my Fiio player. Het the most fom your music and try this product.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good....sound isolation is awesome...they work great. For in=ears monitor...the best for the price!
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,These will not fit in everyone's ears. I would suggest trying them on before actually buying if possible.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and truly noise cancelling. I did ""break them in"" by playing them for 24 hours at my normal volume a mix of music but I cant say I noticed a huge difference in sound quality. My only issue with them is that they are currently lost and I cant use them"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, if you care for them it will last for years! however, you need to take them out every once in a while because they get a little uncomfortable resting on the bottom on the ear. despite that minor flaw i still love these headphones!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with bass response - there is none
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on these monitors is great (after breaking them in of course).

The real reason for the review is Shure's great service. One of my earbuds inexplicably went out. I cleaned them with the tool provided to no avail, so I decided to send them back to Shure. They received the earbuds on a Friday night (confirmed via email) and by Tuesday I had a replacement pair from them. Great service. Very fast. They clearly are standing by their product. Great company. Highly recommended."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, the sound is outstanding. They have just enough bass and plenty of treble. You will hear sounds in your music that you never knew were there. This is kind of spooky, especially in a quite area with no one around. They are very uncomfortable and hard to get use to. I have worn them for about 80 hours and still find it hard for them to be comfy. This is why I gave them a four star rating and not five. They come with a small, medium, and large foam buds and small, medium, and large rubber buds, so you have plenty of options to get the comfort you desire."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones with excellent sound, good bass, and wonderful isolation. Sometimes the low-end can be a little strong and distract from the highs and the mids a little, but with a little bit of EQ adjustment they sound amazing. Very durable. Easily the best earphones I've ever had."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These do what they are advertised to do. I gave them 3 stars because I have a very difficult time inserting them in my ears. Once in, they're fine. Also, the cord should be longer."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earphones for the price.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,as good as anything shure. I'm sure the better ones are better but they work great. No noise at all and fit the ear well
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. I am extremely picky about my headphones. These have fantastic sound, especially good bass for earbuds. Would definitely recommend. The style takes a little getting used to and may feel uncomfortable for a while."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use to use really cheap earphones...and someone convinced me to try Shures after my most recent earphones died on me. The sound is great...and i have a feeling i won't have to replace them for a while.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a back-up pair to my custom Ultimate Ears IEM's while those were being fixed. I am a drummer and need in-ear monitors when i'm playing live. The sound is fine, but the cheapness of the plastic moulding is the true flaw of this product.

The outer plastic is very rough and is quite painful against the ears. I suppose you could try and sand it down, but ultimately I'd pass on these cheaply crafted in-ears."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Shure earbuds for about 2 months now. I swear by them. They really have the best quality for their price. I was hesitant to purchase based on some of the other reviews and I have experienced some of the issues.

If your sound is tinny, you need to find the appropriate sized ear buds. I have rather large canals and need to use the largest foam ones to create a perfect seal. Not only does this help block out sound, but it is also required to get the full sound effect. When I tried to use the smaller silicone earbuds, They sounded tinny and had extremely low volume.

My cables have been working like a champ without any issue and they are my daily use earbuds."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds sound amazing. I use them as in ear monitors at church and they are the best earbuds I have ever used. I like how the buds are removable from the cable and the cable can be replaced.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"$100.00? Insanity for what you get. And don't get me wrong, I mean that in the best way possible. For the money, these things are awesome.

For comparison, I previously owned a pair of SE115's that I was a pretty big fan of. Those weren't quite what I was hoping for, but they were cheap. Well, I had some extra money so I started looking for a new pair of earbuds. I looked at Shure's line because I've always been a huge fan - the company makes good earbuds. Well, I looked at the SE215's and the SE315's. For the money, most people seemed more impressed with the SE215's, so that's what I went with.

They are awesome.

Get them, you won't regret it! A huge step up from the 115's."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely very durable.
Sound quality seemed best with the black foam sleeves. The foam needs to be
fitted perfectly into the ears (not too tight, not too loose) for excellent sound quality.
Found that switching the left and the right earphones helped improve the fit."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphone, good noise canceling. only complaint is how long it takes to put them on. ones you are locked in you are in a different reality though. overall a good headphone for the price and i would recommend them"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product great service but sound was lacking little bass to me
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely crisp sound. The only issue is the sound cancellation is as isolated as possible, which is what I was looking for; however, people have yelled my name right next to me and I have not been able to hear them. The behind-the-ear design takes like 5 minutes to figure out, I had to look up a video, but once you get the earbuds in snuggly, you don't forget how to do it."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good quality for a pair so cheap. I've had them for about a year or so and have had no connectivity issues that seem so common. Voices do sound a bit empty but other than that they're a solid option for the price range.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible product. The conectors between the cable and headphones are not reliable sound is constantly on and off. The wire in the interior of the cable broke off with only a couple of week of use, making it impossible to fit it around your ears.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,fast ship .. good headphones
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound very balanced the bass is good even for a single driver
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these because of other reviews I had read of them. I play drums and sing background. They sound better than the Shures' that came with my monitor system. It beats carrying around a 50 lb. wedge (that feeds back).
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broken...right ear stopped working after only a few weeks of Sunday morning Worship use.
No help from Amazon, my loss. Don't waist your $, try a different brand or company."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to say much about the sound quality--it lives up to everything the other reviews say. I purchased this as much for sleeping (I travel a lot, so I use earbuds/IE earphones as earplugs on planes and in hostels), and find that wearing these for more than two hours just isn't very comfortable, and I can't really recommend them for this purpose."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent range of sound (particularly in the bass frequencies) and I can hear absolutely nothing else outside once the music stars playing. Great for working out in a gym if you wish to drown out the crap they might be playing there with your selection of music.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For what I paid for them I expected a much fuller sound. These sound tinny. I think you must have a music player that has a built in equalizer to get them to a more fuller, rich sound."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good quality
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these buds for my wife. She is by no means an audiophile but even she can appreciate the quality that Shure provides. Her favorite thing about these buds is the sounds isolation provided by the various tips.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these when I play drums live. After two months of use, the right side started to give disconnect sound when I move sometimes. Not a big deal yet , but it's not as sturdy as I thought. And I keep it/use it very carefully, and don't even move that much."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Those are some sweet headphones. Wore them almost 12 hours straight on my flight from Las Vegas to Frankfurt. They fit perfectly. And you hear almost nothing of your surroundings anymore.
Changing the actual ear pieces seems a bit tricky though.
They meet all my expectations though!!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good. But you have to pick the flexible bud that fits your ear to get the best effect. The bass is good as the highs. The complaints I read about adapting the buds around the ear is not as bad as mentioned. I fly a lot and have to place them on my ears often. After the third adjustment I know exactly how to use them without difficulty. Its really simple. The cord is a little long but better long than short. I like the cord. Of five different buds I own these are the best.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these to replace an earlier model of Shure Earphones (that are discontinued). I am pleased with them. Like I mentioned I got them to replace a pair of Shure earphones that I lost, I think that they sound great and are comfortable to wear. My wife also has a pair."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Good sound and a good fit.
Takes a little getting use to placing them in the ear.
The cord is heavy duty and a little unconfortable to wear.
Love the Clear look they do not fall off when exercising."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, perfect fit and fits flat against my ear. I have used them for 100's or hours biking as they cut wind noise and replace it with tunes. Would buy again if I lost them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215-K are really good and strong earbuds. I had the Sony MDR-XB90EX and I broke them accidently as I snapped the connector when my lamp fell and took my phone which was charging with the cable. From Japan so no warranty. The Sony's are very strong and were my ""beater buds"" (durable headphones for everyday use). I looked for another durable set and the RHA MA750i, T20i and Shure SE215 were on my list. I bought it cause of the detachable cable. Better audio than that of the vSonic VSD5 I had previously. The Shure has wide soundstage, low bass can be heard and not too overpowering, it felt like a huge jump in audio quality and performance from the Sony ""Bass XB90EZ"". The cable has problems and that's why I've given it 3/5 stars. Look at the previous comment on June 8 by H. Yasli, I'm experiencing the same issue, the audio breaks on either the left and right on occasions when moving and you have to tilt or move your head to get audio fixed. Would have given it a 5/5 for the price point. Sometimes, it's fine and works with no breaking in audio, but then a small head movement and the audio breaks. Luckily, it's a detachable cable so I'm going to order a new detachable cable which is not from Shure with an inline remote control for iOS (pause, play, volume controls) and it's a great decision I didn't buy the ios version of the Shure SE215 model with their inline remote for extra $50,"

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound ..great stereo separation .. good bass high treble...cant do better for 100$$
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are, quite simply, an outstanding pair of earbuds and a tremendous value.

The key to getting great sound from them is inserting them correctly -- READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! You can easily insert them incorrectly; if you do, they WILL sound bad. I think that many (most?) of the negative reviews must have been written by buyers who weren't using them correctly. The biggest difference between the SE215 and, say, the SE200 (which I previously owned) is the quality of the seal and sound isolation. The SE200 fits like a pair of earplugs (the kind you'd wear to sleep); the SE215 fits like a pair hearing aids, held securely in the ear canal AND in contour of your ears. With the cables looped over your ears, there is absolutely no reason why these should fall out.

What really matters is sound quality and in this area, the Shure 215 shines. Bass is full without being overpowering, mids & highs are clear & crisp. I literally heard qualities in my music that I never heard before. I recommended them to a musician friend who was initially skeptical that they could be as good as I claimed. We rarely talk on the phone but he called me just to tell me how stoked he was about these earbuds."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, I've changed the cable a couple of times, but I use these things on an almost daily basis. I used them in my commute, for running, at work for music and to video conference (I bought a cable with a mic a while ago), and with my PS4. These things are solid!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The shure are an ok earphones, first the cable is freaking long almost looks like u can use it as a jumprope, second putting the earpiece at first it looks annoying get ready to spend like 5 minutes trying to figured it out how to wear it and last the Earbuds hard to change and uncomfortable to use."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone's plastic body really hurts my outer ears after about 60 minutes of use. I tried using the different ear tips in the hopes of changing the geometry/fit against my outer ears, but it didn't help."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love my earphones! Only complaint is that the included earbuds are crap. If you get these then also purchase a separate set of Shure sleeves made specifically for this model.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These isolate the s*** out of sound, I can barely hear anything when they're in. And the sound quality is just preposterously good. The cord is super duper long too so they're great for the gym. Biggest complaint is that they just look nerdy as s***."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is excellent, and the sound isolation is awesome. even without the foam tips, just using the normal silicone tips isolated enough noise that I would feel comfortable drumming with. Great!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These feel like high quality and extremely durable headphones. I usually only use buds, but these mold to the ear comfortably. The sound quality is excellent. My one complaint is, I wish they were a bit louder. Headphones usually only last me about a month so we will have to see how these hold up and if the extra price was worth it. Updates to come."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headphones to use as In Ear Personal Monitoring System at the church. I play drums and the noise canceling is great, the sound is flat (sometimes too flat for my taste but is not a bad thing) but has great preasure. It takes some time to know how to fit them properly in your ears, but once you learn you understand why they are constructed that way. They realy worth every cent. It's shure, no more words needed."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Items just as described, shipping was nice and fast as well!! They can get some getting use to, but once you find the best fit they are worlds ahead of the competition out there."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. It does take a little while to break them in. But he sound is amazing.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,super great
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have invested nearly $4000 in ear buds over the last 10 years from companies such as Klipsch, UE, Shure, and others. I use these units all day at work as well as at night to fall asleep and I love them. They fit my ears well with the foam inserts, and all of the hardware holds up fairly well."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've paid more for earbuds that have not performed as well as these Shure earbuds. The earbuds are comfortable once the proper fit is established with the various sizes supplied. Quality of the cables and the buds are heavy duty and durable.

Have already used the buds for air travel on some longer flights noting exceptional cancelling of outside noise and excellent comfort."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. They do an amazing job of isolating and cutting out the background noise. I also like that they fit comfortably and stay put when I run.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Build and finish is great. Sound isolation is the best I've experienced. I couldn't even hear people talking around me. Bass is good and overall its a great listening experience. The only things I don't like is that they don't feel very comfortable, although I wonder if this is something that will mitigate over time. Also, they are a pain to put on properly. Other than that though, no complaints. I suggest that if you get a chance, you should try them on first and judge the fit and comfort for yourself before buying them."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset but wears on ears is a bit weird. Fit almost like a hearing aid. sound is amazing. Once get used to the fit, they will be the favorite pair. Well worth the 100 bucks"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I originally bought the Dr. Dre Powerbeats and returned them immediately. After reading several reviews I decided to buy the Shure SE215. I just used them for a 75 minute session on the stationary bike. I could not hear any noise at all from any of the pieces of equipment min use around me so the noise isolation is outstanding. Being an audiophile I found the the sound very well balanced with very good bass extension. They were not affected by moisture at all and stayed firmly in my ears for the entire session. I extremely impressed.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong solid cable. Great for in a gym due to being more durable than normal ear buds. Excellent sound and very comfortable. The piece that goes around your ear can actually be bent to whatever shape you need it, then it holds it shape so they stay on snug. Plenty of foam and rubber ear pieces came with it. Overall a good buy."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but too difficult to place in the ear, which is critical to the sound quality, especially the low end. I found myself having
to use a mirror just to see how to insert the buds properly, and the cable is a bit too cumbersome around the ears."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good fit and very comfortable for long wear. The sound quality is neutral and compared to my earphones that came with my Galaxy note of years ago is noticeable on another level.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find it ironic that the first ear buds by Shure to have replaceable wires also have the most reinforced wires. These sound great to me, and you can get all of the technical details from the other reviewers.

I have owned the E2Cs and SE210s, and these are my favorites out of the batch."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I made a decision to purchase these Shure SE215 headphones based on all the positive reviews here.

The issues I have experienced are:

I can't get a proper fit with the foam buds - I can get them on in such a manner that the sound is good, but if I turn my head one, or both may fall out.

Sound quality, especially bass,is very diminished if not worn perfectly.

Sound quality - These are definitely studio monitor headphones. Different audio sources and recordings sound as perfect or imperfect as they were engineered. Not a bad thing, but I'd rather just enjoy the music and not think, wow that sound guy must have been half deaf when he mixed that.

Bass - I found the opposite of some reviewers. I thought bass was a little light, even slightly de-emphasized.

I spent half my flight the other day fiddling around with these buds. People behind me probably thought I had lice or something.

I much prefer the overall sound and ease of use of my $8 Sony EX10 buds than these. Just ordered another pair."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply to explain; Perfect.
amazing bass and sound details,
its name is correct; really a live sound monitor.
It will satisfy all your expectation from a headphone below 200$.
good sound isolation
very good material quality and details.
but I suggested you to listen music with it when you are not jogging / running."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these 2 months ago and they have already broken

i was satisfied with the quality and comfort, but unfortunately, one earbud is already broken.

Is there any recourse or warranty for these when purchased from Amazon?"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best.
Tried. 8 different buds sent them all back.
These things are fantastic.
Sound is amazing."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have plenty of volume and the sound is much better than previous earbuds I have used. Of course this comparison is of earbuds in the $20 range. If your not an audiophile, don't spend the extra money. They will need to last a long time for me to consider them a good value."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these earphones for about a year now and can say that they will last a very long time if you use the included carrying case (which is nice). The sound isolation on these are very good, and the sound is very clear. However, if you are used to and love bass heavy headphones I would not recommend these as they do not produce the lower frequencies with as much power."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting. Initial response: never had in ear monitors before, getting used to putting them in your ears is kind of tricky, only have done it 3 or 4 times so far, and I always end up getting them backwards or something. BUt they feel good and feel like they will stick in your ears and not pull out like some ear buds. i could see jogging in these. Little disappointed in the cord length..feels like 3'...i thought they were a little longer. but then I could see people complaining about long cords too. Its a decent size, i just like the length of recording headphones - so you can move around. i use them at work so would be nice to plug in the computer and be able to walk around a little. But nice length if have a device on your person. They sound great. been listening to daft punk - decent bass - wasn't looking for a super bass earbud, sounds kind of gimmicky (beatz!!!!) i like true sound - and monitors i suppose help achieve this? In ear monitors may be the ticket! my ears feel cool! not the case with my studio AKG's at home. They tend to get a litle warm. Got to get used to the style - over the ear thing and people might look at you weird, but they feel good, sound great. I like them. Wasn't sure what to buy and for the price, meh. Wanted the other cord with mic and volume control for android, but saw poor reviews. and i don't know if i'd use the mic/volume as much as I think i would. but would be a nice option. I like these because the cord can disconnect from the phones. always a good feature if something happened to the cord or vice versa.

Cons: connie (the name)"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow... it is a excellent in-ear earphone with respect to the price. Sound quality is very high. Specially BASS and TREBLES are great!

Another thing, the background noise sounds are almost blocked by the earphone body! It is great look and the connection code is very long! The only problem is There is no Volume Control with this. It should be additionally purchase.

I have already written a book about the ""Everything About Earphones"" and I studied almost 100 earphones for that with various brands the cost below US $ 300 earphones. This is one of the best earphone that I studied so far, others are BOSE QC 20i, Yamaha EPH100, ... .

Anyway I strongly recommended this to others!

I am planning to buy a High End Shure Earphone (That is Either Shure SE - 535 or Shure SE - 846), because It has a 3 or 4 drivers with balanced armature technique! The price of Shure SE - 535 is not so bad, but Shure SE - 846 is very very expensive than 3 drivers one!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first purchased these headphones the left side blew out within a couple weeks but I was able to exchange them for a new pair. I should've asked for a refund. The new pair lasted just long enough that the return window would expire and leave me stuck with a useless pair of 100 dollar headphones. The sound quality and noise cancellation is great when it works but don't waste your time. If you're going to spend a little more on headphones, invest in something that'll last. Don't make the same mistake as me."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Through a couple of Apple iPhones, a Samsung Android phone, an iPad and Nexus 7 tablet I've kept searching for the perfect in-ear monitors with an integrated microphone. The earbuds shipped with the devices fell out of my ears in seconds. And the inexpensive replacements I tried sounded so bad I dropped them in the garbage.

I finally got a pair of V-Moda's to fit and sound decent. But the microphone was just okay for phone calls. Then, after a while, one side started losing low end. A couple of weeks later the volume of that side was about half of the good side.

I tried the Bowers & Wilkins C5's and they sounded pretty good but they never were comfortable for an extended time. The worst thing was they kept turning the volume down on my Android phone at random times. Every now and then some head movement would trigger the mute button. I couldn't just relax and enjoy the music.

Then I realized that I'd made a classic mistake. I'd tried to get a tool to do more than one job well and was disappointed when it did not happen.

I'm a media producer with over 35 years experience in audio and video production. I use headphones and in-ear systems for monitoring audio during video production, checking mixes in post-production, monitoring audio during online calls, and listening for pleasure on weekends.

I dropped the idea of using my in-ear monitors for anything other than listening. I kept reading about the Shure SE215's and decided to give them a try.

Out of the box they had a pleasing, balanced sound. In fact, they sounded better brand new than some units I'd burned in for hours. And they not only fit my ears, they stayed where I put them.

They become almost invisible after a couple of minutes. I'm talking about the audio field disappearing as well as the physical fit. The music just happens and it's so silky smooth it makes me smile.

Yes, you will need to try different sleeves to find what fits you. And the sleeves are difficult to remove at first.

Yes, you might want to find a youtube video showing you how to put them on correctly. It makes a huge difference when they are seated properly with the cables over your ears.

Yes, they block almost all the sound in the room. That's what they are designed to do. That's why musicians on stage like to wear them. I need that, too, when I use them in a production environment.

Just make sure you get the left and right monitors in the correct ears. I switched them once by accident and couldn't believe how much difference it made when I had them on the correct sides.

If you're like me and want a pair of comfortable, affordable, accurate in-ear monitors that just sound great then I highly recommend the SE215's. I paid $99 for them here on Amazon and they are one of the best audio purchases I've made in a long time."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure headphone fan for a long time. I love the quality, sound, range, etc.
But the world is moving on and my iPhone lost its headphone plug...the adaptor is a pain, depression that I could not easily use my beloved Shure SE 525's set in...BANG!! Shure delivered the best adaptor out there, simply detach the earphone from the original cord, plug in the BT-1 cable in, connect via Bluetooth and WHAM!! you have a wireless SHURE EARPHONE...great product design.
Shure, thank you for providing a pathway to wireless, once again you have made me a customer for life."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone are pretty good. Some pros and cons. First off, the wire is really long. For some people this could be a plus or a minus. The wire is incredibly durable and I like the protection at the end of the plug. Its is a little big and bulky, but it still fits into my otter box defender series case for iPhone 6. Next, the ear buds. They seem really durable as well. They fit into my ears perfectly. They took maybe a day for me to get used to putting them into my ears. They are flush with the ear so you can lay on your side and still be perfectly comfortable. After a few seconds of having these in my ears, I barley notice that they are there. I love the memory phone ear tips. They are amazing at canceling out outside noise. I can't hear anything when they are in. The sound is relatively good. They sound no better than my stock apple headphones that came with my iPhone. I was expecting better sound quality from $99 headphones. All that being said, I am still very happy with my purchase and would recommend to a friend."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for about 3 months now. I purchased them to use while I lift at the gym aboard my ship. These appealed to me because of the over-the-ear design to keep them from slipping out of my ears like my previous headphones, and because of the noise isolation. The gym on my ship also houses the A/C compressors for the accommodation which are incredibly loud.

Pros:

These headphones have excellent isolation and feel pretty comfortable when you find the right size foam for your ear. I have slightly different ear canal sizes so I had to use two different ones.

The sound quality is pretty decent although, as some have noted, it may be a little bass heavy for some. Messing with the equalizer on your media player should help that.

Cons:

The cord is very thick and heavy which I thought would be a good thing but ended up making them a little cumbersome. Along with the thickness, the cord is also about 8 inches longer than any other headphone cord I have dealt with which makes keeping the cord from getting caught on things is difficult.

As many other have experienced, one side of the detachable cord went out and only works when the cable is manually held in a certain position. It is probably pretty easy to see how this can be a problem. This happened after the second week of light, one hour a day use. Because I work on a ship, I didn't really have a chance to return them before my Amazon return period ended so now I am forced to go through the warranty return process. I have heard some bad things about Shure's customer service.

Conclusion:

Overall, if it was not for the failure of the cord and having to go through the warranty process to get it fixed, I would recommend these headphones. However, since so many people have encountered this problem (some more than once), I would say to look elsewhere for some headphones. I am fully expecting to have to do a warranty return on these multiple times and really wish I could have returned them during the warranty period.

Update: I contacted Shure after my headphones failed and they sent me another pair that have been working for the last two years. These ones don't seem to suffer from the same problem so I have updated my star rating."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is an trusted audio company that produces fantastic products, and offers a 2 year limited warranty on their in-ears. The SE215's are a great option for the $100 price point. Since they block out so much noise, they are great for commuting, working in noisy areas, or for on-stage performance.

PROS
- Great sound. Can't stress that enough.
- Great noise isolation. Comes with 3 foam and 3 rubber earbuds (in S, M, and L sizes of each type). These earbuds block out up to 37 decibels of sound, with the foam being more effective. Because they isolate so well, I do not (and would not recommend) wearing these while exercising or in any circumstance where you need to hear what is going on around you.
- Solid cable construction. The cable is sturdier near the ear (so it doesn't break from wrapping the wire behind the ear). The cable is also detachable at the earpiece so you can replace a cable/earpiece cheaper.
- They stay once you get them on. I have had trouble with in-ear headphones staying in my ear for long periods of time, but these fit well and stay put. Wrapping the cord behind your ear helps a lot with this.

CONS
- Changing the earbuds. I had a lot of trouble getting the Medium foam earbuds off initially. I would recommend using you fingernail to slowly and carefully slide off the earpiece. Removing the foam earbuds is more difficult than the rubber ones.
- Achy ear canals. After wearing the buds for an hour or so my ear begins to ache a bit. They fit snugly in the ear, which is what blocks out so much of the noise around you. A bit of aching is a price I am willing to pay though.

FINAL THOUGHTS
These in-ear earbuds are the best I have ever used. I ended up changing to the rubber small earpieces and love the fit. Some people recommend a burn-in period of 20+ hours before these work to their true potential, but I have not noticed any difference after many hours of listening."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have another pair of shure headphones thats more than six years old and also happen to cost more than double what i paid for the 215, i was worried these would be noticably inferior to my other Shures, i have to be honest i'm very impressed, the bass is amazing, your not going to beleive me till you actually try these on, most people see these tiny headphones and automatically assume theres probably no bass

I had custom ear peices made from a third party, i recommend anyone who uses these during workouts to do the same, i tend to sweat a lot during workouts and the original ear peices always fall out

i actually look forward to going to the gym just so i can put these on,

Btw i bought the clear ones, they look awesome :-)"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Performs nearly as well as my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. Keep in mind, those are made for professional studio monitoring. They never leave my desk. These, on the other hand are just perfect for travel, running, working out or anything else. The bass comes in clear as day, exactly what I wanted. The sound is warm and creamy and I get no distortion when I run them through my DAC or phone. I was skeptical about how they fit into my ear at first. When they came and I tried them on for the first time, my worries quickly went away. You forget that you're even wearing earbuds because they just make them float in your ears. This style allows you to lay on a pillow comfortably and watch Netflix on your phone into the wee hours of the morning. Before, I couldn't leave home with my Sony's or my Grado Labs SR80e's, due to the size and the Grado headphones being open-back. These have almost no leakage according to my brother who sits right next to me while using the computer. They do not fall out of your ears, which is a blessing. If any sound is coming out of them, they isolate everything perfectly (I have yet to take them on an airplane, so maybe they don't block everything, we will see). The releasable cable is a fantastic addition to these beauties. Although the cable is extremely tough, eventually every pair of earbuds I have owned in the past have had their fair share of wear and tear. If these ever suffer a break or tear, Replacing them should be effortless and inexpensive!

Overall, they are by far the best earbuds I have put in my ears, and I am picky when it comes to my sound. My family members swear by BOSE, and I just laugh when I put their headphones in. The sound quality on these is infinitely better and look way cooler! I might even take these in to see if I can get a custom mold one day, we'll see!"

The pros for this is the price. For $100 you got a Shure product, I think that is pretty fair for the quality."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything that everyone says about it is correct. Using them is so cattywonkus and a pain in the ass if you have glasses.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just began using these and purchased them chiefly because I wanted to use them in my motorcycle helmet. They fit closer to my head than either the MEE or the HF5 earbuds I own.
I purchased the MEE for this reason, but they are not as closely fitting to my head as I had hoped. So, I took a chance on the 215s and am glad I did. These are recessed a bit from the outer edge of my ear, the best I could hope for.
I was very pleased with the sound of these buds. They sound better than the other two above and I can't quite describe why: they seem to be amplified? I tried all three at the same volume on my iphone 5s and these were louder, but also fuller sounding.
If I knew what I do now, I would only have purchased these buds.
I have owned the HF5s for several years, I am actually on my second set which has lasted for 4 years or so. They are constructed with thinner, tackier wires that do not detach. I paid around $100 for them.
The MEEs cost $179 and are constructed very sturdily with detachable wires...but the buds are heavy and they protrude too far, but they do fit in my motorcycle helmet better than the HF5s. They do not sound as pleasing to me as the 215s.
If these 215s hold up under normal usage as well as the HF5s, and from appearances I would guess that they should do better, then I will be pleased with this purchase.
3-17-18: I have had some difficulty putting the ear buds in my ears. They are not as easy as the MEE ear buds, U think it is because of the reinforced wire near the buds."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product arived right on time before the weekend. I enjoy the headphone a great deal. The sound is clear and natural but not imposing. Need a little get-use-to to put them on. The are more comfortable than the pair I owned for 5 years until recently. A little bigger than the old pairs (the 3-level). Sound isolation works as expected. A lot less wire noise than my old pair. The low is not as significant as expected and described by other users. After all it is a 2-level.

That being said, I was looking for a quality set of in-ear buds that would be: immersive in its sound range, fun with a significant amount of bass, and durable in its build quality. Iphone functionality would be a big plus as well. My budget was around $100-125.

I purchased the Sennheiser CX series earbuds, which were obnoxiously bright and yellow. I got a great deal from a friend, so decided to try them. I also purchased the Shure S115i, and the Klipsch S4i, with the full intentions of settling on one and returning the rest to Apple. The Sennheisers were pretty mediocre all around, and I use them when I know I'll be beating them up on a long run. I loved the warm tones of the 115s, but they lacked the oomph in the low end I was really looking for. The S4i I have to say, was the most fun out of all three. The bass is killer, and I actually find the oval tips rather comfortable. However, the build quality is absolutely shocking, and ended up being a dealbreaker for me. I returned all of them and decided I'd continue my search. I stumbled across the 215s on here and decided to check them out after seeing so many positive reviews.

The build is fantastic. The cable isn't kevlar, but seems to be a thick rubber, and is fully replaceable. I love the design of the buds, and after a little molding of the behind-ear cabling, it fits and feels great. I truly love the foam tips, and the flat design is easy to lay on if you are in bed listening to them.

Sound quality is what I expected, and was pleasantly surprised with the bass response. Mids and highs come in crisp and clean, and the bass kicks without being boomy. You are not going to get the earth-rattling bass of the S4 but it definitely holds its own, and is very defined and tight. My collection of music ranges from bass-heavy dubstep to acoustic rock, and it plays every track clean and accurately. I almost wish it had just a touch more kick-in-the-pants bass boom to it, but I wouldnt sacrifice the clean and tightness that you get here for it.

All in all though, I stand behind this as my favorite of the bunch. I don't have the sophisticated ears of an audiophile, but I enjoy losing myself in every subtle note when I listen to music. I really found what I was looking for in these, and recommend them for anyone looking for Shure quality and build with the added bass thats missing from the 115s."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first pair of Shure earbuds over 5 years ago. I use them for listening to music in the gym and while studying. They've consistently delivered excellent sound quality and durability, When I began to think about going wireless in the gym, I was thrilled to learn that I could buy a detachable BT cable rather than buying an entirely new set of earbuds. The cable arrived in good condition and worked wonderfully for the first few weeks of use. My only complaint would be the bulky control module that bounced against my chest while running, even with the battery pack clipped to my clothing. While I wasn't using the earbuds and BT cable, I stored them in a carrying case in my gym bag, as I had with the wired version. Upon bringing them inside from near-freezing temperatures, the cable stopped working completely. No LED indicator, voice prompts, or music at all. I initially blamed myself for storing them inappropriately, but after reading other reviews, it seems that the cable won't even stand up to sweat from regular gym use. I would expect that a product marketed for use in the gym/running would be able to withstand temperature and moisture challenges. I had high hopes given Shure's usually excellent products, but unfortunately I will be looking elsewhere for BT earbuds."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones have amazing quality of sound for what they are. They lack a bit in the bass range of course, but all the sounds they produce are clear and crisp.

On the downside, none of the sleeves they came with were comfortable for me. I picked up some Shure EAYLF1-10 Foam Sleeves to go with them, and that solved that problem."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good, but it's very uncomfortable for the first few days. It gets better by time and when you find the best fit for you. But it's still not as comfortable as Bose for example."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great for listening to music while mowing grass with an exceedingly loud mower. Blocks out a lot of ambient noise.
I can clearly hear a the clic track from my phone while practicing with my acoustic drum kit.
Definatly worth the money!!!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great until the break and the warranty is only a year . Not worth the pain
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"From the reviews I read and the price I paid I was expecting this pair of earphones to last at least a year, but they lasted about 9 months. Although the sound quality was excellent, I will likely seek out a more durable pair in the future."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these a while ago and I thought they would be good since I purchased a pair by SHURE before. However, I have only used these three times and the left ear bud stopped working. Needless to say I am really disappointed as I like the brand."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. Sturdy and solid. Excellent sound quality.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sure is a lot more, and it takes getting use to because of the design and wrap around the ear wiring, but the sound quality is fantastic.
If money is no object get the Shure."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect sound, and lightweight fit.
My only complaint is that there's no mic, and it's over $60 to get a cable with mic...."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These things can take a beating. I wear them every day at work in a metal shop. They sound ok next to my old triple fi 10s but were 4 times the price. Up against a pair of skull candy's the shure's are amazing and a real work horse. Super comfortable.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After researching forever I went with Shure. The Bose I had heard and not to impressed with, so I thought I would try these. The lows, mids and highs were great for my listening habits. Also being able to remove the cables and replace them are great. Try them. They are great."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SHURE. Like the first one, the right ear piece is not working very well now. Didn’t purchase any warranty when buying this pair. Don’t know if I can get it fixed?"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these earphones for almost 2 years now and hardly a day goes by where I don't use them. I've used them everywhere: on the plane, on the bus, in the car, on the subway, while walking to classes, and so on. The sound isolation on these earphones is excellent and ensures they can be used in pretty much any setting. Cable noise (microphonics) also isn't an issue.

I'm not going to comment on the sound signature because 1) I find from my ventures on head-fi that it just leads to increasingly pretentious and empty-sounding adjectives (cold, analytical, warm, fun, juicy...), 2) I use these IEMs frequently in noisy environments (which is the whole point of getting an IEM right? if I didn't need the isolation i'd just walk around with my headphones) and 3) I believe that it's the job of the artist, not the headphone, to make the music sound good (I listen to classical music). For me the ideal earphone would be an exact replicate of what one hears in real life (I think audiophiles would call this ""neutral""). What I will say is that I also own a pair of Shure SRH840 full-size headphones, and that music from my headphones and IEMs sound pretty much the same except of course with a smaller soundstage on the IEMs. In other words, I've never had any complaints about the sound quality of these earphones, and I think they offer at least excellent value, maybe even the best, for their price.

My one complaint is that after owning these earphones for about 2 years, sometimes the music doesn't come out properly from the left earbud and one has to give the cable a twist or two to get it to work. I've owned my Shure SRH840 headphones for 3 years and they have a similar problem, the music doesn't come out properly focused sometimes and one has to adjust the plug until it does. So I think this might be a cable problem with Shure products in general and I'd be curious to know if others have had this problem.

In short these earphones offer excellent sound quality and isolation, but after a few years you may find that they don't work as perfectly as hoped, which is a little disappointing considering they do cost a nontrivial amount of money. If I were to buy a new pair of IEMs today, I'd take a really good look around and see if I can't do better than the Shure SE215, but even if you can't, it's not the end of the world by any means."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,works great
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:

- Great fit
- Terrific sound
- Nice clarity
- Extremely effective noise cancellation

Cons:

- Somewhat inconvenient to put on & take off
- Sound isn't as balanced as I'd like, leans towards bass
- Extremely effective noise cancellation"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have mentioned, it's a little awkward putting them in but after a few times, it's no big deal. I like the flat, against you ear contour. They're comfortable to listen to while laying down. I think they sound great which is the most important feature."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not comfortable to wear, very complicated. I had to return it and go buy another kind at the store."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too big to fit comfortably. They block outside noise very well, but stretch the ear shell. They might be great for people with larger ears, but for me, they hurt."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can wear the earbuds forever. Sit great in my ear. The multiple sleeve options make sure I get a good fit. Great sound.

I keep looking at earbuds that cost ~$200 more and hten come back to this one because I can't justify the added expense."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Straight out of the box I am already encountering problems with the cord connection with the ear piece. If I move it a certain way the sound cuts out. This is probably a problem with the contact between the cord and the earpiece. Other than this one problem I am already experiencing, everything else is great about these earphones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Given I already own other ""higher ticket"" Sure (SE 315, SE 425, and SE 535) and Westone UM2 and 3, as well as about 4 other pairs of high quality earphones ( although all were before replaceable cables), I am absolutely blown away by the overall quality and value of these earphones so far. The convenience and simplicity of Westone cables is the best I have ever used but the overall sound quality and extremely reasonable cost of the Sure SE215 earphones have already become my absolute favorites.
These definitely take a bit of cable manipulation to optimize comfort per individual but the overall sound is terrific. The mids and highs are sharp and bass not sacrificed. I actually think Westone has not adequately adressed the mid/highs which is important to me.
I look forward to giving an update in a month or two but so far I would recommend these earphones over almost anything I own that cost more!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After over a month of use, I am happy to report how much I like these headphones. Comfortable for hours of use. Good sound isolation without blocking out too much of your surroundings. Great accurate bass that avoids overpowering the midrange and highs. Highly recommend!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the sound quality I expected. For the price I would have expected something better than standard Apple earbuds, but unfortunately these don't provide that. Also the wrap around ear design takes a while to get used to. Not the best but not the worst"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"great once you get the right tips for your ears, but the contact has issues. the music cutting out when you tilt your head a certain way sucks (irritates me on the treadmill). Great sound quality for the price though."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband snores SO loud & these ear buds totally block him out. I also like my bass & I got it now!! Shoulda bought these a long time ago had I known about them! Worth every penny!
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones to use for IEMs
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds were exactly what I was looking for. Good, comfortable, sound suppressing earbuds at a reasonable price. Sound quality is great! I used these on an airplane and watched a movie. Sound was crystal clear and blocked out unwanted noise."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty great.Good solid bass and a nice clean sound to them. I was worried about the bass being overly prominent but actually found it perfect to my taste. Using them for long hours though did seem to make the seal not work so well.
Accidentally broke one of the standard ear bud foam pieces, instructions were unclear."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first impression is that the headphones are great. They have a great mix between lows, mids, and highs. The box they are packaged in is nice and sturdy, but easy to get into.

They are without a doubt the best noise isolating headphones I've ever owned. I couldn't hear a thing while listening to my music. I plan on using these as a monitor for playing live drums, and I think they are going to work great for that."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase and price for a quality set of earphones. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and depth. I am looking forward to purchase the higher model of this Shure.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because of the positive ratings I had seen online. Although the sound is as advertized, the cord is awful. I am getting ready to return for service for the second time in less then 2 years of use, and much of the time, they have sat unused because of the defective cable. The first time, the wiring broke loose at the connection to the earpiece. This time, the wire broke inside as I have no sound on the right side at all. This is unacceptable!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to mostly rock, metal, blues etc and these are perfect. Once I found the right nubs that fit my ear"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace my dual driver Ultimate Ears which broke and these are not nearly as good. They are pretty good for the price, but I would save up for a dual or triple driver earbuds."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones have amazing sound. Much better than the $300 Bose earphones. The one design issue is that they have an abnormal design where the wire goes over your ear and around the back. This is via a more rigid conforming wire and can be preferred by some and not by others.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for about a month now. I use them daily at work, and I have to say, I LOVE them. The sound quality is amazing. Like others have said, I hear things in my music now that I did not before. Of course, I was coming from the cheap Samsung ear buds that game with my Galaxy S III, but I don't think this invalidates my point.

As far as fit, once you get the hang of putting them in (there is a learning curve if you're coming from standard buds), you can pop them in and out with no problem and when they're in, they're IN. They don't move around at all and the rigid part of the cord helps as it serves as an ear hook of sorts.

I do have to agree with the previous reviewer on my ears getting tired out. Because these block out a lot of ambient noise (they might as well be noise-cancelling - people have had ""conversations"" with me that I have not heard while listening through these), your ears do get tired out after a while. I LOVE music and I LOVE listening to it for hours on end; but I definitely do feel some level of relief when I pull them out of my ears after long listening sessions. They have been great for my needs though - they block out most, if not all of the noise around me (namely, my co-workers' conversations) so that I can focus on my work.

I'm also a musician, and I'm hoping to get to try these out in a live sound application at some point; I just haven't played anywhere that has an in-ear monitor system.

So here's the breakdown:

PROS:

Clear, balanced sound
Build Quality
Nice zippered case with a big ""Shure"" label so people know you mean business when it comes to your music listening.

CONS:
Learning curve with learning how to put them in (It's a short one).
Tired ears after extended use.

I'd ABSOLUTELY buy these again, but I guess time will tell how they hold up."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first product I've felt the need to write a review about so here goes:

I have a lot of headphones..
Panasonic in ear
Beats by dre in ear
The new Polk nue voe in ears(consumers choice)
Monster Jamz in ear
AKG over ear semi open
Klipshe over ear closed

And these.

The Shure SE215s are my favorite by far. They aren't the easiest to put on. They aren't the most convenient either. What they offer is pure performance. Sex for the ears. The first time I got these to fit and turned them up, I got almost teary-eyed. Chills. I clearly had been missing something.

$100. They out perform all 6 of my other headphones. All of which are valued above $100. Extremely impressive noise canceling. You've probably read other reviews say the same. DONT buy these for riding your bike/motorcycle etc on public roads. You will not hear anything but music. I'm not sure if you'd even hear a car horn to be honest. So take it on the plane, to the gym, at home, at work or wherever else you don't need to hear anything else.
The clarity is outstanding. Precise highs and rich, accurate lows. Mids aren't the best of my bunch, but I'd say they're pretty good overall. The cord i believe is made of Kevlar. It doesn't behave like other cords you've had. That coupled with the 'around the ear' design keep it from getting in the way at the gym or flailing around while running. It will also never tangle. Never. It's not so great because you can't crumple them up into a ball like I know some of you do when you put them away. I've lost a few headphones to the cord breaking, so I know why they reinforced these so much. I welcome their heavy dutiness, but that's not to say you'll find them as convenient. I don't know why there's no volume control. It doesn't bother me too much, because I have to take them off to talk to someone anyways.(again, you won't hear much with them on). The overall max volume of these are on the good side compared to other $200 sets. I've heard a tiny bit of over modulation but only at max volume which I never need to use. I've also noticed the sound can cut out if the jack isn't seated properly. This is rare, but annoying.

Overall, well, I've told friends that this is my favorite worldly possession. I guess that should tell you something too. $100 is a steal for this kind of audio."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy, stays in place, sounds great, sound isolation is amazing. Buying a pair for my lady. ok update mine went out after a couple of weeks. rt side kept cutting out, think its a short in the wire. very irritating. time to see what sue service is like"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second set that I have owned. The last set lasted at least three years but finally needed to be retired. The sound quality is unbelievable on these and the noise cancellation is more than adequate to filter out most of the background and let you enjoy quality sound at a much lower volume. Definitely recommend these.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To all the drummers...If you're looking for an inexpensive way to have in ear monitors for purposes of playing to a click (and also for vocal monitoring purposes) these buds are great. When inserted correctly, Isolation is comparable to the roll up foam 32db ear plugs I have been using live for many years to protect my hearing in a VERY LOUD stage volume band. These buds have excellent isolation and make playing to a click live very easy."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching and searching and searching for a headphone that will NOT fall out when I'm running and sweating. I have had this headphone for about one year and a few months and they no longer stay in my ears. When I first got them, they seemed to work at staying in, but now the wire that goes over the top of the ear is worn out and I'm constantly fidgeting with them to keep them in my ears even after changing the buds. I cannot even use them for just sitting around. Great sound if you are NOT using them for serious exercise where you will sweat a lot. The cord is also heavy and awkward to put on. Overall these are NOT worth the $100 price tag for an exercising headphone that you will have to dispose of in one year. I am online now because I am AGAIN searching for new headphones that will STAY IN MY FREAKING EARS WHEN I RUN AND SWEAT!! ANY SUGGESTIONS?"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves them....just disappointed in the late delivery as they were his birthday present!

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not really what i expected, for 100 dollars i expected quality sound. Unfortunately i only got mediocre sound.

This is my 3rd set of professional in-ear monitors. I have previously owned a set of Customer molded LiveWires and Westone UM-2's with detachable molds. To be completely honest, the sound quality, clarity, fit, and finish of the Shure SE215's are AS GOOD, if not BETTER THAN both sets of custom buds I had in the past. I highly recommend these to any professional musician, or music enthusiast looking for a very reliable set of in-ears."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is my second pair of these headphones. they are the best in-eat I've ever used. they have great sound isolation.

The bass is definitely there, but it's not overpowering like I'm used to with my subwoofers at home, but I can't really expect too much bass from earphones in this price range. Also, the headphones are very comfortable, secure, and sturdy. Looks pretty cool too."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this earphone. Isolation is very good and the sound is great. A good bonus is that the cable is quite sturdy compared to other in-ear headphones. I've been using it for over a years and the cable has no signs of tears.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Good quality for a basic set of In-Ears. Love that you can replace just the cable if needed.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible sound isolation! The only thing is that I was listing to music when my house caught on fire and didn't know until my parents came running through my room. But great headphones otherwise!
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these because I have had several headphones fall apart after limited use. These ear buds are great. Built to last and the sound is great for me. I wear them while walking and traveling. The only small complaint is that the ear buds do expand into my ear and if I wear them for several hours at a time my ears start to get sore.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is amazing especially for the lows and bass. They are a little weird to put on and are not as comfortable as my cheaper pairs but they really do stay in
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do yourself a favor and buy some decent headphones. You deserve a pair of these. Buy them. If you've been using those cheap white headphones, you'll be amazed at what these IEM's give you."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were my first ""sound-isolating"" headphones, and I wish I had fully appreciated the meaning of that. They are, in essence, earplugs with a hole through which sound is piped. I found them awkward to put on due to their ""over-ear"" fit, uncomfortable to continue wearing, and bothersome to pop out when somebody wanted to talk to me. These are headphones to wear for the long haul -- a walk, a workout, or uninterrupted tasks.

I had no complaints about the sound quality, but coming from Bose IE headphones, the bass seemed quite light in comparison, and the sensation of sealing off my ears did not add to the experience.

Finally, after less than a week of usage, the left channel cut out -- but only when connected to my iPod. Apple products do seem to be pickier when it comes to connectivity and power chargers, but that's not much of an excuse. Other headphones work fine with the iPod, and the Shure headphones work with other devices.

I was disappointed with this product. The reviews were promising and they looked very cool, but they are not the answer for my needs. I've since purchased a pair of Bose IE2s and I am much, much happier."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Shure SE215-K are my first ""real"" headphones. I have been using skullcandy for a few years, and have been plagued with failures, they die within 6 months.
I decided to pay $100 for quality instead of $50 for junk. I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of these Shure 215's
I often travel on noisy airplanes, these are very effective in blocking out ambient noise, so you can enjoy your music. The way these block out background noise is also great in my workplace, however if you need to be aware of what's going on around you, these may block out too much noise.

These are comfortable, and appear to be reliable, time will tell how they hold up. I have had them for several weeks, and I am very pleased so far."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to finally shell out for a proper set of earbuds for riding my motorcycle and these were the most often-recommended on forums for that purpose. Having used a bunch of cheap earbuds and fairing acceptably well with them, it was tough to get myself to pay for these but I was about to ride a week-long trip and wanted to finally do it right. The short version is that they are totally worth the money. I will use these for the foreseeable future and am glad I paid for them.

The sound really is vastly better than any pair of cheap earbuds. Wind noise inside a less-than-very-well-designed motorcycle helmet can be surprisingly irritating to the point of being fatiguing, so before figuring out how to get earbuds to stay in while donning a helmet I had always worn disposable foam ear plugs, and good, more-expensive ones at that. These do a much better job blocking that noise, as well as making it easier to hear the quieter parts of music at the same time without jacking up the volume until you do permanent damage to your hearing.

I picked up the recommended triple flange sleeves but haven't tried them yet. The included soft black rubber sleeves have done a good job of sealing noise out and sound in, this is important as the better the seal the better they sound, and less volume is needed to be content with the sound which is important for both your long term hearing and short term endurance. If they make your ears sore after a while, try a different set of sleeves, there's a good reason they come with a bunch of different sizes.

The cords are pretty smart. They are easy to remove from the buds themselves but I haven't had them pull out of the buds while donning my helmet. There's a short length of stiffer, bendable wire at the bud ends that curves around the top of your ears which makes it much, much easier to keep the buds in your ears while putting on a helmet, which was a huge learning curve for me with cheap earbuds, and caused no end of frustration both to me and riding buddies who had to wait for me to get it right every time we'd get moving after a helmet-off stop during a single outing.

You probably won't get your money's worth from these if you aren't skilled at using a graphic equalizer. I run Jet Audio Plus on my Android phone and even with the included equalizer I find that while listening at home, I can adjust it for each track and improve my satisfaction. This is not viable or necessary while riding, but if you don't tune your audio source at all, you're wasting money on these. They sound as good as a $100 set of big fat over-the-ear studio headphones and most smartphones really don't drive them right in factory configuration. Start with a standard parabolic curve and bring the lower third up another point or two each. If using Jet Audio, try, from left to right (6, 5, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3). Adjust each up or down while listening to one track and see what works for you."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband loves them!! They are comfortable, the sound is amazing, and the do an excellent job of canceling out noise!!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I found Shure ear buds several years ago and fell in love with them. I use them while running and they have held up great. After my first pair finally gave out due to physical activity I bought a second pair which I use for running as well. You can't go wrong with Shure!
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it to listen to all types of metal and the sound quality is amazing.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my son per his request. He is pleased with them and uses them daily.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I fully agree with SK. Although this headset has great sound and isolation it is not able to be fully realized because the plugs are painful to the concha of the ear. It's difficult to listen to an entire album in one sitting because of the acute pain inflicted by the earphones that are much too wide and too deep. The awkward, heavy, inflexible cables don't lay well over the outside earlobe either. I'm not so wild about sound quality that I will tolerate the poor fit of these headphones -- so I say back to the drawing board, Shure."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,My $100 of pair Shure headphones broke in less than three months. The left earphone no loner works. I hope the company will replace them. I am pretty upset.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wear my headphones way to much. I find them very comfortable often wearing them without playing music just to knock down some noise. Their sound is far better than any comparably priced and slightly more expensive buds I've had. Their quality blows the competition away. I've had mine for a year plus now.... Get yourself some Comply tips. Loved these headphones from day one.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these! Feel very secure when placed properly. Really helps block outside sound. Was able to connect these to my Galaxy S7 with the case attached.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous model and was throughly satisfied, it was advertised to reduce ambient nosie by 15 db. This model is rated at 35 db which I doubt; however, I just think that the selection of earpads they sent aren't compatible with my ears canal. I'm going to call Shure and ask them about my concern, I'm sure they will send an assortment of ear 'plugs' that will block about more noise and permit the unit to stay in my ears.

I did meet with CS and they showed me how to properly insert the plugs. This new model is just great. They agreed that the instructions on how to insert the plugs needs to be updated."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If it's quality sound and noise isolation that you want, these are what you should buy."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what you’d expect from Shure. If you already own a par of Shure earbuds higher than the SE2xx series just buy the cable. If you don’t, pick these up instead. Best bang for your buck. Will they sound as good was Shure earbuds three or four times the price? No. But, they destroy everything else at or near this price point. I recommend these without reservation and have already have told friends and family to pick a pair up."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not usually tend to purchase in ear headphones. however I thought I would give it a shot and it was well worth it. This product not only sounds amazing, but they fit great in my ears, (which is usually my problem with earphones) and they come with multiple different attachments to fit different sized ears. I like that the cord goes over the ear so that they stay snug in your ears. They shipped very promptly and I would recommend these to anyone who is a passionate music listener."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've owned these for a year now and it beats the 15$ ones I used to get that kept breaking and sounded meh.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these things. They really block out the sound even at a fairly low volume. I think the sound quality is very good, but you may have to EQ the things to your taste."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for nearly seven months now. During this time they have been used nearly every day for several hours at a time. I use the medium foam tips and medium silicon tips mostly but have tried the large to see if the seal is better. With the large foam tips the seal was slightly better but they were too much pressure for my ears.
So while using the foam tips they provide such fantastic passive isolation that I couldn't hear anyone talk while wearing them even without anything playing. The silicon tips were slightly less isolating but still provide plenty for a pleasant experience. I use them while sleeping because of their extreme comfort. I can't believe how comfortable they are to sleep in. With their over-the-ear design and reinforced ear cable, they do not move. I move around a lot in my sleep and they have come out only a handful of times throughout my entire experience of using them. I really do love these. The sound is very nice has a fairly pronounced bass for the small drivers. Only thing I'd change is just better sound because the comfort is a 10/10 but the sound definitely falls in the 8/10 but still wonderful for the money. I've recommended these to multiple people and cannot recommend them enough to those who haven't paid more than 20 dollars on a pair of headphones before. They're moderately priced but definitely worth the investment."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these earbuds a few months ago. If you don't share an audio obsession with me, let me just summarize this whole review and say that these are without a doubt worth every penny. These earbuds are fantastic. Inevitably they will unfortunately wear out,and when that happens I'll get another pair.
Build Quality:
These guys have about as thick of a cable as I've ever seen on earbuds. It's a braided Kevlar cable that feels kind of textured-rubbery like. The earbuds themselves are made of a transparent plastic that lets you see all of the inner workings and little wires and stuff inside. Cool! These fit into your ear and then the cable goes over the top of your ear using a flexible length of the cord you can shape to match the way your ear is shaped. Not like those other earbuds that just fit right in and the cord doesn't rest against anything,these rest against the top of your ear where your glasses ride. I wear glasses and I have no issue wearing these and my glasses together. If you sweat a lot and or like to run I advise you to be careful with moisture buildup. Since the inner workings of the little speakers and the outside world are not separated by anything water/sweat can build up inside the earbuds. This happened to me a few times and each time they were just fine.
After using these a lot while running I had some issues with the sound going out in the right ear. fortunately you can replace the cables, so I bought an extra pair. What's strange though is the next day when I tried them again the next day they worked just fine. Maybe it was water inside that caused them to not properly work for a while. I'm still using the original cable 3 months later. Pick yourself up a spare cable anyway just to be safe so you can repair them when the cable eventually breaks( It'll take a while!). These come with a big 90° plug. It's big and sturdy compared to lesser audio equipment. HEFTY!
Sound:
These sound wonderful. You can hear the cymbals crash over there and the bass over here. They're very balanced and sound great no matter what you pipe through them. They do a good job of blocking out outside sounds so be careful to be aware of your surroundings when you wear them. If you like really low rumbly bass that really isn't here. They sound good with bass heavy songs,and they do HAVE bass, but they don't rumble the way a ""basshead"" set of earbuds would. Bass isn't everything though,and these sound awesome. Don't let the lack of ear quaking bass stop you from jammin' with these.
Features & Extra Stuff:
These come with a nylon zipper pouch, an ear wax removal tool( really useful!,don't lose it!!) the earbuds themselves and some memory foam and silicone earbuds tips in 3 sizes of each material. The pouch is not water proof or crush proof, has an inside mesh compartment for perhaps a spare cable or the ear tips and the cleaning tool. It provides just enough room to coil the earphones up without having to potentially damage them by winding them too tight. The pouch is pocket sized and has a small carabiner on the outside.

Excellent sound, excellent build quality, a steal of a price at 100USD as of July 31st 2015.
5 Stars!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a guitarist for my church band and mainly use these as in ear monitors for when I am on stage. For this purpose and the price, these headphones are great. The music can get pretty loud when I'm on stage, but I'm always able to hear everything I need to hear because of the fantastic seal/noise isolation.

As headphones for musical enjoyment in a quiet room or while I study for extended periods of time (multiple hours), there are other headphones in the same price range that will sound much better and will be more comfortable. To clarify: these headphones are comfortable and stay in your ear fine, but can get very uncomfortable after wearing them straight for a couple hours.

In summary: I recommend these for onstage in-ear monitoring because of the great sound isolation and the great entry pricepoint for in ear monitors. I would not recommend for extended listening for multiple hours."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired with my SE535 IEM's, the Shure RMCE-BT1 (henceforth ""BT1"") sounds as transparent, clear and correct as the 535's do with a cable connection. The unit arrived fully charged and instantly paired with my Apple iOS, WatchOS, and Mac devices.

Overall quality is as expected from Shure, with the wire-form ear section providing for a comfortable and completely secure solution and good-quality control feel.

The voice prompts are clear and professional sounding, and the Shure uniquely expresses battery life in available hours of use, which so far has proven slightly conservative- the unit is outperforming the predicted available time.

UPDATE: After 8 days daily use for 4-6 hours/day- every bit as favorable as the initial impression. Excellent connectivity, not one instance of a drop-out with an iPhone 7+ or iPad Air 2, averaging 7+ hours battery life driving my SE535's."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I sounds good but the plastic clip that connects it to you cloths broke within the week after I started using it. That clip is important because I'm always in fear of losing it. So now I use a metal office clip to attach it to my clothing. It is much stronger. I decided it was not worth calling and complaining about it. The product though gives the quality I was hoping for. I've only owned it a short time so I don't know if it will act like so many others that over time will
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these earphones for over a year, and I've just now had to replace the cables, for me that's great. Prior to my Shure SE215 headphones, I was going through headphones every 2 to 3 months. I'm a heavy headphone user and sleep with my earbuds in. I found the replacement cable for the earbuds on Amazon for 17 dollars, they are like new again. Love them!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile, but even I can tell the difference between these and other ""less expensive"" ear buds. I was amazed at the sound quality out of the box and did my own listening test vs. several other pairs of ear buds that I have. First pair test vs. the Shure were relatively cheap $20 Skull Candy. No comparison. Second pair tested were Bose IE2. Closer to discern between the Bose and the Shure, but the SE215-K is clearer, crisper and rich deep tones. The last pair that I tested was the Samsung phones that come with a Galaxy S4 smart phone. Again, no comparison, Not even close.
The only downside was it was a bit difficult to change to try a different type of sleeves. It took a little time and patience to figure out, but ultimately not too bad if done carefully.
They fit great and feel great wearing them. I never tried the over the ear style before, but they are really comfortable and secure. I've only had them a couple of weeks, but they work well for every use I've used, from walking to riding my motorcycle and using them with my Sena SMH10 Bluetooth com system."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earbuds on December 16th, 2016, so as of 10/13/2017 I have almost owned these for an entire year.

Wear and comfort: 9/10
Why the lost point? These can be SLIGHTLY uncomfortable to wear for over an hour. The bendable cable portion that runs just above the ear does not stay bent often floats slightly above the ear.

Cable quality: 9/10
The cable feels very solid, and has been holding up very well since purchase. The cable does bend a little, but it does not bend into sharp angles.
I reduced 1 point because the plastic casing that surrounds the bendable section directly above the ear has cracked slightly on the left side and is exposing the (presumably) steel cable reinforcement.

Packaging and Assortments: 10/10
The carrying case is well made, I have not seen any noticeable wearing. In one side of the case there is a small mesh partition to store the included accessories. Included is 3 different sizes of silicone tips and 3 different sizes of ""spongy"" tips reminiscent of ear plugs. (all in a plastic bag) and a wax pick with a wire and plastic nub tips.

Sound: 9/10
Since everyone and their cousin seems to be a bass head, I'll start there. Low end is decent, producing enough punch to notice and feel it deep in your brain but overall, it lacks the quality definition to notice subtle changes in low end pitch. One could say it sounds a little muddy. Bass drops out around 30Hz. The SE-215 really shines in the mid to high frequencies, my two favorites to listen to. Mids: Vibrant yet smooth. Well defined. Maybe a cloud shrouded but overall excellent. Highs: Also vibrant, and smooth. Sound insulation is a WOW, with the spongy tips producing the best all round frequency insulation, followed by the silicone tips which insulate well, but let higher frequencies such as keyboard typing and scratching wood through. The silicone tips sound the best for mids and highs, while the ""spongy"" tips absorb the higher frequencies easily producing a low end focused experience. Cable noise insulation is decent, but movement along clothing is noticeable but not experience ruining.

Overall, I have not regretted buying these."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the Shure SE215-K, in tandem with the westone UM pro10's, to do a comparison on these two companies entry level high end IEM (in ear monitors). Between the two i spent about 40 hours on these headphones and here are my initial thoughts:

1) i thought that the Shures were more consumer driven, as the low end is alot more accentuated as there is probably a bump in the 50-300 range.
this could be good for stage performers that need to hear that bass response in loud enviornment.

2) the Westones were a lot more flat in the frequency response, specifically in the low end, and as expected it was a lot more honest in the high end. There is a lot of accuracy with the Um10's. an application of these Specific IEMS would be more towards studio use and less towards live use.

3) Fit. The Westones had a much better system for fit. but this could be partially due to my person physiology, rather than actual design.

Overall, these are two really great headphones, and it really depends on the application in which you need some IEM's. The Westones are the more expensive between the two, being 50% more than the Shures. The sound quality between the two units is superb, but it recommendation between the two models depends on what you want to do with it."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Shure 215s are the best earbuds I’ve ever owned. The RMCE-BT1 just made them even better! The sound quality is still excellent with only slightly noticeable drop in the low end. That said though these ear buds have never been known for their deep bass. The controls are easy to use and intuitive. Bluetooth set up was a breeze as well. I highly recommend the RMCE-BT1 and would buy them again in a second, even though they are greatly overpriced."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife had a pair of Shure EC3s she purchased in 2006 for $135 and worked great until she left them in the plane on a flight home from Chicago last month. The SE215s are superior in sound qaulity and construction, and just as good in fit and comfort. The zip pouch does not have a spool inside like the EC3s but it works fine."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic earbuds! Great sound quality and superior build quality. The ability to replace the cord is definitely a plus too. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around design, but it does keep them from falling out."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality earphones. Blocks out most of the ambient sound without blasting my ears.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has an awesome reputation for high quality sound equipment, but they dropped the ball on this one. These earbuds sounded tinny. The highs were muddled as well as the mid and low ranges. I sent them back."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for a great price! These buds fit and perform with the best of them. My first pair of Shures eventually wore out after 5+ years and when it was time to replace them, I had no doubt I would stay with Shure."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's be clear on what we have with the Shure SE-215's: the in ear monitors are an excellent fit, with tips that should comform to almost any ear size. They are very comfortable to wear and seal well vs. outside noise. Yet the key factor in a headphone rating for me is the sound. While sound is a subjective rating, in my opinion this product is not much better than standard iPhone earbuds. They are good at reproducing mid-range, however there is no punch on the bottom end. I even tried adjusting the EQ on my player to increase bass, and the results didn't do much for me. Let me clearly state -- I am NOT a bass head. But I do want a balanced playback across the spectrum.

The reality is the fit is exceptional which is the saving grace of this product. Perhaps a higher end version of these monitors would deliver the sound I prefer and expect."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can tell a difference between this and cheap earbuds.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whenever I try using a different pair of ear buds I always end up coming back to these.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm fairly disappointed with these to be honest. They sound OK, but for the price I would have hoped for a little more midrange clarity and the top end has a sibilant fizziness that I assume is a compression artifact from the dated bluetooth spec these support. I may get a wired cable to see if the problem is in the actual drivers or if it's just the bluetooth receiver. On the plus side the foam tips are pretty snug and isolate well.

Wearing these around the battery pack & controls make wearing pretty uncomfortable. The whole contraption swings around a lot with moderate physical activity. I'll stick to my wired Etymotics and a pair of cheap Anker BT buds."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of in-ears for the money! Why spend more than double the price if you don't have to? Playing lead guitar, I use them with a wireless transmitter/receiver pack and am free to roam the stage...awesome!!!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not great. Quite honestly expected a lot more balanced sound and richer bass for the price point."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass and sound details and superior fit/feel and sound isolation.

The ability to remove the buds from the cable is a nifty feature is case of damage but the wire feels pretty robust so I doubt that'll happen during everyday use.

In short, these earbuds are easily the best headphones I ever bought. I'm happy with this purchase."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earphones for such a great price. I'm a huge fan of Shure. As a bassist myself I appreciate the deep and clear sound of the bass that these earphones give me. It has a nice response to treble too. It also looks really cool.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite earphones for Shure! Use them on airplanes and for recording webinars. The best!
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are some great earbud headphones better then the last pair I had that gave out in two months (denon Ah-250). Sometime it's hard to get in but once their in they don't come out and the sound is awesome the bass and mids sound great. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for something different.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these, bought them because I lost my 4 year old predecessor pair. The audio quality is stunning, from lows to highs with little to no distortion."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good. Fit in my ears isn't gread, but that's probably my own fault as most ear buds don't fit me well. It could use a clip on the wire to clip to your collar to keep the wire from pulling down in the earpieces."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones. The first lasted five years of heavy use before the cable failed. I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable. The quality is outstanding....the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me better than any other brand). The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble. However, these do have a somewhat forward, slightly heavy sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some other quality earphones have (the Etymotic HF2's have a much more precise, although light on bass, sound). That said, I think that 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's. In the future I'll probably buy some higher end Shure's but for now these are great. My only real complaint is the cost of the iPhone cable sold separately (see my separate review). Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed behind the ear for a secure fit. something that some glasses wearers (again, myself included) can find a little awkward at times."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty decent sound quality, I don't have any other item at this price point to compare them to. I think they're worth the money."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just replaced my Beats earbuds with these and love them. Nice rich sound & they keep out the outside noise much better than the Beats. Glad I switched.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my needs!
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially, it did take some effort to get the buds to fit comfortably in my ear. However, once configured properly, these ear buds are comfortable for an extended period of time, and sound amazing."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I've had them for about 5 months or so and they satisfy. Does block a lot of noise out. I have to use an equalizer to get the right sound but the stock sound isn't bad
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately the left earphone cut out after a week. I have heard that this is a somewhat common thing with these earphones. I enjoyed the sound and It was nice that they came with Foam Tips as I think they offer better sound isolation, but will not be buying them again due to them cutting out within a week or so."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So the Shure SE215 Blacks are my 3rd pair of earphones over $50.00 that I've purchased in the last year. Prior to the Shure's I had the Klipsch S4i's and the Beats Tour HD. Without a doubt the Shure's beat both sets. The Klipsch had a poor fit for me and lasted about 4 months. The strain reliefs weren't very good and eventually I lost signal in the right channel. In comparison, the Shure's are designed in the professional monitor way and the strain on cables stops at the top of the ear instead of at the hub. Additionally having a replaceable cable helps too. The Beats Tour HD's were a disaster, especially for 150 bucks. They also had poor fit and the although the ribbon cable was interesting, it wasn't very sturdy and quickly sustained a tear through the rubber. The right channel on these also went out in less than 4 months. As far as fit goes for the Shure's, these actually are designed to fit in the ear comfortably and the foam cushions seal up really well. It takes a minute to get used to the cables going over the ears. The sound is tough to qualify. Its for sure less punchy that the Beats but that is to be expected. I'm using an iPod Touch 4th gen and tried both the standard music player program and EQu with a customized equalizer setup. The standard music player emphasizes the base alot. Using a custom equalizer setup, you can dial down the bass a bit and bring out the mid's and highs. The Shure's sound great after some tweaking. Overall I would definitely recommend these monitors over the Klipsch's and Beats at the price range."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my church band, this is the first time I've used in ears. Clean and clear, good separation in the frequency ranges. Lows stand out, the mids and highs sing. LOVE THEM!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hurt my ears. Stiff wire near the buds making a comfortable fit impossible. My Sony's are very comfortable and sound better and cost 40% less.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I like the sound quality and all, but you have to dig the earbuds so deep into your ears it almost feels unnatural. It also takes a lot of messing around to put them in correctly. They're not really mobile earbuds. The design just isn't for me. I returned these a day later. Don't let my bad experience deter you from getting these though they sound great, just not the style I like."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,amazing sound. after a while you have to wiggle or wrap the cords a certain way to get the sound to come out of both (and not just one) of the headphones. Had this happen in other Shures too
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clean sound, after they are broken in the bass is solid, highs are not brittle and there is a great mid range. Take you time on the wires over the ears and they are comfortable, these blow the Bose out of the water !"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sounds produced by the SE215. Very well balanced and the Bass is not too heavy but still packs a punch.

I would say it is one of the best earphones in the under $100 group.

Only thing to consider is the unusually long cables that comes with the SE215. I aint very tall so when im using the SE215 with my phone, the excess cables can be a hassle.

But if you dont have a problem with cable length, i highly recommend getting the Shure SE215"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Could not get them to fit. At all. With any earpad. It was like trying to stuff a shoe in my ear. I have not problems with my Shure 530s.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering the features and usability of many other Bluetooth options, this cable is a little archaic. Reminds me of the first Bluetooth jaybirds I bought for working out. This cord is extra funky in that it's big and the plastic housing makes it feel cheap. On the plus side, I don't see too noticeable of a difference in sound. However, i'm certainly no audiophile. I bought the earphones about 8 years ago and have used them mainly on short flights (<8 hours) to block out airport/plane noise. Why 4 stars? For my uses it's great. Easy upgrade to some old, but pricey ear buds. I just love how comfortable my Shure's are and how well they block out noise. Pros: no problems pairing to my iphone X, Ipad etc. Sound is good enough, no noticeable hissing so far (literally just took it out of the box and tested for an hour only). Cons: cord is really weird and cumbersome. Voice does not seem to work very well. Siri had no idea what i was saying. even holding the mic right up to my mouth. I'll do some more research. Perhaps my mic is broken. Rather use my old jawbone anyway than having the weird cord wrapped around my neck."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are what I expected and sound ok for my band. Not too expensive and I use them with the MiPRO wireless system.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is ok, but the stiffened wires and unpluggable connections are a giant FAIL
The wires are ""stiffened"" for about three inches out of the buds. I suppose someone thought this would make the wires form around the ear. For what reason? But in fact, they actually PREVENT the wires from forming around the ear, which leaves the wires difficult to deal with, and I'm in an extremely hot climate near Cambodia, where the malleability of the plastic shrouds over the wires would be greatest. Imagine trying to deal with them in a cool or cold climate. Regular wires work just fine and fit far better around the ears. Also, the plugin connections between the wires and the buds are for....what? When they twist and turn they introduce scratchy noises, which you know, you KNOW will only get worse in time as dirt finds its way into the connections. No doubt these little connections contributed to the high price, but I cannot see that they serve any purpose whatsoever, only headaches. I have a set of &12.95 Skull Candys that I am going back to. Same sound. Fewer annoyances. More wasted money on Amazon."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound GREAT! Love they are detachable
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Took me a couple weeks before I realized how to properly insert these things. I was on the verge of sending them back when I realized I was using them incorrectly. Once I figured that out I realized the great sound quality. It's not the best I've ever heard but it's probably in the top 3. So I would recommend this product. FYI I use the large foam ear pieces.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good thank you
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Took forever to get them to fit. Got to be patient and wrap the wire just so. Once in they are fine with good sound. If I press on them with my fingers the sound really improves telling me that I need the foam or flange sleeves. I'm not made of money and don't think I need to pay this much for ear buds and then have to upgrade them. A friend just bought a competitors brand and says they came with sleeves. Will check it out.
The pair that I bought for a gift may have a loose wire leading to the left bud. I'll have to ask for them back to check it out. Nice gift huh?
Maybe I'll just walk around with my fingers pressed to the buds. I should have noticed that the majority of reviews started with ""I got mine free or at a discount"". Not sure what else is out there but wish I had a discount."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I unboxed these earphones not twenty minutes ago and was greeted by sound dropouts from broken connections in the cable, which is super frustrating because when they work properly with some persuasion they sound great for $99. So excellent earbuds, but even though cables are a problem for all headsets it's a real pain to have to ship back the whole kit straight out of the box, especially as it's a detachable cable."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earphones.They are sturdy and durable. The fact that the ear buds are detachable is a plus.I would buy again.

The sound is WoW good mods highs and lows. I have become a shure customer for life although the prices are a little steep.."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great sounding for sure. I used these headphones at work where i am constantly lifting things and moving around. My sessions with these headphones would be anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of straight listening and I must say I did enjoy the sound! My only problem was the overall design on the headphones. This was my first over the ear experience and I must admit that I did not enjoy it for long term use.

Pros,
Sound isolation was insane! I work in a cold box for the majority of my shift and I could not hear any rattling from the generator used to power it.
Sound overall was very good and well balanced. Personally more of a bass head myself but thoroughly enjoyed my time with these headphones.
Cord is long and thick making it very durable
Earpiece selection that is given to you is amazing and the foam sleeve as they call it makes it hard to go back to the standard silicone.

Cons,
- Biggest con for me was the detachable cable. I ended up losing one of the ear pieces because this was my daily driver. I did not have time to use the case and therefore lost one. Very disappointing because if you lose one the pair is pretty much useless.
- Over the ear design hurt my ears after long use, mainly on the top of my ear where the cable wrapped.
- Personally did not like the L shaped headphone jack, as I moved around I pulled it out several times by accident!

The sound quality is there and the noise cancellation is some of the best I have ever heard. However, if you are like me and are wanting to use this as your daily driver for long interval listening i would recommend you look at something else for this price range."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic! Light years ahead in SQ from even the mid-grade old in ear buds from Shure! And those were over 2x the cost of these!

These sound great and are comfortable, but I don't believe they were meant for use at the gym. I think sweating fried something inside the headphone causing it to not work properly."

These earphones are well built with a rugged construction. The cord is thick and does not get tangled. They have a secure fit. They fit in the ear. the cord wraps around the ear and then you can tighten the cord behind you head. That makes them great for exercising and running.

The one short coming is that they have absolutely no bass.

Update 12-20-13 Shure has excellent customer service. I had the ear buds about 14 months when the cord broke. They came with a 2 year warranty. I mailed the damaged ear buds to Shure and received a brand new pair within two weeks. Thanks Shure."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched multiple earphones and ended up ordering these because the reviews were good...besides an occasional complaint about having to get used to fitting them around your ear correctly.

After testing them out myself, here is what I came up with:

Pros:

1) Sound was pretty amazing, especially for the price. I was also testing out some other earphones at the time that were $100 more than the SE215's, and I really couldn't tell the difference. Bass punched well and felt like the perfect amount, although might not be enough for someone who was expecting to be blown away. The mids and highs were clear as well, I really had no complaints about the sound. The isolation was also really good, the fitting around the ear and the way they fit in the ear really made sure of that. I was really satisfied when it came to this.

2) They're secure in the ear. I mowed with them for an hour and a half and didn't have to readjust them once. Although many people complained about having difficulties wrapping it around the ear, once you get it figured out, it's really an easy task and is what keeps them on so well.

3) The earphone wire is think and has an ""L"" shape at the end, so it's pretty durable. It's also detachable, so if it does get damaged, you can just buy another wire instead of having to buy a whole new pair of earphones.

Cons:

1) I have small ears. The earbuds themselves, (not the sleeves, which you can change to a smaller/larger size), are rather large. No matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stay in like they should have. And since I had so much trouble getting them to fit correctly, within about 20 minutes I could feel my ears getting sore from them. Again, this had nothing to do with the sleeves, but the earbuds themselves. No complaint on their part, I simply have small ears.

2) Changing the sleeves was a real challenge. They sit on a plastic thing, (great description, I know) and you have to take your fingernails and slide the plastic thing off. While this is great because it means the original sleeves won't fall off anytime soon, it sucks trying to change them because you feel like you're going to destroy the sleeves in the process. After some practice though, I'm sure it'd be easier to do.

3) Although I complimented the earphone cable in the ""pros"", since it is pretty long and heavy, it can be somewhat awkward and isn't extremely good for a lot of moving around, as it can make some cable noise. There's also no mic, so to change the music you have to take your phone/whatever you're using out of your pocket and manually change it. Of course that is in the description, so I knew of that beforehand.

I would give them a 5 star for the sound/isolation and for the price, I was very pleased with that. But in the end, I personally couldn't stand the discomfort (due to my small ears) and ended up returning them."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things sound incredible and are very comfortable.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned them as I didn't like the way they sounded at all. On the plus side, they were comfortable even with the side of my head buried in a pillow."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a big fan of Shure for at least 10 years now and there is one big problem I always had with the SE215. The cable is too damn long. This problem was exacerbated by the iPhone 7 and its dongle instead of a headphone jack. With this i decided to give Jaybird X2s, and Jaybird freedoms a try.

Jaybird X2: These never fit my ears right. I found the foam tips to be very uncomfortable. They have some a texture to them that just doesn't agree with me. The silicon tips feel like sticking suction cups in my ears, and the wing tips cause my ears fatigue after about 20 minutes.

Jaybird Freedom: Better for me than the X2 as the foam sleeves are similar to the Shure but not as good quality. After about 2 weeks of use they would fall apart.

Back to Wired Shure: I was working out one day and got the cable caught on my knee. I was done with this long cable. I was about to break down and buy the Jaybird Freedom 2. Then I saw them.

Shure SE215 Bluetooth: This solves 80% of my problems with the wired 215s.
Pros: Mostly Wireless (make some truly wireless version of these and i'm in regardless of the cost)
The cable is detachable so i could use them if up upgrade to one of the better models, and it has a clip to keep the cable from bouncing around. You can also wear these in front of the neck or behind.

Cons: Who ever came up with the battery indicator should be reassigned. It just gives you lines like ""more than 2 hours left). That's not that useful. These are also devoid of any cool features like fitness tracking. My opinion though get an apple watch or a fitbit if you want that kind of nonsense.

Bluetooth performance: For me they cut out one time while I was setting up for a bench press. They have not cut out sense.

Conclusion: If Shure earbuds fit your ears and you want them mostly wireless get these."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Remarkable earbuds, under $100! I've had these incredible earphones for 4 years and I'm still amazed at the quality of sound they produce. They compare with earbuds twice the retail cost, and blow away everything else at this price point. I use other headphones for my line of work (as a filmmaker and video / sound artist) such as my pair of Sennheiser HD25-1 II, and these little Shure earbuds are right up there in quality and clarity. Once you get the right seal, the bass is unbelievable.

Another note: I've twice wrecked the right channel by snagging them on camera rigging. Both times, Shure has sent out replacements for free. Free! I've always offered to pay for replacement right cabling or driver components (they come apart easily), but Shure has simply replaced the entire earphone set - both drivers, new cables, and a new carrying case both times. Outstanding technical service, which is hard to find these days. They're based in the Chicago area and, thus, send out replacement parts within a few days, not like some other companies which still use China as a distribution hub, thousands of miles away. I like buying from Shure - a dedicated audio brand - and will do so in the future. Keep up the great customer service and technical achievements Shure!"

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have been reading qualitative and quantitative reviews for probably the biggest market right now, earbuds in the $100 range.

Obviously these aren't going to be your bottom basement earbuds but they aren't going to be world class monitor earbuds either. I think it's a great range for your enthusiast who is willing to spend some extra money for a better product.

Initial Comments: I have had a few good earbuds but most of them are almost disposable. I was in the market for earbuds around $100, give or take a few bucks. I had narrowed it down to these Shures and the Sony MDR-510. I have always been partial to Sony earbuds since I bought a bluetooth headset for my phone to listen to music w/o cords to the phone. The only issue is the Shure's are widely recognized and reviews are aplenty. The Sonys were just released and almost little to no decent reviews by any major website or amazon. I chose the Shures and it's almost a regret.

Pros: First off the cord seems up to the job. It feels heavy and somewhat stiff, it's not going to rip under normal usage. Some don't like the long cord but I do (although the Sony's have an option for a long cord or short). The case is normal, a stock item in this level of earbuds. I like the different sizes / materials for the earbuds as well. The little tool to clean the earbuds is a nice touch (I'm a bit of a germophobe). I like the replaceable cords. The earbuds look nice but that doesn't really matter to me since I want performance and performance they give. Obviously I have never had this level of earbud but there are definitely the best I've had. That being so, I felt some of the reviews overly hyped these earbuds. I get over the ""new product hype"" and take a more pessimistic view for almost all of my purchases. They fit really comfortably in my ears and I love I can lay down with them in. I have been flying to and from the states to Asian countries so comfort for 14 hour flights was a must. These work well.

Cons: So obviously they're great headphones but I feel people want to hear the short comings more so than overall praise. First, these are the first earbuds I have had that wrap the cord around the top of the ear and down. While that helps keep the cord out of the way and more stable, the cord is too stiff and so they kind of don't hug my ear well. Sometimes the cord itself ""swings"" away from my ears and hits my cheek. I have tried to bend them to be more tight against my ear but to no avail. Also I wear glasses, sometimes taking off sunglasses or my glasses will pull on the cord.

The biggest con I have so far is intermittent cutting off of sound. I don't know if it's these particular pair or the earbuds themselves, I have not see anyone else have this issue. Sometimes I move around and my left earbud will cut out of sound. Now it's kind of random because I will bob my head around and it won't cut off. Mind you I am sitting the whole time, I'm not running or exercising. I have never had an earbud cutout like this. Maybe it's the fact that the cords are replaceable is causing the cutoff. I find this has almost ruined my whole experience with these earbuds. Unfortunately I bought these a week before I left the country and have been gone for 4 weeks (I'm still out of the country). So I can't return them although if Shure's warranty is as great as I hear, I shouldn't have a problem getting them replaced, fixed, whatever is necessary to have them not cut out. $100 pair of headphones shouldn't cut out, even my cheap $15 audio tecknica's have never had this issue.

So there you go. Yes there are very good, probably one of the top sub-$100 earbuds. They are comfortable and should last. The only reason it's getting 3 stars right now is the cutoff. I mean that is almost a deal breaker at this price."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great. And after getting used to them, they become very easy to put in and tighten up.

My only complaint is, they don't come with a clip to attach the cord to the back of a collar or to a tag on the back of a shirt. Over ear mics come with these to prevent pulling. As a guitar player, if I put these on with the cord in the back, the guitar strap will eventually pull on the cord and then pulls on the ear buds.

My solution: Alligator clips. I attached alligator clips to the rubber part where the cord Y's. Once clipped to the back of my shirt, his gives me enough slack to move my head around and enough cord to run under my shirt. This works great for both the stage as well as listening to my phone in my back pocket."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I listened to an album that I'm very familiar with, and was amazed at how much detail it brought out. The sound isolation is fantastic, although at times I wish I could hear more of the world around me when walking."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best I've ever used. I don't know what to say that's bad. The sound is crisp and deep. Nothing ""added"" no ""extra bass"" or anything. If you want that, that's what the EQ is for. They seal in your ear. On airline travel they block out just about all of the noise. When I cant grab my BOSE noise canceling, I grab these. They are with me all the time. I don't wear them to work out, so can't answer about being sweat-proof. Like I said they seal, so when I am at the gym, I want to be able to hear things around me a little. When music is playing, you can't hear any background voices/noise. Love the way the cord is ""stiff"" the first few inches to wrap behind your ear, very secure. Prevents cable noise when it rubs on your clothing that I have had in past headphones."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Shure products, and this pair of headphones is no exception. The sound fidelity is excellent, I'd say they probably sound better than any set I've ever had. I have a pair of over-ear Beats Pro (Detox) that I got as a gift, and in my opinion, though being half the price, these sound twice as good. The low range is great, bass is deep when you want it to be, and they get plenty loud with no distortion. I like foam earbuds, and the ones included fit very well and reduce environment sound by a lot. Standing on the subway platform, I sometimes get startled by trains approaching because I don't hear them coming until they pass me.

I rely a lot on my headphones due to my NYC commute, taking buses and subways. It's very noisy. These headphones truly are great, and worth every penny.

The only thing I'm not 100% fond of is the over-ear wire thing. It works great, and I get it, but sometimes I wish they were just regular earbuds because they can be difficult to put in at times. Not difficult, just a little weird. Once they're in, though, you have to physically take them out. They won't fall. I have had no issues with them to date."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To my ears these buds sound fantastic and produce a deep, rich sound! The passive noise cancelation is great! I work in a small office where the constant coworker chatter was driving me nuts and effecting ability to focus on my programming! My old set of buds had to be played on high volume to even begin to drown out the chatter and even then they never completely dampened the noise. With the correct sleeve and with music playing on low to medium volume, these buds block out ALL external noise without damaging my eardrums or giving me a headache. No joke, I don't hear anything but my music! The ""over the ear"" style takes some getting used to but it didn't take long. While I use these earbuds primarily for work, they sit nearly flush with my outer ear making them comfortable to wear while sleeping as well. I've owned various models of Shure earbuds over the last 10 years and these do not disappoint. They might be a bit pricey but worth every penny in my opinion, especially with the 2 year warranty that Shure offers. My one complaint would be the lack of a microphone on the base model."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I dont know if i was just super excited and expected a new world of sound when buying these, but i was somewhat not impressed by these headphones. I like them, just not impressed. Anyways. I received these headphones earlier than expected. Im new to IEM and sound isolated headphones. They are very comfortable when you get them in but they are a pain to get them in in the first place. Which i assume ill get better over the months i use them. I bought these to play drums with my band, which are perfect! The headphones blocks most things out but just enough so that i can hear what the headphones are pushing through and a little of what my band plays, and my band is LOUD. Anyways, for all those casual users out there, the sound quality is just like your typical semi-high quality headphones. The highs mids and lows are all there, but thats the same as dre beats, skullcadies, even the new apple headphones. Not trying to bash, but for people that are crazy insaine about music and quality, go with something higher up, for those that want a dependable product and dont wanna her a jet engine take off right in front of them while listening to their jams, go with these!

Or if your crazy rich go with the 846's i heard those headphones introduce your brain to a whole new world of sound, almost as if you were seeing new colors for the first time. But hey, thats just what i heard!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, this is a review of the Shure SE215 in-ear headphones, or in-ear monitors (IEM), but it's also a story of terrific customer service that's indicative of long-term thinking on the part of Shure.

Before I dive into the Shure's, I'll give a bit of background of my musical preferences and what I'm looking for in headphones. I like clean natural sound. I typically avoid using equalizers and like my experience to be close to the natural sound of what's produced. I typically listen to classical, jazz, folk and pop, but my musical taste are fairly eclectic and across the board. Throw in a little R & B and dubstep over the top of Lindsay Sterling and you have it. So while I want to sense the thump in Bruno Mars' Grenade I want to hear clarity in Anne Akiko Meyer's playing of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I hate bass emphasis especially if it results in muddy sound.

I also want to note that I'm no audio expert, 80% of my listening is done on my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 920) and I probably spend as much or more time listening to audio books on the Audible app as I do listening to music. Most of my music is streamed from Beats Music service at 320 kbs or downloaded from Amazon at 256 kps vbr. If it's local, it's encoded either at 320 kps MP3 or vbr 320 kps WMA. All of this is to say, this is real world listening, mostly using my smartphone in a normal, active life. So while I'm serious about music, you could even say passionate, I'm not a hard-core audiophile who worries if his cables touch the carpet.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm really astounded by the sound isolation ability of these headphones. I can wear them in an airplane with crying babies and not even have to turn up my music more than one click over what I use outside the airplane (and I don't listen all that loudly). I can also wear them on a bike or as a passenger in a car with the windows rolled down and I can still hear perfectly well with almost normal sound levels.

It's really important to get a tight seal though, but it comes with like, 6 different ear fittings so you can experiment with different fits.

Also, I like the hard wire that you can wrap around the the top of your ear to help keep it in place. These very rarely fall out, even when working out and exercising.

The sound quality is also quite good. I have big can headphones, so it's definitely a downgrade from them, but considering how small, portable, performance in windy/hot/loud areas, and how convenient these are, it's well worth the drop in quality. Besides, they're better than all other in ear headphones I've tried in every sense."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent addition if you already have a set of shure earphones. Great battery life and decent quality, I would like to have seen the braided wire that comes with the heigher end earphones made by them. Caution though! It’s a wireless connection, therefore the sound quality will be affected by it. Specially if you have the 535 and up, the souls will not be as rich and full. They are handy though."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find these to sound extremely neutral and a little boring to listen to without an EQ and headphone amp. They have a true monitor sound. I prefer to listen to them with my headphone amp - this is where they really shine. When amplified these little guys can put out some impactful sub-bass down to 35htz while keeping the balance of your music in check. Meaning, the mids and high's are not distorted. I will say the 4k area of these IEM's can be a bit harsh sounding, but a simple adjustment to the EQ can correct that.

I have around 80 hours on them currently. I do not know if they need a burn in, but I did the usual day of alternating pink-white sound, then the rest of the time with a variety a music ranging from rock, metal, electronic and dub. I wish i could say the sound changed, but I don't think it did. Unlike some headphones that really re-shape themselves after a burn in, these just seem to remain consistent, clear and fun to listen to.

If you are going to listen to them on your phone or tablet, you might not be too excited about them, but with a good amp and equalizer, i find these to be a very warm, full sounded IEM, and would purchase them again should I lose or break mine."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I'd like to say that these IEMs are very well constructed. Rugged design, replaceable cable, and all major junctions are reinforced. I foresee these lasting much longer than the comparable Audio Technica's, Skull Candy, etc. that I've owned. However, where I was surprised that Shure fell a little short with these is the overall sound. Don't get me wrong, they're leagues beyond any of the main stream brands (i.e. Skull Candy, Beats, etc) for the price. However, the mids are quite overwhelming and it's pretty lacking in the highs (2.4kHz and up). You can clean most of it up with an EQ but you really need to boost the highs or just sounds plain muddy (maybe it's just too warm for my liking). I'm mildly disappointed in this respect (and I hate to compared IEMs to closed ear headphones but...) because for ~$30-40 more dollars you can get the Audio Technica M50's which blow these out of the water. For the price tag of $100 I would've expected these to perform much better, especially because they're Shures.

Recommendation: Bottom line, these are fantastic IEMs in terms of ruggedness of construction and are good in terms of sound quality for the average (or even above average) listener. However, if you've got a picky ear you'll find these overwhelming warm even run through a EQ. Not unbearable but I would probably splurge on the two-driver model of these Shures because they're bound to be a more satisfying audio experience than these."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these IEM's and after reading lots of reviews I wanted to state the following: all earbuds with dynamic drivers need some break in time, please believe this. If you think that they will sound the same right out of the box, as opposed to after you listen to them for many hours, you are wrong in that assumption. I own several pairs and purchased these for their boost in bass response over the less expensive Shure model. I listened to them out of the box and then after every ten hours of break in. You can use white noise CD's or the like but here's what has worked for me breaking in 4 to 5 pairs in the past 6 months. Get yourself an adapter plug and plug your IEM's into your receiver or your boombox or your radio. Put them on and raise the sound level to where they are comfortable then take them off and crank it up to where you can hear them while you're holding them in your hand. Play talk radio for 10 hours, rock music for 10 hours, classical music for 10 hours and after every 10 hour session listen to the IEM's. The difference with the SE215's after 30 hours was striking, no sibilance, the midrange and the lows were so much clearer and deeper. After another 30 hours I can honestly say that for 100 bucks these buds are definitely worth it. Now having said that, I also have to state that a pair of Monster N-Lites that I paid 60 bucks for after 20 hours of break in sounded almost as good as the Shure SE215-K's I purchased. What's my point? There are a lot of really good earbuds in the 50 to 100 dollar range. the Shures are excellent and I use them at home for their superior bass and I use the N-Lites for the gym and running. I own and highly recommend the RHA-MA750's, the HiFiMan's for 99 bucks, the Klipsh Image S-4's and the Monster Turbos that I paid 100 bucks for. I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my music and just like speakers I find that headphones and IEM's all seem to have sonic signatures all their own. The SE215's are a superior product, with a 2 year warranty, replaceable cords and once broken in, sound quality above the purchase price. When I listen to my laptop through my Dragonfly DAC and the Shure SE215's I am one happy camper. Folks, I can be more technical and try to impress you with terms that make me sound like the audiophile I am but what's the point of that? These are for 100 dollars worth every cent.
After break in I had to turn the volume down even lower and was amazed at how well these IEM's performed and gave that sense of being outside of my head. Audio is very subjective, what one person hears another may not, that's why I listen through differing pairs. That and the fact that I'm a bit maniacal about my music! When I am ready to spend more on IEM's the 315's or 415's will be the ones I buy from Shure and I must add, Amazon's service is beyond belief. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I reiterate, break them in for sonic bliss, a minimum of 40 hours before critical listening."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEMs are great for musicians. I am a lead guitarist and lead vocalist in my church band and I use these with an Aviom/wireless monitoring setup. The sound of these is basically warm, with full bass, enhanced midrange (awesome for vocals), and just enough treble to keep it from sounding dark. I would not call these ""flat"" by any means, but I find them to be excellent for live performance. More reviews on these can be found on HeadFi which I recommend checking out if you are not convinced here.

My favorite tips for these so far are the Shure yellow foam ones found here: Shure EAYLF1-10 Foam Sleeves (10 Included/5 Pair) for SCL3, SCL4, SCL5, E3c, E4c, E5c, E500 & SE Earphones (Yellow). These give me the most balanced sound of all of the included tips and the Comply tips I tried."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, but can tell a huge difference between these and low end models. I don't think I would be able to pick out difference or want to pay for the next step up as the quality difference would be marginal and very pricey.
I like these because they fit directly in the ear and fit very snug, creating a nice sound cave."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highest quality audio ive heard in the ballpark of this price. Very precise lows and mids. The only con of these are that they lack the bass of higher end shures
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these when mowing the grass on my John Deere LA-175 lawn tractor. I can keep the volume down to a level that won't destroy my ears and the mower sound is greatly attenuated. I can still hear enough to know if there is a problem with the mower. These are great if you need sound isolating ear buds.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I experience fallouts when i am running. 5 times on a 5 km trip. Quit annoying. And bluetooth still can't be used as IEM, because of a lot of latency."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once I got these earbuds, it took about a day and a half before I got them to fit the way I wanted. After that, the sound was much like my audio technica ath-m50's with a little cleaner highs and a little stronger bass and greater isolation. Overall, a relatively flat sound with a slight v curve. Well worth the money and time to get the fit right. I ride the bus to school all the time and these block out nearly all the sound of the bus and other passengers."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned some of my music for several decades, but now, listening to it with these earphones I feel like I am hearing it for the first time! These are extremely well made and worth the money for what they deliver!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great set of earbuds. You'll be spoiled after owning them and will never go back to $30 sets.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones after losing my Sony MDR Ex-series earbuds at school. I loved those headphones as they were comfortable and provided excellent sound quality (balanced hi's, mids, and punchy bass, and isolated sound very well) for only around $30. Instead of just buying my trusty sony's again (I used them heavily and bought a new pair every year), I thought that I would try something different, something more expensive that would produce higher quality sound and last longer than my Sony's usually did (about a year of VERY heavy use).

I spent hours researching different headphones that did the same thing my Sony's did, but better. I wanted to stay below $100 because these are earphones, the quality can only go so high with the limited space for drivers, so any in-ear headphone more than $100 really just becomes a pole measuring contest. I came across the Shure SE215 after reading several reviews and top 10 lists for earphones. People raved about these earphones and claimed that they were the best sub $100 earphones available. Sadly, after several months of use, I am glad to say that I lost these and will be purchasing a different brand for a cheaper price, with better comfort, and the same, if not better, sound quality.

COMFORT: 4/10
Initially, after finding the most comfortable earbud (the included foam), I thought that I had made a great decision in purchasing these. But, after about 24 hours of using them on the bus, walking to and from classes, and then sleeping in them, I found them to be uncomfortable. I could not go more than an hour before I had to take them out because they made my ears hurt. I never experienced this with my Sony's and I was very disappointed.

I have small ears, so the earphones just barely fit and they protruded, so they were clearly visible to other people, and resembled very large hearing aids from the 90's. They often slid out of my ear as the very thick memory wire would not stay behind my ears. Since the cord is so heavy, when the memory wire slid from behind my ears the earphones would completely fall out.

DESIGN: 4/10
These headphones are not designed for people with small ears. The earbud itself just barely fit into my ear and would become extremely uncomfortable after only about 30 minutes of use. This greatly effected the ""sound isolation"" feature because a tight seal is needed, and with the earphones constantly popping out of my ears, a seal was never constant.

Moving on to the cord that comes with these earphones. They are easily the worst and most difficult earphone cables that I have ever dealt with. For it to be a cable to a set of earphones, it is extremely thick and heavy. They tangle EVERY single time I put them in the carrying case, in my pocket, pretty much any time that they are not in use. The worst part about that is that they are HARD to untangle. I think this is because of the memory wire/cord that is at the top of the cable. After you mold them to a comfortable fit around your ears (I never achieved this, cord was too stiff and never held the same shape) they essentially become hooks and tangle the cords making the untangling process lengthy and VERY inconvenient.

With my old Sony earphones, I was able to pull them out of my pocket and have them in my ears, and plugged into my phone in 10 seconds or less. With the Shure SE215, it takes me almost 1 minute to complete the same task.

The cord itself is the reason I am glad to be purchasing a different pair of earphones. It is easily the most difficult cable I have ever dealt with on any audio device. It's so thick and heavy, that when you have the headphones in your ears, you can hear every single move that the cord makes. This is terrible if you are walking or jogging, because the cord will be bouncing off of your body, you'll hear a very audible thud with each bounce.

SOUND QUALITY: (8/10 With great seal, 3/10 with decent seal)
The reviews I read praised the sound quality in these earphones, so I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that they sound similar and sometimes worse than my $30 Sony earphones. The thing with these earphones, is that sound quality is extremely dependent upon how good of a seal that you have between your ear canal and the earbuds. The few times I was able to create a great seal, the sound was on par with my $30 Sony earphones. Balanced Hi-mid range, punchy but stable bass, and a very nice amount of clarity. When there isn't a great seal with these headphones, the bass completely disappears, and the overall sound becomes very tin-like, thin with no noticeable range.

Overall, I would not recommend these earphones to anyone, especially not to people with small ears. The over the ear design is uncomfortable, the sound quality depends on how deep you can fit these into your ear canal, and ultimately they are just frustrating and uncomfortable because of the cable that comes with them. If you look around, you can find headphones that are more comfortable, and have equal to or better sound quality for more than half the price of these.

Sidenote: I had a red winter coat, and with the cord constantly rubbing against it, it eventually took on a dingy red color."

I have been extremely pleased with both the sound and build quality, they block out almost all of the external noise, and the highs sound great, and the lows are nicely balanced (no more stupid skullcandy too much bass issue for me)"

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"seriously unimpressive. Firstly the play/stop music function no longer works as with the ""hold"" to advance song tracks. They worked for about 3 weeks then just don't work anymore. I checked my phone if I somehow disconnected them from ""media"" control but i did not. The only functions that work now is the volume control and turning them off.

Second 'hot mess' is the microphone/phone call quality. Piss poor no matter if you are on 4g or wifi, phone calls or ""internet calls like Skype / LINE""...all bad quality sound.

Thirdly the wire is just too long. Just looks dumb hanging so low behind your neck. You can 'loop' them as they have a thingy to clap the wire but then you are still stuck with a huge ""loop"" bouncing on the back of your neck.

Some nitpicking...the voice that tells you when you 'turned it on' and the battery life left....is very very loud. Just doesn't make sense to have it that loud.

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality and very comfortable after you get used to wearing them. Noise isolation is much better than I expected.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for my SE-530 which were stolen at an airport. The sound is very good; not equivalent to the 530's but very good. I am very satisfied with the sound quality for this price point.
However, I often find that I choose not to use them because it is such a battle to put them on. They have a junction between the earbud and the cable that is designed to allow the wire to rotate for a comfortable fit. But this junction is flimsy, so 50% of the time the function disconnects. This requires removing the earbud from your ear and starting the process all over again.
I prefer the sound from these, but I find myself grabbing my $15 Panasonic bud because I can just put them in and listen rather than going through a 10 minute ordeal of multiple attempts to insert the Shure's and keep the wire connected.
My 530's also had a junction in the same place, but they didn't fall apart. Apparently one of the ways that Shure saved money was to make the materials used for the junction thinner and cheaper."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice if you are looking for good bang/buck ratio. Structure allows bigger capsule enabling sound quality that beats any small-format plugs hands down. Foam plugs offer excellent background noise insulation for motorcycle use and profile is low enough so that these will sit comfortably even under full face helmet. Cables break in surprisingly fast to fit around your ears.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are literally the best headphones I've owned I have some beats by Dre pro studio headphones but nothing compare to these I am a musician and I played at a big festival and could not hear anything but the tracks playing in my ears. Just to test out how good they block sound while they had music playing before the show started I stood by the speakers with the head phones in and played music from my iPad and all I heard was the music from the iPad playing they are great the best money can by......!!!!!!!!!
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love how they sit flush with my ear and I can use them in bed with out driving the speaker into my eardrum. I agree with other reviewers that the sound cancellation may be too good. By the time I here my wife yelling my name she is already upset.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,great quality. amazing durability. good sound. not too much bass for my preference and i do not listen to bass heavy music. the over ear design was odd at first but i do like it now that im used to it. Very good for noise isolation. only complaint is that the chord is a bit long for me. im pretty short however and it is only a minor nuisance so 5 stars anyways.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used them for recording and they work great for a nice balance of your drums and the click track. Used them with rehearsing live and was getting too much noise from the guitars and bass so I couldn't hear the click track very well. Again these are perfect for recording drums but not good for all the extra noise that comes from the guitars and bass in rehearsing situations.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. High quality, stay in my ears, excellent bass response while I play bass live."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for the price
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome for the musician who wants to give in-ears a shot. They're loud, they isolate well, and they fit pretty nice. The pack of buds offer rubber fittings in 3 sizes and foam plugs in 3 sizes. if you like to use the ""ear-plug"" style, i suggest ordering more tips. they can be had for around $15 for 5 more pairs.

these are also great for just listening to music on."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased about two months ago, I just occasionally used it but already the cable broke down and the right-side is not working. In contrast, I've used Etymotic ER-4P for three years and had no problem until it finally died away a few months ago even though I used it constantly.

The replacement cable is quite expensive and I don't want to spend more money within just a couple of months after making a purchase; hope that this is covered under warranty but the procedure looks very inconvenient plus time and money consuming... Honestly I am quite frustrated and regret my decision trying Shure product instead of one from Etymotic."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound amazing takes a little while to put but they don't fall off. & customer service is amazing!
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is about my third pair of specialized earphones, and these are the best. I have a small head and the around-the-head style earphones are just too bulky to be comfortable for me. I initially had trouble fitting them around my ear properly, but once I got them on right they fit perfectly. They are the most comfortable earphones I've owned. They also block out most outside noise. And, the sound quality is great."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does not fit as snug as my SE110 which blocked out the whole world once inserted but these SE210 do a great job.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fantastic sound isolating in ear monitors. Great for when you want the outside world to just stay out
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sounding, best noise cancellation, most comfortable earbuds on the market period. They sound so rich and full when properly placed in the ear. I've been through every brand except Bose and nothing compares."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome headphones, really full sound and the bass is surprisingly good. They do a great job of blocking out external sound which is nice, and the low profile means I can fall asleep with them on without it hurting our bothering me."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's slightly ugly and the fit takes some getting used to (especially putting them on). But the sound quality is one of the best I've heard especially given the $99 price point.

It's great value"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds themselves work great, however, if I don't position the wires just right the sound doesn't come through. Considering the price, everything should work great. Not just one part."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing good about this Bluetooth adapter. I have no idea why Shure put their name on it.

They hiccup. They sound terrible for anything but voice. The max volume is inconsistent from moment to moment. The charge port is difficult to open and the cover doesn’t swing out of the way entirely so it will undoubtedly wear out. The battery is so tiny you are not sure there is one the first time you pick them up.

And the play next and play previous function? Hold the volume up or volume down button for three seconds. So to skip 3 tracks takes ten seconds.

What’s most frustrating is that there’s another company that makes a highly reviewed alternative for the same price."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a nice design, they are very harsh in the 6-8KHZ frequencies, limiting the volume. the bass is good, I'm not much of a 'Bass Head', but with these its not overpowering. To me, they are quite uncomfortable, i have small ears. So that may be a problem for just me. Worth a look, personal opinion."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily that best head phones that i have ever had, i got these to replace my beats audio which gave out on me. super comfortable, if you are the bubble of getting a pair, go for it, you will not regret."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great earphones, I just couldn't get used to the behind the ear types. I was paranoid that it would fall out."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Connector too short for iPad Air with cover on. Over ear design difficult to wear. Ear pieces just OK., none stay put in my ears therefore sound isolation is not as expected."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair has amazing sound quality. The bass is still there, but not as pronounced as a speaker. You'll hear it, but not feel it."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the shape, color and strong wire. The rub makes me a little uncomfortable but it really does a good job in sound isolation.

As for the acoustical quality, it does not give me much surprise than my old cheaper Sennheiser."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for the money. Only complaint is that you have to wrap around the top of your ear, so using for jogging is a pain, as the cord is a little stiff and so they don't stay in that well. But otherwise awesome value."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were totally worth my money. They had everything I needed and more, as is beautifully illustrated by other reviews. But one thing: you may notice that the sound is a bit flat at first. If that is true, switch the default foam caps to the plastic ones. It dramatically increased the note range, resonance, and clarity for me."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my first dive into the world of hifi audio and I am not looking back. The IEMs are somewhat tough at first to get into your ear but once you get it down it is easy and quick. They sound amazing and are not uncomfortable at all. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for IEMs in this price range.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,needs some time to get used to. also a little too much bass
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my step-son for Christmas and he loves them. He is thrilled with the sound quality.

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. Snug fit ensures clear, rich, and uninterrupted sound from external noise (great for music and even the Indy 500). Sound is detailed, plenty of low rich bass, and terrific for Classical as well as pop/rock. Took a while to figure out how they fit into the ear, but now they're easy."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love how these headphones sound but after 3 years of using them I am fed up. I have got them replaced 3 times in 2 years. Every single time one or the other sides stops working. Shure customer services promptly replaces them as long as they are under warranty. But now my warranty has run out and am not going to be buying another pair of Shure's again. Still trying figure what brand I should go with.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,What? i can heard what you are saying because i have my SOUND ISOLATING earphones on. love them
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great sounding earbuds and when placed properly in the ear they eliminate a lot of noise. My only complaint is that I have trouble getting the wires to dress the way I would like them to go.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in ear headphones ever. This is my second set; only bought new ones because first ones were stolen after 4 yrs of use.REPAIR PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, I never needed them after 6 yrs of total use though."

Takes some time and practice to put on, but once they are in there, the sound is great and they are very comfortable and secure in the ear canal. Comparing to Klipsch S4 which are also very good but getting old and fray, these are better in the bass and treble ranges.

Highly recommended"

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of earphones with quality sound and performance. They sit pretty comfortable on ears and can be used for long duration.

My gripe is however, with the cable itself, the detachable piece-of-s*** barely lasted for 2 months and then the replacement lasted 11 months. All the good quality of the earphones is being undone by an simple audio cable.

I actually bought these earphones especially for the ease of replacing the audio cables. My older Bose earphones didn't had replaceable cable so they lasted as long as the cable which on average 2 years. But the cables on SE215 are barely lasting 7 months on average. Most of the people are complaining about the low quality of the audio cables from Shure."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are really well made, the cables look really sturdy etc. The one thing I don't love is the monitor v. regular headphone fit. Would have gotten non-monitor headphones if I had to do it all over again."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound awesome. Especially if you know how to use an equalizer.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you take the time to fit these properly the sound is fantastic rivaling my high end headphones. I am very impressed.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Someday I'll be able to afford the SE535's but these are fine for every day commuting. The foam tips that Shure provides do a great job on the subway. I don't listen to bass heavy music so the flat response is perfect for classical, experimental, and other full range music. I use Poweramp on an Android so I can boost bass when I want and they sound great. The equalizer lets me fine tune all frequencies and bass is fine when I push that. Rolling Stones,Amon Tobin, or Juno Reactor sound fantastic when you set frequencies correctly. What is amazing about these earphones is the detail of the music that is completely missing from so many other brands like Beats or Logitech. It's a different listening experience.

The flexible plastic that are bent to go around your ears doesn't stay in a consistent shape. I find myself bending it into a loop each time I put these on. It's not a big deal but makes it hard to use them several times a day. I use the foam tips mostly to reduce noise from the NYC subway and if they're inserted correctly, it's amazing how you aren't assaulted with noise from passing trains. I've noticed a big difference in tinnitus after using these.

I've read that in-ear earphones can be more damaging to hearing that on-ear headphones but I'd rather carry around 2 oz than a bulky 10oz set. I don't listen at high volume and I'm careful about high dynamic range music."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic sound quality. Unfortunately they aren't as comfortable as other headphones I've used. It really depends on the shape of your ears
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound, it's just missing a little bit of bass even when you are totally covered with the Earphones,
I gave four stars because the isolation isn't perfect it can be such as 2/3, what's pretty good...
the earphone's cables seems to be robust...

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in ears ive ever used. Love them.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just got these today so i am still exploring, but first impressions are GREAT! i've had a couple other sets of noise-isolating earphones before but these WAY outperform the others, both in noise-blocking and in sound quality. (most recently i had a klipsch set with comply foam tips for extra noise reduction.)

the SE215s come with several different sizes of foam ear buds so you can find the perfect fit. bonus feature to that is the fact that the units swivel on the cable. so far, for me that means they seem much less likely to yank out of the ear. (used to happen to me a lot, hasn't once yet...)

sound is crystal clear and balanced. (i use the 'bass booster' setting on my ipod, for whatever little bit that does. next i'll be adding an alpen DAC headphone amp once it arrives in the mail.) and i commute on the NYC subway, which is loud as hell from screeching turns/breaks and rattling metal to loud-talkers and generally large amounts of white noise. but today i listened to music i could NEVER enjoy before and the environment faded right out. in fact, there's enough reduction that i might advise people who'd be in danger if they couldn't hear something of their surroundings to get a different product.

another nice feature is that the units are detachable so that if your cable bends/breaks, you don't have to throw out the whole set. just order a (cheap) new cable, swap, and off you go! this was a selling point for me, along with the strong reviews, as the last two sets i've had both went bad where the cable enters the earpiece.

one feature that's not a negative, yet, but might get tedious: the cable is rather long, so from ears to unit-in-pocket there's a lot of slack. maybe enough to get annoying/caught on stuff or tangled. maybe not, we'll see...but it's definitely longer than the other sets i've had. for whatever that's worth...

another possible drawback is that the cable is just the 'raw' wire with a very thin clear coating. this seems to increase the sound-in-ear of the cable rubbing on clothing, etc. (the klipsch come with a cable coated in special ""no tangle' rubber that was a lot quieter against fabrics when the cable moved around.) so far this isn't a disaster--and the 'naked' style of the cable looks cool--but it proves to be the only negative i can find so far. certainly not enough to make me wish i'd chosen another product!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product great service
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable after a few weeks. took me a little bit to get used to them but they are great other than that.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these last February and by July I had to replace the cable cord, after replacing the cord a month later the right headphone gave up. The sound is good for the price but sadly the quality doesn't last."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(that I've tried)

I mostly listen to full sized phones but wanted a pair of IEMs for working out and for days when i don't want to lug my ah-d2000's to work.

I started out with the thinksound ts01. It had amazing spacial details but was all bass, few mids and hardly any treble. (costs less than se215)

Next i tried the Sennheiser ie6 (costs more than the se215)they had the mids that i missed in the thinksounds but were veiled from the mids onward.

After the Senn's broke I switched to these, priced between the aforementioned models i found the to have the most balanced sound signature. They don't really play up into the highest treble regions, but they do have better treble than the previously mentioned phones. The mids are the real star of the show on these phones, but the bass is HUGE when the seal is right. These phones literally have some of the best bass ive encountered. huge and full while maintaining punch and clarity. they lack the depth of the senns or thinksounds but they have much better balance. They dont come close to my ah-d2000's in depth or clarity but those are full sized cans at 3 times the price so its not a fair comparison. I do prefer them to my 7506's though.

Being as the sound tube goes kind-of far into the ear, im not sure id want more treble anyway, any sibilance is bad sibilance in that sort of situation.

The isolation on these things is crazy good, and could be dangerous in the right circumstance (jogging by a busy road would be out of the question). outside noise can barely get in, with music at even low volume you cant hear a thing."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I ordered. Sound is great. Only drawback is that it takes a bit of time to figure out how to wear them. I use them to run in. They work great. the cord is a little long, but I just tuck it into my shorts."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way these headphones fit. I can bike, run with no problems. Also these headphones perfect for subway commute as they block all noise. I would not recommend using them while biking in the city or any area that you may need to listen out for your surroundings. Bass quality is great on trance and rap tracks; however, it can be distorted when I listed to Rammstein."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these earphones for about a month now. I don't know if I would consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy my music when it sounds good. When my old pair of Sony earbuds fell apart, I decided it was time to step up to an entirely new level of earbud sophistication. After some research, I decided on the Shure SE215, which had received many favorable reviews. Plus, at roughly $100, the price was reasonable compared to other kinds of headphones out on the market.

Ultimately, the Shure SE215s are the best sounding in-ear headphones I have ever heard. There were, however, a few initial problems with these earphones. This next portion of the review is going to sound overwhelmingly negative, but bear with me!

The first problem I had with these earphones came down to comfort. For the first week or two of ownership, the SE215 is a difficult headphone to wear comfortably, and finding an easy way to wear them is a long and awkward process. The SE215 is shaped quite differently than any other earphone I have owned, and therefore resulted in some unique kinds of ear pain and fatigue from even the briefest periods of use. The cable on the SE215 is designed to curve up and over the ear, which was once again completely different from any other earphone I have used. Problem is, the cable is quite rigid and will not curve around the ear easily. In fact, it took me a good three hours before I had found a way to keep the earphones in my ears without the cable falling off and bumping into my cheek, which was annoying. Then, after I found a way to keep the earphones in my ears, the next issue presented itself. They sounded terrible, alternating between a slightly ""tinny"" sound with no bass and having the right earphone muted in comparison to the left earphone. This was confusing, because the SE215 was supposedly the best sounding earphone in the world for the price.

Now, any sane person would be asking themselves why I gave these earphones a perfect 5/5 if I had such a rough time with them. Rest assured, there is a light at the end of this tunnel. Allow me to explain.

The ear pain and fatigue is common with any new kind of earphone. As mentioned before, I have owned Sony earphones over the years. I remember each one of those headphones bothering my ears for the first few weeks of ownership. Eventually, your ears just get used to the new earphones, which leads to lessened pain and fatigue. After a month or so of regularly listening to them, the SE215 no longer fatigues my ears. They are actually rather comfortable. The cable has also limbered up a bit, making it easier to fold up and around my ears than before.

But the biggest improvements have to be attributed to the foam ""sleeves"" included with the SE215. These headphones come out of the box with six pairs of interchangeable ""sleeves,"" which are the parts of the earphone you insert into your ear. Three pairs are rubber, and three pairs are made of a fragile foam. Having no experience with foam sleeves, I immediately attempted the rubber sleeves. I am not too sure why these earphones come with rubber sleeves, because they are largely useless. The rubber sleeves refused to stay in my ears and made the earphones sound awful. So I moved on to the foam sleeves, which were a revelation. Not only are they very comfortable, but the foam sleeve really allow the Shure SE215s to work their magic. In order to work properly, the instructions state that the earphones must have a good seal against the outside world. The foam sleeves provide that seal, leading to a sound experience that rivals even the audiophile-spec Sennheiser HD 595s I use for serious stereo listening. The foam sleeves are fragile, though, so handle and replace them with care.

The Shure SE215 really is a fine piece of audio equipment. They sound phenomenal, easily matching much more expensive headphones and outclassing everything I have tried up to this point in my life. There are some initial problems, but these problems will either go away over time or can be erased entirely by using the foam sleeves. I would not use them for exercise, but that's what a cheap pair of earbuds are for. I highly recommend the Shure SE215 to anyone wanting an amazing earphone."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used the SE425 at a larger venue and they were awesome. Of course I couldn't afford those at the I ordered the SE215-CL, but for the money I can't beat them. I am well pleased. Shure you're the bomb! Thank you!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earbuds I've ever had. When i received them i dropped everything i was doing to open and use them. Bending the wire behind your ear is a bit tricky and took about 2 minutes when I first opened them but now it takes me about 2 seconds. I plugged them in my phone and turned it to max volume and closed my eyes and I was transported to a magical place, I would compare it to the scene in Ratatouille where the mouse eats the cheese and he trips out on them, it was like that but music. It comes with several different buds 3 sizes of foam and rubber 6 total pairs and a tool for cleaning the wax and taking the buds off (I think that's what i use it for I don't know what else it could be) the wire is very sturdy and the plastic is clear so you can see the silver and bronze wires inside it as well as the internals of the bud itself. They are the best noise cancelling earbuds I've ever had, they tune out noisy high schoolers and anything else you could think of. The sound is unlike anything I've ever heard. I love being able to feel the vibrations in my ears from my obnoxiously loud music. Overall, these were one of the most worth it products I've ever purchased and would recommend it to everyone."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for this price. A wide scene. Very detailed sound and vocals. The deep bass. The treble is a little small. In general, a good product from Shure.I am pleased, I recommend."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounded really good until they broke 9 months in. The ear bud snapped clean off while it was in my ear, very bizarre. I'm considering it to be a fluke and will re buy due to how much I enjoyed them prior."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall reasonably good sound and they appear to be sturdily built. However the bass, touted in the promo blurb, is really not all that good, And, I do use the expandable ear buds. I have less expensive earphones with as good or better bass response."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"favorite IEMs for the price range, great warm sound, and super comfortable with the foam tips"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones every day while using shared transportation. I appreciate them because they block out the noise of other people talking and any other annoyances. They isolate to the extent that you might not hear the person in the next room calling you. Expect to replace the foam tips after less than a year, but the price is reasonable.

Having come from earbuds where the cable doesn't go over your ear, I was somewhat worried about comfort, but these are comfortable enough that you can sleep with them on. They cable is well made and has lasted over 6 months without issues, and won't end the life of the headphones if it breaks.

Audio quality is warm, as the charts show. I recommend EQing the treble up somewhat if you like a more balanced sound, as I mainly purchased these for isolation. After EQing, these are well worth the price when it comes to audio quality."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap price for such amazing quality. I have Bose IE2 and the wire broke. Bose said I can purchase a new set at a discounted set for $70. I no and I ended up with the Shure. Best decisions on in-ear headphones I made. They fit great and does not come loose a d they also sound amazing. The Sure has a more ""life"" feel to it then the Bose where it has a ""flat"" feel to it. I also use the Comply foam so sound isolation is really good. Better then the Bose IE2.
I won't even compare them to Beats because its not even fair for Beats. Comparing Shure to Beats is like comparing a finely tuned supercar (Shure) to a turbocharged Civic (Beats).

The SE315 was another one I was looking at but I go though headphones quite easily just due to all the travel I do and the amount of usage I use them for, $200 was a bit much for me to spend but the SE215 was in my budget and they are amazing. The fit does take a little getting used too but not too bad."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality
Since the moment you hear decent music with the SE215 you notice an amazing quality, crystal clear, sharp, deep bass but not too much, and perfect balance across all music genres, I've tested it a lot with FLACs, Audio CDs and good quality MP3s and the sound quality is amazing.

Sound isolation is very very good, I will not use it for outdoor sports, nor walking on the streets, sound isolation is really that good.

Build
Is feels strongly build, and even though I've just had it for about a month, it feels is durable and will last several years.

Fit
This is why i'm not giving it 5 stars. My ears gets tired after long use, just putting them on is not simple and are not that comfortable. One point in their favor is that I can see myself walking, jumping, moving a lot and the earbuds staying right where they are supposed to be.

To summarize it, I'm quite happy with my SE215s and I would recommend it very much. I'm an audiophile and love music and this is quite a return for my money, as sound quality is awesome."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these back in 2011 as emergency/backup in-ear monitors but have also used them when I run and workout at the hotel. These have lasted quite a while and sound great... heavier bass/mids are to be expected with the number/quality of drivers that Shure puts into these suckers... that's just what you get-- not a huge deal.

What does start to be a huge deal is the cables-- I hate, hate hate the swivel ""feature"" of the cable. Anyone can tell you, and I'll attest that, that these cables are terrible and will fail eventually. I tried contact cleaner, rubbing alcohol, etc and did due-diligence cleaning these. Still, the cable has given up the ghost and I've had to purchase another. Considering I've gotten five years out of them (I've gone through two sets molded ears during this time) I'm pleased with the quality and sound."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: I've owned variety of earphones from different brands over the years ranging from Sony, Skullcandy, to Bose. The shure by far has the best sound quality out of all the pairs I've owned. The bass is punchy but not overpowering and the highs are clear. The mids blends in well in between. The build quality of the earphones is good, very sturdy. It is very comfortable to wear and fits very snug and gives excellent isolation. I travel by subway everyday and these help create my own world amidst the hecticness of the loud background noises.

Con: Now I will say something about the cables. I maybe be of good quality but it is way too long. Many like their cables long but these are unnecessarily long. The ipod and/or the phone sits insides the pant pocket that's less that 1 meter from the ears. It does not need to be so long that there are excess amount of wires hanging outside of the pocket. As mentioned above, I travel on the crowded subway everyday with lots of people and the extra hanging wires would be a hazard as it can get damaged when it gets caught on other people's cloths or bags. Other than that it's a great pair of earphones."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent earphones. These are wonderful sounding and do an excellent job of blocking external noise as well. I bought these to be my sweat resistant monitors. I use them for workouts and for yard work. They drown out bad people at the gym and almost completely block my lawn mower. The cords are a bit stiff, but that does not warrant a negative in my mind. The only con I would give is that I am a bit on the tall side, so I could not wear my device on my hip or in a lower pocket. Easy recommend in my book."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I should start off by saying that I am not an expert on headphones, and don't have any data to back up my opinions, but I have owned quite a few pairs of headphones/IEM's over time (enough for my family to make fun of me.) The other headphones most recently in my rotation are Bose Sie2 for working out, Bose AE2, and Audio Technica ATH-M50. The Bose AE2 are supremely comfortable, but just don't sound that great. The Bose Sie2 are great for working out in that the cord is so conveniently short, and they stay in regardless of the rigor of your activity. And the M50's sound better than any other headphones I've ever owned, with their highly accurate sound that lets you hear everything in the recording. So where do the SE215 fit in?

In my use the answer is every time except when I'm working out or sitting at my home desk and in the mood for high accuracy. I find myself reaching for these IEM's constantly. They are comfortable and easy to put in your ears, and they sound great. And I'm saying that as someone who appreciates M50s for their accuracy. These IEMs are certainly more exaggerated in the low end, but I find that to be necessary for IEMs considering the environments I use them in, plus it's just fun to listen to.

They also block an incredible amount of sound, so that I feel that I have no need for big sound-cancelling headphones, and I can easily tune out or even not hear noisy environments around me. They come with a nice carrying case that is easy to get the IEM in and out of. This once again makes them great for carrying everywhere. And finally they are very discreet, especially in the clear color, which can sometimes be convenient."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 9 July 2014:
I have had no end of problems with the left ear bud cutting out. A little wiggling and it would work, but it would cut out again shortly after. I thought it was the end of the ear bug pushing against my ear canal, sealing the end, but it was not. It ended up being a poorly fitting connector on the ear bud. I took a very small screwdriver and bend the center pin just a tiny bit and it now they don't cut out anymore.

After living with these things for three months (I wear them 1/2 hour a day, at least), I am no more excited about them. I have managed to bend the wire near the ear bud to get them stay in better, but I find the wire will flip around (off of my ear), making them want to come out again.

I also used a paint pen to paint a red stripe on the right ear bud so I can tell which is which. Shure should have done something like this from the factory. The tiny red dot they put on there is difficult to see, especially when light is poor.

The rotation of the ear bud makes a big difference is fit. Unfortunately, rotating the ear bud changes where the cord exits, and affects the fit, so some wire bending and trial and error is required to get the fit right if I rotate them. While these ear buds can be made to fit OK, it ends up being a project, and I don't want a project to wear ear buds. I have never had so much problems with ear bud fit before.

It's really too bad, as the basic concept of a good sounding, passively sound isolating ear bud is a great idea. I use them when in the garage -- they double as a music source and hear protection in one. It's an idea that worked very well in their previous versions.

Original review:

This is my fourth set of Shure sound isolating headphones. They have historically died by the insulation cracking after a year of two. I was excited to see that they updated their design - removable cables and the extra layer of insulation around the ear gave me hope that they would last longer.

What I did not expect was that they fit has changed drastically. I have worn the previous generation for countless many hour stretches when working. I've worn them on many 12+ hour plane rides. I have never had any significant complaints about the fit for the previous generation models. This generation is completely different and don't fit me well at all. The right ear manages to stay in, but the left doesn't. There is a lot more bulk of rigid plastic to this model and if they don't fit your ear, too bad, they will fall out. I understand that everyone's ears are different, but dealing with that is the name of the game when making headphones.

On top of that, the extra insulation around the ear makes the cord very stiff, which makes them more prone to falling out. I was looking forward to the extra insulation, thinking it would help longevity, but if they fall out all the time, then it won't matter.

I suppose these will be my last Shure product."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality. Very happy with the range. A little tough to get the fit right, but once you do you'll be very satisfied.
The cords are thick and beefy. I like that because they don't bang around and give me artificial sounds. They feel like they'll survive longer than a few months.
Pretty decent sound isolation. I use them mostly while traveling to drown out the noise of my fellow passengers. Work like a charm.
I've tried them while walking the dog and won't dot hat again. Too efficient at isolating the noise. Couldn't hear the ambient noise well enough to feel safe. I have a different headset for that anyway so I'm concerned. Just wanted to try them out.

I'm not an audiophile, but I was impressed with the range. Sounds aren't muddy but there is ample bass. Clear midtones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always had a difficult time with earbuds breaking. It didn't seem to depend what brand or style I got, beats, skullcandy, random brands, they all performed the same; breaking after a few weeks or months or in the case of the beats 3 uses... I am not hard on headphones, in fact I treat them reverently and have many audiophile quality over the ear headphones that I love including Martin Logan, Bowers and Wilkins, and Senheisser. But for some reason beyond my understanding, earbuds tend to fall apart at my merest touch. Not the case with Shure. They are perfect (once you figure out how to put them on, which for some people takes a while to figure out), with amazing build quality, durability, and sound production. You may hesitate at the price tag, but to think of how many pairs of useless headphones you could go through and how much money wasted, it is a no-brainer. Go with these and stop wasting your hard earned money on garbage."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not a audiophile, so I wont say much about the sound quality. The vocal is pretty clean. The build quality is really excellent. Its comfortable, but the stock ear tips are not really good for long hour use. (I'd suggest getting the comply foam tips)"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality and fitment were fine, the cable broke within 6 weeks of usage."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound was great. Did not last 6 months.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits perfect, great sound for the cost. I use them to play live, totally isolates the sound. Long chord, useful for playing at home connected to my Line6 floor POD."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound in as advertised--balanced, nice bass, great definition of all instruments, no complaint there. But, they are a bugger to get fit into the ear correctly and then move the cord over the ear easily. Once the wrangling of the cord is done, they are fine. If you are planning on using these a lot to work out with, as I do, be prepared for some issues with how the cord hangs and cups or forms behind your ear. Otherwise, for any other activity, sweet headphones."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality when listening to voices. Eliminates pretty much all external noise. A little awkward with the over-the-ear cord, but overall not an issue. Ear buds are very comfortable and can be worn for many hours."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"By far the best pair of IEM's I've ever owned. I've been through Bose IEM's and Klipsch X10's and these are by far superior and are only $99 right now. Buy them, you will not be disappointed. The bass is incredibly rich sounding, I'm no audiophile but I love great pairs of headphones. I was hesitant about the cable being placed over the ears however they feel great and the cords do not brush against your cheeks like other head phones."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great isolation. Great cord. Bass does bleed through the mids a bit. Use an amp with a. Eq and it can be cleaned up. But a well built set if iems with good low end.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceeded my expectations and more comfortable than my other sets of in ear headphones. Deep but realistic sound.

Be sure to follow instructions on wearing earphones carefully."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 11 pair and 4 didn't work right and 1 has since quit working. This is a lot of money for earbuds that are not going to last.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality in this headphones is (Ok) i don't like the bass at all it makes them sound a little muffled. And the peace of plastic that goes around your ear it's uncomfortable....
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I own!
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,In less than a year the sound in the right earphone is barely audible. For the money I thought these earphones would be better quality.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, great sound isolation & perfect for iem"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! durability is questionable, both the left and right channel went out on me."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great but the problem is the cables are too stiff, sure I can replace them but that's an addition cost. It's difficult keeping them in place, keep falling off. Gonna keep looking for the right pair that sound good and will stay in place. I want to hear music not spend my time keeping them in place."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had an issue with the cable breaking about 3 months into my usage. It wasn't really a problem since I didn't use that one anyways. They sound very good to me and I was pleased with the price to performance on this.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of the best sounding dynamic single driver headphones around, these are worth every penny and sound better than monitors I've tried with multiple driver layouts... The low is full and open the midrange is present and clear and the high end is smooth, maybe a bit attenuated but still clear... they are not trebly. I really like the frequency response of these, mostly flat with just a little high end roll off in the ""tinny"" frequencies that will not matter to you at all.

Build quality is great. I've had a pair of these for over a year, I feel like they just sound better and better the more you use them. Sadly I lost them recently, I think I was digging in my pocket for something and just didn't realize when they fell. I Immediately bought a new pair...

They do require a little break in, after leaving them on at mid to mid-high volume for 12 HRS the low end and low-mid frequency response filled in quite nicely.

I love the long cable it comes with, and it prevents tangling, also when you're walking around a lot with a coat on it makes it easier to put the cable under your coat (especially longer coats on men) and take your media device out of your pocket without any pulling or having to adjust something down by your pocket. You can bring you device up to chest level easily without pulling out your earphone... definite plus.

Again on the cable, these do not come with a mic cable but you can get one separately. Highly recommend these, especially if you're a music junkie or musician. If you're going to use them as stage monitors check you're impedance and you might want an EQ especially if you're a singer."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, but are challenging to fit into my ear correctly."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looked at so many headphones, even the bose noise cancelling headphones and earphones. Honestly, the 215s are not noise cancelling but with music on, YOU CANNOT HEAR ANYTHING BUT YOUR MUSIC. It does a great job at giving you a great music experience. The 215s are lasting, durable, great sound highs and lows, and they are cheap compared to bose."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these earphones. I sleep with earphones every night. I prefer ones with memory foam since they are, in my opinion, more comfortable. I had been buying inexpensive ones and they were becoming harder to find and broke easily. I would end up buying new ones approx once per month. The SE-215-K have been great. Because of the low profile design, the part that rests on the outside of your ear does not push into the side of my head when I'm sleeping. They block out more so therefore I can keep the music I'm listening to at a lower volume. I love the fact that they come with multiple size buds in both foam and their ""soft flex"". The fact that you can also change out/replace the cable was the main reason I decided to try these, since that is the part of the previous earphones that have failed for me in the past. I've been using the SE-215-Ks now for four months and have had absolutely no problems with them and and extremely pleased! I was hesitant to spend the money on earphones, but decided since it's something I do use every day it was worth the investment. In another two months time I would have spent the same about for cheaper ones that I would need to keep replacing. These, I will have for a long time."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in April 2015. Used it sporadically, today the right earbud is intermittently working, looks like the cable connection to the earbud does not make a solid connection anymore. Regular usage, I did not snug, tagged or pulled on the cable. Just poor design. Just looked at other 'one-star' comments and I see others had same issue. With so many positive comments I was thinking they've worked out the issue. The warranty expired on May 23... Don't recommend!

Updated 24 Septermber 2015:

Every weekend, I play in venues that require in ear monitors. And when I'm not rehearsing or performing, I use them while I practice so as to keep the wife off my back....""It's too loud""....blah blah blah. :-) I'm just a lead guitar player and I don't sing, so I do not need a custom set of IEMs or one's with more than a single driver.

The only thing I do not like is that I have to replace the foam tips often because they wear out. I recommend picking up some of these, in your appropriate size: Comply Premium Replacement Foam Earphone Earbud Tips - Professional P-Series (Medium, Black, 3-pair)

Overall, the quality is good enough (for me) to use as a professional yet cheap enough to replace if they ever get lost or stop working. 5 stars!"

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang-for-buck. The different tips and case are great.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone who typically has issues with the fit of in ear headphones, Shure has been the best for my money yet. I had the older model which fit great and was concerned buying these since they changed the style slightly but was pleasantly surprised. Also, for those not wanting to pay the extra $ for noise cancellation, even playing these at low volumes drowns out almost all background noise."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It comes with a variety of sleeves, I found the large foam ones the most comfortable. It takes a while to get used to putting them on, just know that youll spend 10-15 seconds just fitting them into your ears, but its definitely worth it."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these today and the build quality is great and they sound amazing, the only problem was that I couldn't find a way to wear them without them pressuring my inner ear and causing pain after 30 minutes ish of use. Had to listen with one ear to avoid my ears getting sore. I have used a few other regular types of earbuds (i.e., ones that you aren't meant to wear with the cable behind your ear) with no problem and I don't think my ear canal is irregularly small either. Perhaps I just have to find the right position for it to stop causing so much pressure and stress but it seems like an inevitable problem given how huge the earpiece is. Will give it a week or two to break in and get used to but unless they suddenly stop being uncomfortable I plan to return these. Was really excited too :/"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Shure and after wearing out my last pair, I was excited to get these. The sound is still great, however, it is a pain to get these not only in the ear but to stay in the ear. Not designed well at all. Only 3 stars due to the design and stiffness of the cord."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound amazing battery life.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using these for several hours since they arrived and they sound amazing but these rest on the cartilage of my ears which after about an hour make my ears sore.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound GOOD. My struggle was figuring out how to put them in. There is no clear guidance on that - the diagrams are not big enough to comprehend. Also, if the chord was made formed to bend around the ear, and marked R and L, that would be very helpful. I find that once I bend them, they fight me. I use them for performance, and I think I have to fiddle with them more than I'd like. I do like their durability, and the way they are reinforced at the fork. I like the texture of the chord and the length. I purchased the clear chord, and I like the way it does not call attention to itself. I would recommend that you get the built in mic, as the inserts are noise canceling, so if you're on the stage, you will not hear other non-mic-ed voices. I did not, and I know there are drawbacks to that feature, but they may be worth dealing with."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Shure IE2s are awesome. I tried the Bose IE2 headphones prior to buying this pair. The Bose had lots of bass but seemed to be missing the high and mids. These Shure headphones have both the punchy bass of the IE2s and crisp, bright mids and highs. I had the Shure E2Cs and Bose TriPorts prior to these. The Shure IE2s are quite an upgrade."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't fit great on first try, but changed foam ear pieces to find the ones for my small ear canals. Now they stay in and give me the a great experience paired up with our Avion monitor system. Thanks!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound AMAZING. They're great for when I'm working out, as they don't get in the way because I wear them alongside my back and underneath my shirt. The way they hook around your ears and the rubbery piece to tighten the cord around your head means they don't come out unless you want them to.

My only slightly complaint is I wear glasses sometimes and these are a bit tricky to use with those. The headphone cable either makes my glasses slightly uneven or I can't adjust my glasses if I put the cable on top of the glasses. Minor inconvenience, but it should be noted."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the first time that I put these earbuds on and turned on the Ipod, I was hooked. I have also used them as stage monitors in a band. No complaints, well worth the price."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most of what you hear about these buds is true. They are excellent with all around great sound. A little rolled off at the highs but beautifully warm with big sound. I've had the previous version prior to this and there is a big improvement to the sounds quality. Great choice for the average to discriminating listener.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good quality, sounds amazing, if you use with Fiio E6 or E12 sounds incredible clear and decent quality. Buy one you can't go wrong

Only part which may other new buyers needs to watch out is how the ear pears sits inside your ear some May found. really uncomfortable, but works excellent for me.

Over all I will give 9/10 for this product."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is ok, for the price, quality of material used is good. Difficult to insert compared to my old Shure, and the wire is way too long, uncomfortable to wear overall."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect. Honestly what I was expecting. Isolated any and all sound around me so all I hear is the musicians and my drumming in the in ears. I love them.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After getting used to winding it around your ear, it works great. I am hard of hearing and must wear hearing aids. These allow me to hear the vocal mix from the pa board very clearly."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Blocks out any ambient noise and is crystal clear in the sound. I can only imagine what the next level up must sound like! Overall, a great bargain for what you get."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, and the slightly longer cord really helps onstage."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't like the in-ear headphone before because my ears get itchy after a couple minutes. But this one doesn't. Works great on iPhone 6s, I mainly listen to jazz and balance is great."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,No joke. These are quality headphones.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price you cannot beat it. I bought these earbuds to use when I ride my motorcycle. The negative profile provides ample clearance between my ears and the helmet. I would rate the clarity above average.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely fantastic.
Best in-ear headphones I have ever come across-- great detail in the whole range of frequencies. Fits comfortably and, most importantly, the isolation is superb. This set has better isolation than most studio monitoring headsets I've tried."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves this product. It seems to be worth the price.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these inears! I got them for my inear monitor to use on stage at church and end up using them for everything from flying to listening to my ipod. I think I get a second pair for personal use and one for work.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound is perfect but to handle these things/ getting in and out of our ears is a painindabutt even after 1 year of use

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these over a year ago at this point and have been using them daily. I am very rough with things, and have been impressed with how long these have lasted (most headphones only last me 4-5 months max). Excellent sound quality as well. I couldn't recommend these more."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphone love them
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have a nice even sound. Very well built and durable. I bought them as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using typical skull candy and default apple brand headphones for all of my life, these things were a huge step up. I am very please, the quality is amazing. It is like listening to all of my favorite songs for the first time. It muffles out other sounds extremely well, the fit is great, and the quality is perfect. Users should know that these are bass heavy, so I wouldn't get them if you don't like the enhanced bass. But who doesn't love enhanced bass?"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound no is the best
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - As I've come to expect of all Shure earphones, the sound quality on these babies is excellent. And the noise isolation is as it should be. I'm no audiophile per-se, but I personally can't settle for less than this kind of quality in a set of earphones.

Con's - Compared to the 115's and 210s, the 215's construction is a bit trickier to learn to fit properly. But once you get used to them, you can come to appreciate their ergonomic form."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really good headphones, very comfortable! They block most background noise and have never fallen out for me! The reason I didn't give it five stars is I would prefer a little more bass but overall the sound quality is very clear."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,thanks
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great while they work which was 6-8 months of daily use of 8 hours a day. Can drive them hard till you can feel them shaking in your ears. Right channel dies. Really wish it hadn't cause they are great cost to performance
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and I can hear them on my Harley. Highly recommend.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Shure buds (SE535) with this cable sound better than any other Bluetooth alternative out there. Thanks Shure!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing pretty good so far.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While they sounded great, my daughter used them for iPhone/iPad earbuds. They have not been subjected to the harsh conditions these are known for and does not yank/pull the cable. And the only device has been her iPad as of lately. Well, three weeks ago, they stopped working. Based on the reviews, I bought new cables. No joy... as the earbuds are still not working. For paying nearly $100, I expected more. Sorry, Shure - won't be buying anything more w/ your name on it."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones has lasted me longer than any other set of headset I've used. I used it daily for working out and travel for 3 years. It took a moment getting used to, but I love them! They're a little long, but that allows me to have movement and the phone stored in my pants pocket. no problem.

I seriously I cannot hear anyone or anything unless my ears pick up the noise through my body. Superb sound isolation. I feel isolated and focused.

Sound: great! Even better with the foamies
Design: durable and moldable.
Price: more than willing to pay it. 3 years of a good product

Mine started to cut out... I have been through hell with them, but I think I wore a connector at the joint by smashing them often in a work out routine"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, balanced sound. Six different foam kits are included (three sizes, foam and silicon each). Great build quality. Unfortunately they were not a good fit and the foam plugs did not come off for me. There are instructions out there telling you to put the things in a freezer and stuff, but that was not quite something I was prepared to do"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well first off I am no audiophile so probably couldn't tell teh difference between Mozart and Cher. Well maybe those two but I'm no professional. Saying that I think the sound they produce is pretty good. I also liked my Skull Candy Titans but they seem to keep hiding on me.

Now for the design. Figuring out how to install them took a while. Yes I used the work install instead of put them in because that seems more appropriate. After doing it a couple times though it seems easy enough. I normally just used the regular ones you just push in the ears so the wrapping the cord around the ear part took some trial and error.

In the questions there were some concerns about using them with glasses. While I would think they would be a big problem based on how they fit, they are not. They seem to work just fine with glasses.

Phone cases. This is one area I had a problem. The case on my phone and tablet did cause some issues though. The jack does not fit them. I already had a solution though for my tablet which was a short 3 inch male to male cable with a female to female adapter on the end. Adds some bulk to the cable but otherwise works ok. It would be better if they could redesign the plug to have more clearance.

If the plug was designed better I would probably give them 4.5 stars. If they didnt wrap behind the ears I would give them 5 stars."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To be honest, these are the earphones you can get for the price! Sound quality, Build quality, and packaging is all top notch!
Lets start with the build quailty! When i first recieved the product and realized that the product was made out of plastic, i thought it wasnt going to last however, i have dropped it, i have dropped it in water, it got covered with sweat while exercising and it held up pretty well! I legit abused the product and it held up just fine.
The sound quality is just phenomenal! The bass is deep and not to boomy and not to over the top, the bass it produces is the type of bass that lets you dance. The mids are bright and crisp and emphaize on the vocals of a song which makes makes it feel like a large sound stage. The highs are not as crisp and clear however are decent and dont get in the way!
In conclusion, for a 100$, these are the best pair of earphones you can buy while still looking amazing by showing all of its glory and guts!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE215-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single Dynamic MicroDriver

Excellent! Too well built but break-in quickly. When I first plugged this into my Samsung S6 I was sad with distortion. Also hated the stiffness of the heavy cable. The earbud cable has a bit of memory wire but not too much. Distortion soon disappeared (I guess a little break-in period is always necessary). After 2 days the cables are also loosening up and more flexible. The sound of these DRIVERS are satisfying but EQ is always needed for different ears. I prefer to set my EQ and then lower the EQ PRE Level by half - which seems to make less fatigue and safer in ear volumes. Not all media player apps allow changing your preamp (at eq) but aside, these buds are keepers, perhaps as my primary set.

I find any in ear buds need the foam tip. The shiny clean silicone tips .. bite in my opinion. These buds with foam, fit into the ear and stay there. With silicone, they fall out for me anyway.

These in ear monitors have a two year warranty which explains the heavy construction. Again - its very usable and becomes flexible quickly.

My set came with EASILY removable connector at the driver.

Recommend."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy these! Buy these now. Stop reading and buy them. Less than $100 and the sound isolation and sound you receive is well above any competitor that I have tried and I have tried many! The fact that they make a wireless setup now to use the existing earphones...sold! Shut up and take my money. I have been a fan of Shure headphones for at least a decade now. They do not disappoint for running, mountain biking, during a work out whatever really. Long cord is the only is awesome but must be managed but like I said, wireless setup if that is a problem for you."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but have a little trouble getting the ear position right. Love the sound isolating ear pads, but the ear position seems to be off and causes discomfort after long periods of use. I frequently fly long-haul flights (8 hours plus) and find that these cause pain after about 4 hours of use. If I adjust the fit and twist them forward in my ear, it relieves the pain...but they seem to slip back into the painful position after just a few minutes.

To clarify, these are shaped to fit inside your outer ear canal. The best fit for me is when the cord exits my ear at about the 9 o'clock position, and then loops up over my ear. However, the natural weight and pulling of the cord, rotates the earphones so that they exit at the 11 o'clock position causes pain after a while."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I knew based on reviews from Amazon and audiophile websites that these would be a good pair of headphones, but I didn't expect nearly the fidelity these have.

Real bass and fine treble, I'm hearing things I've completely missed. As my typical speaker test, I hook these up to a greatest hits station. Songs that everyone has heard a million times in the car, in your headphones, and on home stereos, so you get a great comparison from what you expect the song to sound like.

Definitely have a great clarity. On Sloop John B, I was hearing backup vocals and parts of the harmony that I'd totally missed before. On Walk like an Egyptian, I heard stress and cracking in Susanna's voice that is covered up on your typical car speakers."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"not 5 star more like 3 but read to find out why, they only really show 5 star reviews but honestly these headphones were okay but not worth the price or hassel. The sound was okay, not the best and not the worst but expected more since the price was so high and i thought they would be good and i even bought two pairs. That is something i regret, honestly not worth a buy, in order to change the ear pads u had to grab it, twist and turn n pull iy off and it damn near destroys the one you ate pulling off plus they arent too comfortable in the ear, it gives me a headache sometimes but any headphones will do that when you were them too long and they dont stay in very well plus really confusing to actually twist the thing to figure out had to get it in your ear. So in the end i recommend some sony headphones like 40 or50 dollars worth, dont spend too much cuz at the end of the day the headphones can only sound so good plus theyre just headphone use your money on more importany things, trust me i bought two of these and i wish i hadnt."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best product that I have ever put in my ears. I have owned everything from beats to bose. These top them all.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to insert, don't fully block outside sounds because you can't get them completely in your ear canal unlike the older SE models."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound...as expected. I had a pair of e2 and wore them out.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality! Great clear sound. Fit is perfect it has several alternatives. Plug can be tricky for somw devices since it has a 90degree angle. Color code is very useful for detecting which ear bud is right or left.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews I had read prior to purchasing, and the over ear fit was cumbersome."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very full sound, nice clarity, not sure how good it is for runners. One side kept coming out as my ears got sweaty. Great for in-ears for musicians at church."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really difficult to get in my ears. Sound was average
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright you guys. These headphones, how can I say it.. They are fantastic. At least they are now. I went and bought myself rubber tips for my refurb SE-215's (the SpinFit CP800, if you're curious) and not only do I now get a fantastic seal on the monitors, no, the sound quality (particularly the bass) has significantly improved! The monitors are able to distinguish very clearly between instruments, and avoid the mushiness that is often a problem with cheaper corded and cordless versions (and some very expensive Bose-products). The resolution at which they can fill your ear-holes with noise is fantastic for both the price, and the size of the driver. They are more evenly tuned, giving less oomph in the bass department as many would prefer, but the bass these headphones sport is exciting in its own way. Precise, and not mushy or overbearing.

So, if you are regretting your purchase, or are still undecided: The 215's are excellent monitors, without foam tips more so than with. The foam tips take a lot of the crispness and precision away that make these monitors so amazing."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound incredible, but the bass is subpar.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought a pair of these headphones because my power beats ear hook broke after 2 years of heavy use. So what does a person do when they broke there headphones buy new ones right ? I go on Amazon and mind you 2 pairs of headphones before my power beats I had bought a wired version of the 215 so I had a wired connection for the 215 ( I thought just in case I want to go wired I have the option , but mainly bought them for Bluetooth) so I had an extra wired connection. Package arrives I go to unbox it and I get both pair of earphones on the Bluetooth cable and yes on the Right and Left side. Press middle button on remote part of mic , Headphones pair icon replaces Bluetooth icon ( iOS ) and on right side shows battery life so I am thinking ok it's connected. Squuzes Foam on earbuds to put them in my ear and began to test out my pair New URE SE215SPE-W-BT1. I hear the head ones say paired and battery percentage but only the right side works !!!! Me thinking out I must of done something wrong right ? I read the manual and go through everything again and still nothing so I am ok let me get my wire connection to see if it's the earpieces ? I connect Both sides and they Both Work and sounds sooooo Good way better tham my power beats hands down . So I go online to see if I am the only one with this problem and turns out I am not. SURE please make sure your cable work before you send them I love the product so much I pretty much just kept them because I have a wire connection to make them wired and they sound so amazing plus I have no headphones. I hope to resolve this issue with SURE because if not I am going to look elsewhere for Bluetooth headphones such as the air pods but I would stay with SURE in a heartbeat because it's a better sounding product simple as that."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Both the earphones which i purchased, came in good packaging and the sound quality was awesome. Good amount of bass, music clarity was awesome & the isolation from external sounds is damn good, as the ear buds contours to your ear shape. Wires are good and thick. Suitable for both indoor and out door use too as the wire goes behind your ears and wont slip that easy."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones themselves are great and work wonderfully but my package was missing the different size ear bud pieces that fit to your ear so I'm stuck using the large ones that came on it. :(
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this set better than my clear pair!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: These make the world around you silent. I went from Beats Studio's with active noise cancellation to these and the difference is dramatic. Sound quality is great.

Cons: They hurt my ears when I first put them in, but I got used to putting them in and taking them out."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know that it is unfair of me to review a product that I didn't even get to use, but this product has given me an absolutely dreadful experience. I didn't see any other review about this issue, so I am stepping in to warn others about it.

After removing my product from its packaging, I discovered that the stock sleeves (foam) had fused to the stem of the earbuds. I took to the Internet, searching for solutions. Even after trying increasingly aggressive methods (including freezing the earbuds), I was utterly unable to remove the sleeves. Rather than coming off, they have torn, and their remnants still wrap around the stem like a glued-on sheath. It is unacceptable for this to happen at this price point.

Even if you're not dealing with a completely fused sleeve out of the box, it seems that many people have difficulty switching out the stock sleeves (so much so, that it is a known issue: http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3788/~/removing-earphone-sleeves). If you are considering this product, and want to be able to customize the comfort of the device, know that you face a hurdle right out of the gate. I pray that your experience goes much smoother than mine.

***Edit***

Ordered a replacement pair after experiencing the difficulties outlined above. On the new pair, I was able to (not easily though) get the stock sleeves off and find a set of sleeves that best fit me. Now, after actually using the earbuds, I think that they are pretty good. The fit might bother some individuals, and putting them on certainly is not intuitive. But those are minor issues that disappear after some practice. The much more likely deal-breaker is the sound quality. The sound quality takes a little getting used to. My previous earbuds were the SkullCandy Heavy Medals, which lasted just shy of a full 3 years, and survived heavy use. When I fired up the Shure earbuds, I was a little disappointed. The Heavy Medals have better lows and have higher volume (keeping volume settings neutral--which is not that big of a deal; easily fixed by turning up the volume). But, after giving the Shures some extended listening, I found that they gave me a better sound in general. I now prefer the sound of the Shures to that of the Heavy Medals. That said, the Heavy Medals are fantastic earbuds, and I recommend both of these products. I feel as if many earbuds emphasize bass, since it has such a tremendous effect on the listening experience. So, when people try to upgrade to higher quality earbuds and find that things are a little tinny or ""reduced,"" they are ultimately letdown. If you are a bass-head, you probably won't like these earbuds. But, if you want a very well-rounded listening experience, these earbuds shouldn't disappoint.

As of now, I can't speak to the durability of these earbuds, but they feel solid enough."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound and great sound damping I would highly recommend them at this price point I find it hard to believe they can be beat.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked my Etymotic headphones, but I am in love with these Shure. Much stronger bass, they are more flush with my head so I can take a nap with them in, and the overall sound is incredible for the price point. Definitely worth the money."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your looking for earphones that sound great and have nice bass, then these earphones are a great choice. They are very comfortable but only if you put them in your ear properly. At first they seem weird because they are different from other earphones that I have worn but after a few days I found out how to properly put them on my ear to fit very comfortably, and this position also gives you the best bass. I am very satisfied with these earphones."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for moise reduction and sound even better.I'm a singing drummer and am very pleased with this product.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"High End-ish, that is. Had them for about four months.
Sound quality is so much better than Skull Candys, Apple earphones/""earpods"" (or whatever they're called), those cheap earphones you get at 5below or Walmart... I can't go back to those after using these because they sound just terrible.
I appreciate that it comes with a carrying case and has all the different sizes buds. They stay in my ears much better than Skull Candy earphones, though I've always thought those were a joke anyway. BUT, they do still fall out sometimes. Seal is good, and I'm using the correct size buds (I think) but they just do. Only reason they lost a star for me is because of that."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Received my headphones in a very timely fashion and and really pleased with what I got. They sound amazing and are really good quality. Would totally recommend.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm used to owning cheap $40 earphones so this one required a bit of diving into the pockets, but it's worth it. For the price, the sound quality is unparalleled. I literally cannot hear a thing when I am listening to music. I also use it on stage as I play in a band and the bass packs a good punch. Considering it even has a two year warranty, I consider it one of the best investments that can be made."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Awesome. After about 2 months, the sound stopped working in the left ear. AWESOME!!!! *sigh* I mean, the sound quality is really great, but if I'm gonna pay $100 for these things, is it too much to expect them to last me quite a while? $100 is a lot to spend on something that will only last me 2 months."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good and definitely isolate. Putting them in takes some getting used to. I don't use them daily, so it's not second nature yet. Singing on stage, I've been mostly using only one, which worked great in that particular setting."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything the description says. I use them everyday and the construct seems very durable. Its just a bit annoying trying to put them on because of the way the wire are coiled above your ears.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones for use while motorcycle riding. Any rider knows that wind noise can be very fatiguing, and I was looking for a way to combat that while still being able to use my in-helmet communication system. For the price, I think these achieved the desired result pretty well. The sound quality is surprisingly good - certainly good enough for the road, which allows me to turn down the volume and still be able to hear clearly. I have ridden 14 hour days with these in and they remain comfortable, and I am noticeably less mentally fatigued. I have not experienced any distortion at higher volumes, but this could be because I can't turn the volume up loud enough to try without killing my ears. I love that the cords are quick disconnects and that the potion that connects directly to each ear phone is wrapped in a shielding that retains its position once bent, which makes getting a full face helmet on easier to achieve (although it does take some practice the first few times).

On the negative side of things, the cord for this is much too long. Figuring out how to stash all that cord will be an initial frustration. I didn't knock of stars for this, though, because I'm using this product in a manner that was not intended. I did knock off a star; however, for the foam pieces that insert into the ear. I have two complaints: 1) they don't retain their shape well enough, which means that if you don't put them in exactly the same way every time, you're going to get some unwanted noise. 2) The foam becomes slippery as you sweat inside a helmet. Again, I know that I'm using them for an unintended purpose, but this is aimed at musicians. For those of you who have never been on stage, we musicians sweat... alot - those lights are much hotter than one would think. My point is that I would consider this issue to be an issue regardless of the fact that I'm using them on a motorcycle. This issue doesn't affect me much, as I always wear a full face helmet, so the helmet holds them in my ears; however, I could see riders who ride without a helmet or who ride with a half helmet having greater and greater trouble getting the earphones to stay in their ears over the course of a long ride."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure mines came defective as I can hear static when listening, but I also noticed the earphones have great background sound but the singer's voice sounds far and hollow. Not worth $100 My Image S4 earphones sound better and they're only $40."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a lot of headphones. Everything from Sennheiser over ear headphones, to Klipsch in ears, a few varieties of Koss headphones and even Skull Candies in my younger days. I can say that these are without a doubt my favorite headphones that I have ever owned."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our son really enjoys his Shure earphones!
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For it's price, the bass is powerful and tight but not overwhelming. The Mids are decent although not as warm as I would like. The lows are decent and the highs are very clear. Overall, the best $120 I spent on earphones. It competes well with earphones twice the price but wearing them takes some getting used to."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones provide fantastic isolation, and very directed sound. When I take them out, even if they're blasting, you can barely hear the music coming out of them. Well, in my office. YMMV, of course."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best earphones you will find for $100.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my last pair of Shures so much, I decided on another pair after trying other less expensive options. None of them do such a good job of noise isolation as the Shures, period. And the sound quality is very nicely balanced, not too bright, not too boomy, just right. And the replaceable cables make these the very best value hands down. No buyers remorse here."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,works very well - a noticeable improvement in design from the last set that I bought in 2008 (the old version's cables are cracked up and there was no way to replace the cables so i like the new design of replacement cords).
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome quality. Fair price.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Professional Sound at a Modest Price....well made with Replaceable Cables...
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i really wanted to love these, but after a couple of days, i have to send them back. i have the SE215 wired, and also the 315 wired. they were amongst the best headphones i've ever had... and when i found the bluetooth wires for the SE215 drivers, i jumped on it immediately and couldn't wait until it arrived.

so first the pros:
- the drivers are solid, fit in my ear like a glove
- the wire itself seems to be solidly made and looks like it could withstand some daily commute abuse in NYC.

the cons: from the moment i put them on, the music consistently cut out in the left ear, only the left. the right sounded great... now if i can just get both ears working. when worn around the neck and the drivers over the ear, the microphone fell right below my ear. i thought that was a bit strange and the cable too short, but gave it a go. the result was horrific. the voice being transmitted sounded as if i was using a cordless phone from the 1980s and i walked too far away from the base. the static was louder than the actual voices, and when the voice actually came through, it was garbled or sounded robotic. i thought it could've been a defective cable, so i switched out the driver onto the second pair i purchased... same result. actually, it was worse.

i'm now returning them in hopes that Shure will step up and fix the issues, and lengthen the cable so one can actually talk into it rather than have it hidden behind the ear."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this on stage as an in ear monitor and it worked great. Going to buy another one for another musician.

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love em !!!! Amazing sound and clarity. Using these in my worship band at church, on stage.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hard for me to find earbuds that are comfortable for any extended period of time. These aren't perfect but they have great sound (clear highs and mids, and enough bass to support both) and are plenty comfortable while traveling around. I haven't taken them on a plane yet, but on buses/trains they do a great job of reducing outside noise."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, just what I needed."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,He seems to like them. They are a major step up from what is included with the iphone. Would recommend them again and again.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing. I love the sound quality and how they wrap around the ear. I recommend them to all my friends who ask about a good headphone to buy
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. These won't cancel out sound, but they do cut down most of it. Good bass as well. I am a machinist and a drummer. I don't need to blast the music to clearly hear it."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this ear phone a year ago and used it during travel and workout. The left speaker stopped working after a year.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your an audiophile, this is the best headphone in its price range! The clarity is incredible! The details are definable from its 22.5Hz to 17.5kHz. I am a musician and I wear these daily in the moments of when I'm in transit.

If I could change one thing, I do wish it had a highs extending to 20kHz, but nonetheless, totally satisfied with these."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was pretty disappointed with these. Special ordered them for a work-related music event to use them with a sound pack at a show. They fell out of my ears during the entire gig. Ended up returning them.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound for the price though ears get sore with long use
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these to sing with at church and I can't hardly hear anything that isn't going through the speakers. Sometimes good, sometimes bad 😉! But I can hear the music really well, so it's great to sing with."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,better sound than the bose one. I bought it for my husband and he was pretty happy about the sound quarity.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I looked around for a relatively affordable quality pair of headphones and saw this product reviewed a couple places online. After receiving these I carry them everywhere with me - I'm addicted to the quality of sound they provide and how well they reduce incoming noises from other sources. I use for sound monitoring at home while editing as well as while I'm out listening to Pandora. For me this was a great purchase.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these about 3 hours ago and am truly impressed. I purchased them mainly for working out and they excelled with staying in the ear. Not once did I need to adjust them, which is something I was constantly doing with previous earphones. Great sound and they stay in the ear!! My wife tried them and now she wants a pair. Don't hesitate on purchasing these little gems!!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a former Bose ""over-the-ear"" user, I decide to give these a try after my Bose headphones literally fell apart after nearly 10 years of flying every week for work. Bass response is better, noise canceling is better, no batteries, less bulky.. what's not like? Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, they work wonders when I'm playing the drums. I can keep them at a low volume and not worry about blasting my ears."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure why my experience seems to be so different from the majority of the reviews here. I bought these based on a recommendation from someone at a local GC and the reviews here. Here are my beefs:
Sound: I find the sound to be thin, very little bass.
Fit: I have tried all the buds and cannot find one that just feels right for me. They always feel loose which might contribute to the sound seeming thin. The over the ear design is somewhat odd for me.
Sound Isolating: this is the area where my experience is really differnet from many of the reviews. I would not classify these as sound isolating at all. I wore them on a plane flight the other day and frankly I felt they blocked no more noise than a cheap pair of skull candy's that I have.

Overall I'm glad I had used a gift certificate on these because if I had paid full freight for them I'd be even more disappointed than I am now. I'll probably just use these at work and try to find a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones elsewhere.

**Update**
Well I feel kind of stupid. I just couldn't understand why these things just never felt right. Well, I had them in the wrong ears! I noticed one had a very small red dot on it and I thought that maybe meant right, but it just didn't look like it would work in the right ear. After working on it a bit, I got it in and it fit and felt much better, making a large difference to how it sounded. Still not ""sound isolating"", but pretty good. So now I upped my review to four stars and will see how they do the next time I'm on a plane."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delivers great sound and ear buds stay nicely in ears. They provide a nice carrying case and extra ear cuffs.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely a good value. Great alternative to over the ear headphones. Decent bass response for the size and cost. Blocks outside noise as well as in ear noise protection.

This is my second pair - hubby borrowed the first set and misplaced them. Glad I purchased another!"

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are some fantastic IEMs for the price...
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good:

Decent job of blocking outside noise. Not great, but decent.

Once you manage to get them in your ears, they're not going anywhere (unless you tug on the inflexible cord, see below.)

The bad:

Sound quality is very poor. I'm no audiophile and can't use all the fancy sound descriptions that professional reviewers use, but I'll try my best. I listen to a lot of power metal and heavy rock. Vocals are generally fine. Drums have some decent punch to them. *Everything* else in the midrange and treble blends together into one muffled, muddied mess. These earphones make the instrumentation lose every ounce of subtlety. I've tried it on three different audio devices. I've tried messing around with equalizers and treble/bass sliders. Nothing helps at all. I don't necessarily expect perfection here, but I've had $20 earphones that sound three times better than this.

Speaking to less important features: it's a small challenge to get these properly settled in your ears, although this may be easier with practice. The cords next to the speakers are particularly stiff, making it difficult to get the curve around the ear, too. The cords end up going over the ears and look really dumb (I wouldn't normally care, but it's insult to injury). The unit as a whole is rather heavy, especially around the ears; it's difficult to forget you're wearing these.

For all the good reviews and professional recommendations, this is a profoundly disappointing buy."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these 4 times. The left headphone went dead, then the right. They are totally useless now"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,connectivity is spotty. Bulky and gets in the way.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought what I thought to be a nice set of EIM for a 2 month trip through Asia as I wanted something more compact than my over ear noise cancelling headphones. These headphones had problems almost immediately. They are quite comfortable and do a good job blocking out sound but they hardly ever work. Sound only comes from 1 ear the majority of the time and I have to fiddle with the cords to try to make the other ear work. Hoping this is an isolated issue and Shure will be willing to replace them once I return from my trip. For now I am stuck with some crappy headphones for a rather hefty price though.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good isolation, good soundstage, nice sound separation, a lil bit of lack in bass, but definitely worth the money. They're also kind of weird to put on, but you get used in a couple of days."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for the money. These would make wonderful studio monitors. They block out a ton of sound. I can't even hear my mechanical keyboard as I type (i can always hear it). The sound these things make is great, nice and even albeit a little warm. I'm not a basshead but there is a tad of bass emphasis on these IEM's. The sound signature is warm, like I said, and because of this the treble is not that poppy. The treble is the only downside to these, but if you are looking for a nice mid-tone IEM than look no further. If these are to expensive, you might want to take a look at the v sonic vsd3s or vsd3. As for build quality, i would probably have faith putting this cable through a blender. I like how long the cable is, maybe not the most convenient for using with a phone, which buy the way can drive these, but still great in the long run. The addition of the detachable cable extends the lifespan of these earphones indefinitely, given that you don't overdrive them. I've tested these with a few songs most of them being chillstep (lossless quality of course): Odesza, say my name; The Glitchmob: carry the sun; Blackmill, friend; and Muse; MK ultra. I would say these headphones are great performers for the price category, slightly better IEM's are available if you have 20 or 30 more dollars, but the detachable cable is an amazing feature imo. I gave these 4 out of 5 stars because the lack of rich treble (don't worry its still there and sounds great its just not as emphasized as I would like, maybe not good for a lot of pop music) and also because my 215's weren't packaged correctly from the factory.(This is probably a purely isolated incident.) Amazon did a fine job with packaging, but it looks like the machine that puts the IEM's in the plastic blister part scuffed up the foam ear-tip and damaged it, it doesn't affect the quality of the music or the seal at all (thankfully). However, i think this might decrease the lifespan of the tip, but it is no big deal as as the 215's come with silicon tips as well. I found that the silicon tips give punchier bass while the foam tips provide more isolation and maybe a tad bigger sound stage. I think the foam tips are also nicer because they have a small filter that prevents debris from going inside the housing. Overall, great buy, probably the best earphone for greater durability and good sound quality at exactly 100 dollars. If you want insane sound quality, look elsewhere, maybe the westone line; however if you value durability slightly more these are great.
Update: these are not great for people with small ears. I'm a guy with tiny a$$ ears, smaller than some female's. These do leave a sore spot in the back of my ear after about 30 minutes, still great, guess I'll have to get a tough spot there.Also negative profile fit is great for sleeping."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just purchased these for the third time. I've also held off on buying a new iPhone because I have yet found any Bluetooth or lightning cable headphones I feel would match these. I use these in the gym, and they not only cancel all outside noise out but sound fantastic. The only negative is they don't last forever. After two years of heavy gym use including a lot of sweat one of the headphones started shorting out."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Help! Instructions were unclear. I don't know how to remove it from my ears.

Really though, fits perfectly, comfortable, the cable seems strong and durable. The detachable and rotating plugs should prevent damages to the wiring, common in all earphones I had till now. It's just too well built, can't phrase it in other way.

The sound. It's crystal clear throughout all ranges. Clean bass, clean mid, clean treble. Haven't experienced saturation at any level. It's also very loud, compared to my HyperX Cloud, which I wear over it for comm. It is also very responsive, you can boost the bass and it will not hurt the trebles as much.

It's expensive, but it's by far the most clean, responsive earphone Ive had."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, I've been using SE215's since 2012 and I'm more than happy with them in every way. I use them every day for extended periods and for running and they're comfortable and enjoyable each and every time.

The one downside is with the clear material used in the product-- it's less flexible then the black version and over-time (this has happened three times with me) the connection where the cable runs into the sheathing on the thicker/protected area of the piece that rests on the ear becomes damaged.

I'm sure if you carefully put it away in the case after each use this wouldn't happen to you, but I use them daily and feel that I use them as a regular user realistically would after the first week of ownership. Even with that downside (I invest in the replacement clear cable, or get a new set each time it happens) I'm happy because the clear ones are less obtrusive, especially if you're wandering around with them in a work-place. So even with that issue, I don't feel it's worth knocking a star."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones as usual from shure. I bought this to use with my SE535.
BUT the wireless cable is way way too long, super uncomfortable when running or training in the gym,
It bounces, it tangles, all bad!! I don’t recomend it for any kind of training, just regular listening.
Also the Bluetooth is not very good, I use it behind the neck and I lose connection all the time.
Not worth the high price."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly this pair of earphones are rather comfortable. They fit very nicely flush into your ears so using them while lying down on your sides is not a problem (something that I do quite often). This is compared to the UE triple-fi 10 which really sticks out and makes you look really weird too.

Sound quality wise they are pretty much one of the best in this price range. They are not flat or neutral sounding, the sound is slightly coloured, more towards the bass side of things but I feel that that makes it a good pair of casual earphones as flat sounding earphones tend to get fatiguing to use after awhile. So if you're not an audio professional and just using this for your daily commute it does a fine job.

However if you're the running with music person this is not the pair of earphones you want to wear while exercising. Even though the removable cables make it easier to change cables that have worn out, the connectors between the cables and the earphones are another point of failure that has been introduced. Sweat can get in easily to wreak havoc with your earphones and I have a pair that suffered a loose connection but Shure's warranty took care of that nicely.

The cable's 3.5mm jack is also L-shaped and kind of large so if you happen to use it with your phone that has a case with a tight opening for the audio jack it might not be able to fit.

Despite some shortcomings I still believe that for this price this are the earphones to get. In fact I've gotten an additional 2 pairs as gifts for friends and the feedback has been very positive."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Westone W20's (three sets). All purchased directly from Westone (trying to avoid Amazon's CA sales tax). All failed within the warrantee period. On the last set one of ear piece cases simply fell apart - lost the other case half so couldn't glue it back together! The other two had cable and electronic issues. Fidelity was okay with the Westone's but they kept falling apart. Frustrating! AMERICAN made? Hardly!

I now have a set of Shure SE215-K's and they are GREAT! Much better cables! Better construction! Very comfortable! The fidelity is as good as Westone, IMO! My music voice is classical guitar, Celtic instrumental and some ""new age"". They all sound wonderful! Not too much bass and not too much treble. Well balanced for my music choices! I don't use the foam sleeves preferring the Soft Flex silicone sleeves - they work great! To each their own....

I wonder what took me so long to wake up! Guess it's my devotion to the idea of ""American Made""."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so glad Shure created this cable. I currently own the 3.5mm which came with my se215 special edition in-ear headphones. I also purchase the lightning cable that I really enjoy, but this is exactly what I was hoping for. Love this cable, sounds great and the controls work very well with iPhone. The inline mic also works very well. I couldn't be more pleased."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're going for noise isolation, these are by far the best headphones in the $100 range. After going through a pair of Beats Solo, Bose MEI2I - or close to that model, and another pair of Klipschs I found the Shures to be outstanding in the sound quality and isolation traits. A few notes below.

PROS
• Complete noise isolation. Really, you can't hear anything if you have them in and 25% volume on your phone or computer
• Cable is long and can easily reach wherever you have your computer/laptop/phone/etc
• Cable can be routed behind head and there is a slider that will hold the headphones tight to your ears
• 3 different tips shipped with headphones for personal fit
• Extremely durable cord that can be replaced, swapped for different color separate from the ear piece

CONS
• After wearing them for 6-8 hours, your ears will get tired. I've never encountered a pair of in ear headphones where this wasn't the case"

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If your looking for an above average ear bud that will last, you can't find a better deal. Quality!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you ever though “I need better headphones”? If yes, the Shure SE215 Sound Isolating Earphones are some of the best you can buy. These headphones will fit every need you have surrounding headphones. They are made with quality materials, have amazing sound quality, and fit extremely well. Also, the Shure SE215 headphones are considered to be relatively cheap when compared competitors.

SOUND
The sound quality of these headphones is extremely good. These headphones have a much brighter sound compared to competitors and preform well with any kind of music. Many headphones are not produced with range that the Shure headphones are produced with, which is why these headphones have a much better sound quality. These headphones also offer sound isolation. This is not the same as noise cancelling headphones as the do not emit any frequencies to counter act any noise surrounding you. However, these headphones fit extremely well and provide a high degree of sound isolation, the ability to block out noises from the surrounding environment. This sound isolation is better for sound quality because you only get the frequency of the sound and not the frequency used to cancel outside noise.

FIT
These headphones do not fit like normal ear buds; they wrap around your ear. This is not something you think will be better than traditional ear buds, but that is not the case. Because they wrap around your ear your headphones rarely come out of place. Also when being active, it provides extra support and a firmer hold. The Shure SE215’s also come with a wide rage or tips for the headphones so you can be sure they will comfortably fit in your ear.

QUALITY
Unlike most headphones these are made with high quality materials. The cord is made out of braided steal covered in a resistant yet foldable plastic. This means the cord will not rip, tear or break in any manor. The part that wraps around your ear is made from a very thick plastic which holds the shape you bend it to. This is beneficial because when they are wrapped around your ears you do not want them to move. The tips are also very high quality. They are made thicker than usual so they are more resistant to tears and fit much better in your ear.

These headphones are great for everyone, but mostly specifically someone who is looking for an affordable upgrade. They have incredible sound quality and almost as high of materials quality. As an added bonus, Shure made the ear buds detachable so if one earbud breaks you only have to the part instead of brand new headphones. The purchase of these headphones comes free of buyer’s remorse and will blow you away!"

We'll see how the warranty claim goes...

UPDATE: I live in the Chicago area and so I brought my SE215s directly to SHURE. They changed out the bad ear bud and I was on my way in 10-minutes! Yes, the ear bud blew and I'm not sure why, but the customer service was impeccable. I am probably going to upgrade to 1964ears, but the great service makes me think long and hard about going away from SHURE.

I'm buyer of in ears for years and wish someone had convinced me to get these much earlier. Impressive in all aspects. For the audiophile the soundstage could be bigger and the mid-highs/highs more sharp and sparkly but they're very crisp. Easily the best option under $150.

I then bought a replacement pair of these earphones, but have found the quality to be tremendously worse this time around. After 6 months of use, the jacks where the cable attaches to the earphones have come loose. This results in me hearing an annoying knocking sound whenever the cable moves (which is all the time).

I've owned my pair for about a year and two months, and they're still as durable as when I first got them.

As mentioned in other reviews, the sound is crisp and clear. The cord is a bit long, but it's thick and smooth, and doesn't become tangled easily.

What I'd like to emphasize on most is how comfortable these are. The fit itself is perfect once I got used to them. It did take a while to break in, maybe 2-3 weeks of moderate use - my ears would ache from wearing them after a mere 30 minutes, but now they sit comfortably around my ears and never fall loose (and most importantly, don't hurt to wear at all). Personally, the foam tips caused some pressure and discomfort to my ear canals, so a few days into owning them, I switched to the silicone ones (problem solved!) and haven't gone back.

These are completely worth the investment."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,BE WARNED: The cables break very easy. However Amazon was very good and have replaced them 3 times already.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love that they share the casing and detachable cable design with the SE535, though like some of the other reviewers I too had an issue with the audio cutting out in one of the ears (left) due to what I imagine to be the detachable cable. I got around this issue by simply turning the cable 180 degrees and bending it the opposite direction around my ear and haven't had any real issues. I also bought the CBL+M+K cable for my iphone 4 which eliminated the issue as well, so it must be in the cable itself, not the actual connector. Either way, with both cables, they sound great for the $100 price tag.

They fit fantastic as well! I can't stand IEM that stick out to far, or buds that just rest in your ears. These offer as much isolation as any others, and provide decent quality sound for casual listening or even stage performance. They aren't super accurate given the single driver, and I've heard crisper highs and better mids... but again, at $100 I am very happy with them so far. There is PLENTY of low end if that's important to you, but low mids are a bit much on some records, but again... GREAT bang for the buck! I would have much rather bought the 535's or some of the much better Westone custom products, but the savings was worth it!

I would recommend these to most anybody looking for a decent IEM for iPod's or stage monitors... again if accuracy is important, you will have to spend more."

The first rehearsal I used my studio cans and it was OK for a live gig, but I can't play with those beasts on (Apple earbuds forget about it). The drums are loud, even with a plexiglass shield. I was recommended these and I was skeptical the bass response would be any good. Got them just in time and wow! Very impressed at the quality and bass response/tone on these. At first, I was a little picky about the tone and quality, but as soon as every started playing it was totally fine.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually super disappointed to write this review. These came recommended from a friend of mine who knows his stuff when it comes to audio but these missed the mark drastically.

The headphones themselves are really not well designed. Quarky to fit in your ear and constantly fall out when they are in. Even after bending the chord, etc, they still feel really unnatural. Aside from the earpiece, the blue tooth connector/chord are fairly cumbersome and did not mesh well with the fact that I have to wear a jacket (NYC winter) and were constantly getting pulled off my ears.

The bluetooth was atrocious. Constantly bouncing the signal depending on if the chord was under my jacket, etc.

When they worked, the audio was strong and good quality but since the chord that plugs into the earpieces is movable (can spin, etc) - the audio would get really scratchy and turn off/on if the chord moved the wrong way.

Ended up tabling these after having them for a week and bought beats, which I was not happy with since I'm sure there's better quality out there for less $, unfortunately - these just weren't the fix."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2-3 charges the BT unit stopped charging, making the headphones useless.

That issue aside, I'm on the fence about whether I would buy this product again. I had the Shure SE210, which I first bought over a decade ago. After going through other in-ear headphones, I ended up going back to this. I miss the sound. I tried a couple of different set-ups prior to getting these. Alas, the SE210 has been discontinued, and I started to try different bluetooth options for when my primary set up gets totally obsoleted. Primarily, I use an iPod shuffle+ SE210 (using the short wire), so I will compare an iPhone with Shure215 BT with my previous set up.

Sound. The sound using an iPod+SE210 is better than the sound over iPhone+SE215BT. Having said that, the bar is high. The SE215BT sounds much better than any other BT headphone I've owned - Beats, Jaybird, and JBL. My Jaybirds were first generation, and the beats were also first generation. The JBL is still on the market today.

Form factor. The form factor of the iPod+SE215 is better. This is because I don't have to carry a phone around me. In addition, the wires are neat and behind my back. With the bluetooth headphones, I have a heavy battery behind me, and a dongle on my side. The weight is all over the place - I can manage the battery by tucking it in my shirt, but I still have a control dongle flapping around. I weighed the iPod+SE210 set up and the SE215. They are about the same weight, with the SE215 coming about .1 oz lighter. But the bluetooth headphones *feels* heavier in use. (I think it is like carry a political protester... these guys/gals are like 100lbs wet, and are easy to lift if they want to be. But when they ""go limp"" cops who can bench 150 will struggle carrying around 100lbs of flopping limbs. The SE215 is a protester ""going limp"".)

Electronics. Obviously this is more of a ""BT v wired"" debate. Wired is just easier. BT requires extra charging. My iPhone started connecting directly to the headset, then stopped. I had to forget the device, then bring it back on. I was adding 2-3 minutes of messing around with the set-up prior to a workout on a regular basis - checking the battery, checking the connection, inserting the headphones, correcting each step. A little of the extra time is getting used to putting on these headphones. A little of the extra tension is trusting that an inherently untrustworthy connection is there every time.

Finally, as noted, after a few weeks of using this, the battery will no longer charge. I'm still under warranty, and expect to get this issued resolved.

I would recommend these, despite the warts (except the battery issue, which is kind of a big deal if not resolved). The warts are all BT related. The sound of BT is just not as good as similar wired headsets; but as far as bluetooth headphones are concerned, these are very good sounding. The form factor is not good because of the BT components needed. And inconvenience of setting up is really sometime I've come to expect with BT. (Even when connecting an iPhone to the car, it takes a minute longer than just turning on the radio. But it's a minute without peace. Is there enough charge in the headset; is there enough charge in the phone; will the phone connect; will I be able to listen to the songs I've been looking forward to all day when I workout? It's all not a big deal, except that it can ruin your commute or workout, start the day just a bit off kilter, or end it with a sour note.) These are all issues inherent with BT of any kind.

So, if you need to go with BT headphones because Apple and Samsung and others have taken away the headphone jack and replaced it with an inferior dongle, the SE215 is a good to excellent choice (assuming this battery charging issue gets fixed). But it is not as good as an obsolete Shure 210 with an obsolete Apple iPod Shuffle. It is tough to give 5 stars to a product that is not as good as the previous generation. It is tough to give 4 starts to a product that doesn't work after 3 weeks. But it is tough to give 1 star that seems to be the best of its class (BT headphones) for sound. I guess 2 is fair."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for starting out and new to in ear monitors
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Look no further- just buy these....The Best!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought these earphones, I was unsure about the quality and build of the earphones themselves, but I've been proven wrong. The quality of the earphones is great, very well built all connectors are gold plated, and the wire really allow them to tangle. In some pictures they don't look completely clear but they are transparent, the wires have a cream tint but are clear.
The sound quality is great, really high volumes, my right ear phone starts to pinch at my ear, but that's only at full volume on most devices. These are great at noise canceling, I can't hear besides the music most of the time. People will raise their voices and I'll still be in peace. These are originally made for a musician in a band, or soloist. I wouldn't doubt these working great for hearing what needs to be sung or heard. Also another thing Id like to point out is if you like sleeping whilst listening to something these are very comfortable and fit great. They also come with different sets of bits that go into your ears, they all feel great.
Another thing is these are not extremely bass heavy, they just improve the sound quality equally. So worth the price? In my opinion, yes they are great and work awesome, for any time your traveling or in school, or in a loud place where you just want to be to yourself and enjoy music, these are perfect."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After many years loyal to the Shure brand I am very sad to write a poor review. I will start by saying the amount of sound from these things is by far the best for the price. When they work. Bass and sound depth is all you could ask for. Now for the bad. I have been buying shure since 2004 for military travels around the world. Since then, I have only had to get 2 new sets because I lost one. I recently got my third set because it was time. I put them in and it sounds like the speakers are popped. Very staticy and distorted. Amazon sent a replacement right away because amazon is amazing and the wire is shorted out. I don't know why the construction is so crappy, but I am seriously disappointed."

Tested. Left earbud worked on Right side so it's the connection just like everyone said. I was aware of the issue, but it would never happen to me. But it did and i know Shure is aware of these problems and sends out potentially defective products anyway. Bad company. No pride. These earbuds have not yet been abused. It's really too bad Shure. I was satisfied with then before today. I know you wont miss my money, but i cant trust you. Have a good life and it's not personal. It's business."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound quality and comfort in these headphones. Definitely worth the price.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, excellent isolation good quality product"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 215s mainly due to their footprint: they recede almost entirely into the ear and so can be slept in comfortably, and they do sound pretty decent, for $100. The included case is serviceable (though not hardshell) and the standard variety of foam and silicon tips is included.

Relative to the HiFiMan RE-400s I was using previously, these exhibit a generally more accurate sound and wider soundstage, and the cable/strain relief appear to be of significantly higher quality. Plus, the cable is replaceable.

They are NOT in the same league as my Westone W30s. The low end is comparatively boomy and the entire spectrum sounds somewhat muted by comparison. That being said, the W30s retail at $400 and have three drivers, so I do not expect the 215s to have equivalent performance."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using SHURE earphones for quite a few years now, and it has been about 2 years since my last pair broke (old design before you could unplug the ear piece from the wires) and I always said I would get a new pair. I just never got around to do it, until in a spur of the moment I ordered a pair in the morning. I love being in LA where we get same day shipping! YES!! BE JEALOUS! j/k

But back to the headsets, hands down SHURE has been the best in ear headphones you could buy. This will be my 3 headset over the past 8 years and if these ever mess up I will buy another pair. The sound on these is just superb! And these are like there entry level ones... I can't even begin to imagine what their high end headsets sound like. I just don't make that kind of money! lol But I love these and I always recommend these to all my friends because hands down they are the best!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good, they are comfortable and noise-isolating, and the price is right. Unfortunately within two months of buying them the cable gave out and would only transmit a soft intermittent signal.

The the credit of the designers the ear buds easily detach so you can replace just the cable rather than the whole unit. This is a step up from the last Shure earphones I owned which were attached to the cable and had to be discarded when it broke (after many years of use).

The part that's tough to swallow is that the cable is over $30. A pair of standard Apple headphones, complete with ear buds and remote control, retails for $29 and is notoriously over-priced. It would be easier to shrug off if there weren't so many reports in the reviews of cables breaking. If the cable was high-quality enough to justify the high price tag, it wouldn't break so often.

I believe that part of the problem is in the old-fashioned, bulky, L-shaped design of the jack which is ill-suited to pocket devices. As you move around during the day the jack can rotate perpendicular to the device so it hangs off the edge, which can subject it to stress that's not an issue with a straight jack."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a jaded guy. I've had everything from electrostatic headphones to just about every major brand of earbuds known. I have some Sony sound cancelling headphones that are hard to beat, along with Yamaha earbuds that shine like new money.

This set from Shure shames them all.

Once you get the right foam tip on the end, and finally get it just right in the ear, the sound experience is unequaled. These buds are just like I like them, bright and flat. The bass is outstanding, not only in range (downward) but in clarity. These buds do not get the least bit 'boomy', which can happen frequently with earbuds. Some manufacturers seem to be overcompensating in the bass department, just because they are earbuds. These buds perform near perfect bass, without any doubling, rattling, or muffling. Quite an accomplishment.

The mid range area is really good. Vocals come through with a vibrant clarity I have never experienced before in speakers that fit inside the ear. The only experience I can relate it to is the mid-range horns in my Klipsch Heresy speakers, which absolutely KILL (in a good way) the vocal range. Excellent. (Stuff it Klipsch haters, there is no 'honkiness', it is a figment of your imagination.)

The high range is also quite good. High frequency overtone reproduction is so very important for completing the stereo imaging of mid and bass frequencies. This device delivers.

You would think it would be impossible to get such high definition bass, mid and high frequencies out of one driver. My hat is off to the engineers at Shure for pulling it off. Even the Yamaha EPH-100 can't quite do it, and they are really good.

Overall, I can't believe I waited so long to get a pair of these. Get some for yourself. These may be too good, in a sense, because such quality sound is not really needed in most applications that use earbuds: exercising, casual listening, etc. All I can say is it is better to have the capability and not need it than the opposite. With the Shure earbuds, I can tell if I am listening to a CD or MP3 where I cannot tell when using my JVC buds. You need to decide if you need that much quality. As for me, too much quality is just what I want.

The cords are a blessing and a curse. Being super (Kevlar) tough, they are a blessing since they will hardly tear up in normal use. Also, being replaceable is a fantastic option that should be on every pair of $100+ earbuds/phones like all cars have steering wheels. However, the material has to be 'taught' to stay in place. The over-the-ear cords do take some effort to get used to. It is worth the effort, believe me, although YMMV and it is a deal killer for you.

Also, I used some Radians earplug material to make myself some custom molded earphones, as many people do nowadays. The experience is 5 times better than with the expanding foam seals. You just will not hear anything from the outside, so driving with them is out of the question. I do use them to do yard work, and listen to my fave MP3's, so even while weed eating, I am listening to music with no interfering noise to speak of.

If you are an audiophile that needs some earphones, GET THESE NOW!!!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most Shure products, these earbuds have both exceptional sound and a high price tag. However, if you are like me and have had trouble finding ear buds that fit well (my canals are big, making a good seal difficult), these could be for you.

With a wide selection of sleeves materials (foam, silicon, rubberish) and styles, you will have a great shot at a good fit if you have massive canals. With the fit of these Shure's, I get a full range of bass that is impossible with a bad fit.

Also, the earpieces come apart from the cables, so a frayed cable can be replaced without the expense of an entirely new set of buds. Over the long-term, this could easily save you the incremental cost for these.

The only drawback is that they take a little getting used to due to the over the back of the ear way you wear them. I wish the part of the cable near the earpiece were a little more rigid to keep the right fit of curve over your ear. They are bendable with some rigidity, but once you take them off and store them, the exact curve you bent into them pretty much goes away, so you have to do it again when you wear them the next time.

If you do NOT have bizarrely large ear canals and are looking for a better value with very strong sound, try the Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black). I thought they sounded great, but I needed to hold them in to get a good seal. With normal ear canals, these would be a great purchase."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My review will be on 2 parts the first one is for the SE215 with the bluetooth cable and the second one will be on the bluetooth cable with the SE846

I would give it 5/5

The SE846

Am so disappointed with the bluetooth cable and the SE846 it sounds worse than the SE215 and there is a cutting in the sound every few seconds and there is a hissing when no sound is playing

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start by saying I only awarded 4 stars (so far) simply because I literally just took them out of the box, fitted them to my ears, and have them plugged in just to listen to music right now. I have not yet tested them on stage. However, I'm certain they will be successful in isolating sound well. I sat here while the music was streaming into my ears while just holding the volume button on ""up"" on another (loud) sound source and I could hear absolutely nothing apart from the music already playing through the headphones. I will say I did not prefer the foam ear plugs to the soft flex sleeves. I liked the easy installation the soft flex sleeves offer-and they were just more comfortable for me. To each his own...it's nice to have all the options. Plus it has a handy carrying case! Anyway, back to the headphone quality. I'm going to give them a major thumbs up!! Of course, they're a little heavy in comparison to products by MEElectric or Sony and that of the like. But one should expect that considering how they're made and etc. Do yourself a favor and make the investment if you plan to use them for more than just everyday music listening. I'm glad I did! I'll use them while I sing. If it helps, I also read other reviews where percussionists also recommended these for their own purposes. Enjoy!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio quality is abysmal for the Shure brand, even given the standards of in-ear headphones. Flat and tinny audio. Cable noise (as it hits the body with walking action) is extremely loud- something that should never occur with >$20 headphones.
If you wear glasses, they are near impossible to comfortably wear.
I find myself defaulting to my free pair of cellphone headphones just for the comfort factor."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"a few years ago I had a set of Shure E series ear buds, and they were great. I lost them somewhere and, so wanted to replace them, so i went with Shure again. Problems are twofold. ONe, These new ones have cheap foam and rubber ear pieces which don't stay in as well as the old silicone ones and don't block sound as well. Two: for some reason shure thought putting thick plastic sleeves on the wire closest to the ear would allow the user to mold the wire to fit over the ear. This would be great if they held the position, but they don't. they just make them hard to put on and uncomfortable to wear with glasses. they also seem to get tangled very easily when you put them away.

It's nice that sure decided to make the wires removeable for when they go bad and the pivot at the point of attachment would seem prevent the the metal fatigue that probably caused the older non-pivoting style to fail; but between the tangles, fall outs and discomfort I simply couldn't wear them for more than 15 min at a time. I just returned them."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now, I'll start by saying I'm not an audio-phile. I purchased these after doing research into in ear headphones that are both comfortable and sound good. I can honestly say that I am impressed. I ended up using the foam tips, as they seem to provide a better sound range than the silicone tips. I work in front of a computer all day and I was surprised how I can wear these for 4 hours straight and never have it irritate or hurt my ears.

They sound really well for me. I am a bit surprised because I wrote off in ear headphones as always not sounding very good. I'm pleasantly surprised with these.

My one con: the sizing on the foam tips included are a little odd. the smallest is slightly smaller than the middle and it is a slightly different shape. The large is a big jump in size from the middle. One of my ears works great for the middle size, and the other makes the middle size feel small. So I don't get a good fit with the middle size. The large size is almost too big for that ear. I use the large size, but it always feels a little odd when I first put them in.

I would recommend these for anyone that is looking for good quality in ear headphones and doesn't want to drop 300+ on really nice ones."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound is good I expected a larger soundstage
Everything feels so .. enclosed.
However, for it's price and size they are amazing earbuds.

Not they do need a little more power to make them better so if you dont have an amp it kinda limits the sound even more."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the good thing that I bought. One of driver died on me last year, lasted me for more than 4 years!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the Shure E2 ear buds and the wire was completely worn out after 4 years of use, which is understandable. I purchased these to replace the E2 set and there is not much of a difference. The overall design is slightly better, the ear buds are smaller and thinner causing less inner ear discomfort. The old ear tips do not fit on the new ear buds, but the new ear tips are very similar except now you don't have to fool with the sticky guard that never stayed in place anyway. The swivel feature on the ear buds is nice but it's hard to automatically realize which bud is right and which is left. I always have to look for the R or the L instead of just looking at them and knowing which is which like with the E2. The sound is slightly better than the E2 ear buds but that could also just be that they are new. Overall they are a nice upgrade from the E2 ear buds so if you are in the market for a new set of Shure ear buds buy these, you won't be disappointed."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality but the cord was cheaply made; falls out of my phones headphone jack and doesn't wrap around my ears properly.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice earphone, nice sound & comfortable to wear."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great earbuds. The sound quality is really nice (I am no audiophile) and I enjoy using them during my workday at my desk. The cord is fairly long which can be nice for running it down to a pants pocket and into a cell phone.
My one complaint about their design (and more broadly of other earbud designs as well) is that they tend to accumulate earwax in the small aperture. This, of course, obstructs the sound to your ear. It can be bothersome to remove the rubber earbud from the electronics, clear it out, and reinstall. There was one instance in which I was nervous that earwax would get past the rubber and into the earbud itself. Be careful about that!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for 90 and they are worth every penny. They isolate noise incredibly well, have great bass, and stay in place with a bendable wire that wraps around your ear. Only problem is people try to talk to you and you can not hear them at all."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!!! Good bass and isolating.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Major durability issue. Returning the product.

After 2 days or so, left sound start cutting depending on the position of the cable. Don't think I would trust Shure again."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great for playing live as in ear monitors. Just make sure to adjust the wires right so they don't make your ears sore after practice!
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If the cord didn't keep breaking requiring a new one almost every year, these would be the perfect headphones."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed some good headphones for drumming and practice.
They have great isolation depending on the ear foam you use.
And my ears are no longer ringing when i'm done with my gigs.
Quality is great!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fit isn't so great, especially the part that wraps around your ears. Inferior to Westone but the cable is replaceable."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not well balanced sound. To expensive for what you get.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every musician should have one of these, now i can hear everything in a very peaceful way when im playing live, they have great bass response and high end too, they look very durable, and the detachable cable its an awesome feature."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are good quality. Only negative is the buds are too big for my very small ear canals. An optional size bud available would be nice.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are very comfortable and produce very good quality.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is decent. This is NOT what you want if you love bass-heavy earbuds
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The cable started stripping after less than a month of use. Sound quality is amazing, but the wires not coming apart is not so great."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound amazing... much better the the ones that came with my shure in ear monitor system.... Much more comfortable too!

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was great never fall off sound quality was good for its prise especially for female voice
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the SE215 they are well worth the price and the best in ear headphones in its price range. I suggest reading the manual before doing anything as these headphones need a little practice before putting it on.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is... Wow. As a rule I am a bit of an audio snob. I bought these as a replacement for my gym beaters - ancient Shures (SE205 I think). They had taken a beating, even though they still sounded very good. But these sound absolutely amazing... honestly they made me think ""Why do I even have the SE535 for my snobby, more concentrated listening?""... This is amazing value for the buck, and simply an amazingly extremely well rounded piece of gear. Sublime sound - make sure you fit them well every time, and enjoy. They provide every acoustic nuance and resolution you need.

They are not as immediately comfy as other stuff, but the sound quality is worth investing the extra time in the fitting. Every second of it. I think these are the best in-ears for the buck on the planet. By a big lead. I also own the 535s, and honestly... if these new 215s were my only set I'd be just fine."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for noise reducing headphones that were not $400 and but worth owning. This by far is the best deal out there right now. I searched far and wide as I play acoustic drums but love the ability to play along with music in the background if not live on stage. This works perfect and is essentially like having full foam ear plugs in with the ability to hear the music cleanly throug a monitor.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of Klipsch S4's before these and thought I would try something else based on tech website reviews and although the sound quality is good, they are awful for working out. I don't run or jog or do anything too active just weight lifting and I'm constantly adjusting these. Switching out multiple tips don't seem to make a difference. I'll more than likely go back to the S4's or try something else."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,if youre willing to shell out the money these are amazing buds. they are tough as nails (compared to must ear buds) and ive never had this level of bass from a speaker so small. truly a great purchase.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earphones for the price.like I mean they sound really good.you buy these you will have no regrets.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, the cord it's too long and heavy."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product works better than expected. I have bout 4 of these for gifts and everyone agrees they work exceptionally well.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had these less than a week and the right side stopped working all together.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great while they lasted. I used these for my headphones while riding my motorcycle. One, day I got a coughing sound from one earbud and now only one side works. What a waste of money."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them looking forward to being able to hear my own mix and singing in key for a change.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The bluetooth portion could be better. To skip a song or to replay it, you press and hold the volume up or down. I'd much prefer double taps than a long press. Also, i can't seem to have it go back one song, instead of replaying the same one. The worst part is how long it takes to call up Siri. You have to hold the play/pause button until it beeps. Then you wait until you hear the Siri tones. That's way too long to wait.

The quality of the earpieces is very nice. I feel its a bit overpriced though."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Shure earphones for a decade and these are the best so far. They make a very tight seal in the ear to block out noise and the sound quality is excellent.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these things. I will be happier after i can find a set of tips that will last longer than 2 weeks.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great and they block enough outside noise that I'm not deaf at the end of the night.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as expected and pretty comfortable as well.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got my Shure SE215-K headphones today and oh my! I must say I was a bit turned off by the packaging. It look as though it was something I would buy at Best Buy. Don't be fooled though, once inside the package I was greeted with warning galore. I like warnings. Hearing loss etc. Ok maybe these are some serious headphones.

I got them out, put the ear pieces that fit me best and gave them a shot. I figured the style would be uncomfortable and yes it takes a second to get used to inserting them but once in I can barely tell they are there, it's like having the wings of an angel fluttering aside your head.

Let me tell you, I'm not an audiophile but I love music as much as the next person. I'm very particular about the balance I like. I like sharp tones from techno but also massive bass drop from dub step style music. These headphones are perfect. The bass doesn't overpower everything but on a song that's designed to push its there enough bass to bring a huge smile to your face. Music is crisp and clear. I didn't know crisp music until I listened to these. Each note is perfectly placed in your ear for an eventual eargasim.

The sound canceling is amazing. My previous headphone (Monster Turbines) I used for years and was so happy with until they came up missing. They blocked sound so well from their metal construction. I was worried with the Shure being what looks like plastic but let me tell you, with them in and no music sound is about 50/60% cut. The second any music is played all and you could be in the middle of a Gettysberg reenactment and never know it.

I've tried a few different genres and have yet to find anything these headphones don't perform spectacularly with. I'm well pleased, I can't begin to say how amazing these headphones really are, seriously, they are really that good.

I would recommend these to anyone who wishes to have some amazing sound, and are particular of the quality of the music they listen to."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, take a little getting used to with the wire wrapping back over your ear but I have no complaints."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a owner of an Audio Technica MTH 50, these are perfect in ear headphones. They are worn over the ear, which may be an issue for some. Overall, the quality is amazing, but one may not like how they fit in one's ears."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. You really can't beat the price on these for how good they sound.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am long time owner of SE215's and was excited to try the BT1 version. Audio quality is superb and it can pump out a lot of volume, but the product has a major design flaw. The volume adjustment steps are way too large, and the minimum volume is much too loud. Even at the minimum possible volume, some audio is uncomfortably loud. The problem is that you turn the volume down one more step, it is off! Contacted Shure tech support and received a response that basically told me they don't care. There is no firmware update available or planned. No fix for the volume problem available."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent. Good quality and clarity.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounds, would definitely recommend and purchased them again."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down the best earphones for under $100. These are awesome for use as an IEM on stage or just for listening. I use them in class and on the bus aswell as on stage. They're awesome.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once you figure out how to put them on, these earphones are easily the most comfortable and durable I have ever used. Highly recommended."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the $100 price range, these are the ones to get. I'm in a Prayer House and use them 4-5 days a week."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these on a whim for my commuting and running. The noise isolation is impressive. I find they sound better and are more comfortable than my last Bose ie2 pair. Overall a good purchase if they are in your price range.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say this model has been doing pretty well in terms on sound quality so far. The only problem I have with it is it's kinda hard to take out the ear buds to change them.

It's good in the sense they don't fall off easily, but bad in the sense it's too good that I couldn't take it out=="
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my new Shure SE 215-k for several weeks now and I like them better than the first pair that I got 4 years ago (they finally broke). The fit is far superior, more secure than before. The cable is a little stiff compared to the previous set, but it should make them last longer."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,What are the best earbuds I have ever on takes awhile for it to be comfortable but other than that it sounds amazing
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and rugged.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought and am loving it. Had the Klipsch S4's before. Although the sound quality was great, the comfort was terrible and the quality of the wires were bad. After one year of use, the right ear stopped working. Tried the Bose MIE2 at the store. The fit was awkward and was not noise isolating. The quality was only good when you pressed the earbuds into your ear.

I like pros/cons list, so this is how I'm going to do my review for the Shure se215

Pros:
-For this class and price range of in ear headphones, absolutely amazing sound quality. Crisp sounds, great bass.
-Was skeptical of the different fit. However, it conforms to your ears very well. The tips are also more foamy than rubbery which creates a nice comfortable fit
-Wires are replaceable! GENIUS!

Cons:
-The wire is a bit bulky and long. This could become annoying if I had to store in jeans pocket, etc. But I guess it's a tradeoff for durability

I also bought the iPhone mobile accessory. Although a bit steep at $50, I think it's worth it. Great functionality (volume, next/last track, forward, play/pause). The cable is also shorter (but a still a little bulky).

Bottom Line: After a lot of research and debate, I am very satisfied with my purchase."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So far for me, they haven't lived up to the hype, but still a good choice for listening."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Seems like a well-built product probably very durable and long-lasting but sound quality seems to be lacking had to send them back going to go back with Sennheiser

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a follower of Shure Headphones for several years and wouldn't trade them in for any other headphones.

ke"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as much bass as I'm used to, but then again, it is due to the well balanced frequency response. Highs are very easily discernible and overall less muddled then comparably priced units. I do wish it had more bass though."

The fact the cord is replacable is fantastic."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These look like nice headphones, but I received them and only one of the wires worked properly to provide audio. I switched the ear buds to see if it was them but both worked properly on the one working wire so it seems to be a defect. It's a shame because the ear buds seem like they would be comfortable, but I have no confidence these would not break easily. Probably not worth getting these if there are more reliable brands."

Comfort isn't its best suit. Hard to put the earphones on for the first week. Plastic earhook cause chaffing and a small wound on the back of my earlobes."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,these work well if you play the drums. They sound good and they do really well at blocking out the sound of your drums.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This the is second pair of Shure earbuds I have owned. The first pair (don't remember the model) I bought about 8 years ago for about $150 and the sound was incredible. I lost the earbuds, so naturally thought that these SE215 would fill in the void. Well, these are not even close to the one's I lost. This review is not based on the old Shure earbuds I lost.

The quality of the SE215 very good, but that does not equate to the sound these earbuds produce. The sound quality is not much better than the ear buds that came with my cellphone. The bass is poor, the mid's is average. Not what I expected from Shure. I think if you are going to spend $100 on a pair of earbuds, shop around, these are not worth the money."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,did not come with carrying case or any extra tips. Came packaged in a plastic bag. After buying some after market foam tips they sound great.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, beautiful range, and once broken in after a few days, very comfortable. If you're looking for good quality headphones with a great sound for fairly cheap, these are great. Also, great for playing video games"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great, but this shape of earphones really just isn't for me. Personally, I find them difficult to put on. It's a two hand job. You have to route the stiff part of the wire around the top of your ears, while using another hand to place each side into your ears. If you're using the (included) foam tips, it almost requires a third hand to smoosh the foam down to fit into your ears.

Even after doing all that, they just didn't stay in well, at all. Yes, I tried all the sizes of tips, and both the foam and silicone ones. It's just no fun walking around with only one side actually playing any audio, since the other side keeps pushing itself out.

I went back to a pair of Sennheiser earbuds I had before."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For $99 you can do a lot worse. Truly. There are so many products out there that hype themselves as standing out from the crowd, being something unique (using wood housing instead of plastic, I won't mention any specific names but I can assure you they don't sound as good as these. I've tried them, believe me). These are absolutely phenomenal earbuds at their price point. The drivers are lively and separated but not shrill and cold which is often the case with balanced well separated headphones. They are neutral and give a perfectly balanced presentation of the music you are listening to but also give a lively and impacting presentation. A total joy to use. Any EQ tweaking will only make them sound inferior and bring out the weakness of whatever program you are using to alter the EQ. These are really quite good. Speaking as a person who has owned Sennheiser 650 HD with a $500 headphone tube amp. These are really the best headphones in their price category.

I am not a Shure fanboy. Actually. My first pair of shure, e2c broke with light use. I had sworn them off (hence my foray into wood housed and otherwise earbuds, which is why I am giving you a highly appraised review despite my previous bad experience) but back with the 215k and I am really very satisfied. They are sturdy headphones. The cords are very robust. The quality is high. And I can't give you any faults. They are really very good and I would recommend them to anyone looking for earbuds in this price category.

As an added bonus you won't have to hear any boneheads when you are on the bus or otherwise. They are really very good at blocking outside noises. Like, totally block any outside noise under 100db. Love these earbuds. They are really the best in this price range and you can't go wrong if you chose them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I arrived at these I owned, urBeats , Bose Sound True, Sennhieser Momentums, and a small pair of Monster earbuds. upbeats was a good product. I didn't mind them. Sound True was horrible for the price tag. I have to have a ear bud that complete fits in your ear and seals in the sound. They were horrible for that. urBeats provided great sound, but during working out, they often started to get loose. My Momentums are awesome but I have to say an over the ear headphone isn't ideal for lifting to me. Personal preference. Great headphones for movies and casual listening for sure. Before these headphones the Monsters were ultimately best sound for the price tag out of all the above.

FINALLY, I rolled the dice on another pair of earbuds, us sure of the lever the ear wire, how they might fit, great name in sound but am I buying a name and not sound? Lastly the price difference between these and the higher is extreme, am I even getting something worth it?

What has resulted is easily hands down the BEST earbud I have ever owned. to date. The ear piece is made of ear plug type foam, you squeeze them and lt them settle in your ear and they aren't going ANYWHERE during ANYTHING! (If you talk in the gym more than workout, you won't like these, quick remove isn't happening.) These are great for the person going into the gym and there to ignore everyone and just workout in your own zone. The wire around the ear? A few reviews said it took some breaking in. Not for me, I formed them to my ears first time and they feel GREAT.

SOUND. The sound is unbelievably amazing. You know that equalizer on your phone? You can actually use that and tell the difference significantly with these earbuds. You want bass? OK, You want low bass? They work well with that too. These earbuds are simply amazing. For this price tag I can speak from owning a few different brands that these are hands down are a STEAL from Shure. They could charge more for this kinda sound and isolation. If you a questioning the money, DON'T, if you are questioning the comfort, I am a huge snob on comfort and they are amazing. POWER? check check and check. Don't hesitate on pulling the trigger on these. My best amazon purchase and it's not even close."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update to the review. I have been using these headphones now for a few more weeks. The more i use them, the more i appreciate them. The sound is clean. It is critical to get the right fit using the various sizes of buds. I used the rubber ones, not the foam ones for a dramatic difference in performance. I want to reiterate how well these are made. They seem to be very high quality and the cord engineering is supreme. There are so many ear buds where the cord breaks in one fashion or the other and you have to throw them out. This actually has a replaceable cord. However, the cord itself is a heavier gauge which gives it a very solid feel and it does not tangle easily like thinner cords. The jack is heavier duty also than most ear buds i have seen. The sounds seems quite detailed and not bass heavy. The efficiency and volume are fine now that i got the right fit. I have not heard the higher end Shure's to know if there is an appreciable difference in the sound, but these sound quite good compared to some Bose ear-buds i have and Dre Beats which i think are too bass heavy.

I have been using the buds for a couple of weeks now. I have Bose ones and some cheaper Dr Beats I got with HTC phone. At first I was quite disappointed with these phones. The low end was largely missing and when plugged into my laptop volume was poor. Then I started playing around with the different buds in the kit. This made a huge difference. I ended up using the rubber med ones. It dramatically changed the sound from the foam ones. These buds provide good detailed sound. The bass end is decent but not heavy if you like that. The Beats provide a much better low-end but are not as nuanced and detailed as these in my view. I think these provide a bit better sound than the Bose and are more isolating. So all in all these are good buds. My only issue was whether it was worth the money to step up to the 315's or higher in their line.

One more thing, I was impressed with the connecting wires on these. They are independent units. They are of a heavier quality wire and seem to be higher quality than I have found on other buds. If they should ever break, you can probably just buy a new cable and not have to throw out the entire product which is what usually happens. I think this is a great innovation."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to drop $100 on a pair of ear buds, fearing they would not live up to my expectations. However, I'm pleased to report that they exceeded them. These are bar none the most comfortable, and best sounding earbuds I've ever owned. If it weren't for the cable (unavoidable with any wired headphones). But to their credit, way the cable loops over your ear makes the headphones both very comfortable and very secure. When you have the right size of nib selected, they don't move, loosen, fall out, or fatigue your ears, even when moving actively (working out, working, etc). I mainly bought them to wear while delivering papers to rooms at the hotel I work at, which is a tedious task, but it would often make my previous pair of ear buds fall out, but I found myself using them constantly. The memory foam nibs are fantastic, comfortable, and seal your ear from outside noise for an outstanding acoustic experience.
Pros: Excellent sound quality
very clear highs and lows, strong (but still clear) mids
warm sound
comfortable
Well constructed - cable quality is nice, and ear buds are solid with no vibrations, rattle, or noise
Detachable cable
Comes with case, cleaning tool (for the inevitable earwax invasion) and a plethora of ear nibs.
nice, gold plated, right angle 3.5mm plug
fantastic for planes, trains, road trips, relaxing, jogging/excessive, etc

Cons: Chord is not braided, just rubber insulated, however it is very robust feeling.
would have been nice to have a microphone and/or an inline volume control, but not a deal breaker by any means.
Having these headphones in makes you absolutely oblivious to any other sound outside of what you're listening to - it blocks out noise that well. Use with caution, wouldn't recommend for situations when you still need to be able to hear some stuff even with the headphones in, although that's sort of a given.

Final thoughts: These are not cheap headphones, and the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is absolutely true here. Having owned a pair of the beats ear buds (which ironically were half again as much) I can tell you these are a much better product. Comfortable, clear, dynamic sound, and intuitive design. You can't go wrong buying these headphones. I use them with a FiiO E6 amp because it's Equalizer is much better than my phone's built in equalizer, but an amp is not by any means required."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For in ear headphones. these are by far the best. im a huge adiophile when it comes to loud music. Im a big fan of the cambridge soundworks bookshelfs speakers hooked up to my denon. I have some bose and beyer headphones that are over ear stereo types. and these are for when i travel.

first part, the headphones come apart from the actual cord. why is this good? well when your cord wears out or it gets cut somehow, you dont need a new pair, you just need the cord.

The hadphones if put in properly with the wire around the ear, are phenomenal and even hours of plane use from NYC to london, these wont hurt your ears

The bass and just overall quality of the sound is superior. I also can blast them in a public area without anyone around me hearing a thing

i had a pair of the 435s or something and my puppy at the time chewed those up. since i have bought these and they sound amazing as well. GO FOR IT."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones which I use constantly. Sound quality is definitely amazing. I suggest when you try to get those factory buds off, work from the bottom. You must get a very good grip and when you try to pull them off try to twist a bit as well. For some reason that tricked worked for me and I'm a guy so I don't have cool fingernails like the ladies. Other than that they work perfectly, look great, and just take some time getting used to(weird shape). Also, another tip for when you put them on. If you want to be really snug in your ear, take your hand opposite to the earbud your going to put on and lift the tip of your ear while you place the ear-bud in. This trick worked like a charm for me so I'm just sharing some random tips. Well, I highly recommend these earphones. Their very popular among artist and you can't beat the quality! Enjoy everyone, I'm ""shure"" you will!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones are good in-ear headphones. After some tweaking of the wires and understanding how they best fit in my ears, they performed really well. I recently traveled via the train and these headphones cut out all the noise of the train and most conversations surrounding me.

These headphones are best used while looping over the year and they fit snug in the ear cavity much like professional in-ear monitor headphones used by professional singers without the multi-thousand dollar price tag.

The headphones have a great sound and deliver a beautiful and dynamic range within your ears. The bass is measured appropriately in comparison to the mid and high ranges. The words of your music cut through music with clarity and give the customer a great listening experience.

These in-ear monitors do have a little learning curve to them since they sit more into the ear cavity then other headphones, but if you want a great listening experience and can afford the price tag then you should consider the Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Boomy bass bleeds into the lower midrange. Fun for a few songs but annoying in many as well. If you're used to extra bass, though, you might not notice it.

Comparing against my SE210, the SE215 had a harsh sibilance (the ""ssss"" sound for voices) and yet violins, cymbals, etc. sounded just as muffled as they did in the SE210. A sine sweep found a loud peak around 4.3 kHz. It's a heck of a lot of sibilance for $100+ audio. Everything above 5 kHz is rolled off as it was in my SE210.

You could equalize these, but if you're going to equalize you may as well get a decent pair of $20 earbuds and equalize those instead. Just flatten any offending peaks, and you'll probably end up with something just as good as the raw SE215 if not better. Equalizer APO + Room Eq Wizard work well in Windows."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, the main reason that I wanted Bluetooth capability is because I travel A LOT! The cord always seems to get in the way. I wanted something that I didn't have to worry about recharging for at least 10 hours, but figured 8 would be acceptable. My flights, including lay overs, are generally about 12-14 hours so I figured that I could recharge while waiting on my connecting flight. When I first received the bluetooth cable, I charged it up completely. I wanted to know about how long I could play music before they would quit. By the way, I already had a pair of SE535's, so that's what I would be using. Anyway, paired them up to my Samsung phone with no problems and started the music. Long story short, they played for an astounding 13 1/2 hours!!!!! These are advertised for playing music for 8 hrs. and taking 1 1/2 hours to recharge. If you do deplete the cord completely it will take a little over 2 hours to recharge which is absolutely acceptable to me. Overall, like all Shure products, this thing outperforms it's claims! I am absolutely thrilled with this (as with all Shure products), because I don't have to sacrifice music quality and I don't have to worry about recharging in the middle of my travels. By the way, once you go past about the 12 hr. mark you will begin to get an audible ""battery low"" warning. I am a very happy customer!!!!"

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my previous pair of 425s and bought these as a replacement (hoping to find the others). I didn't expect the sound to be on the same level and it isn't. It is worth the money.

My chief complaint is the stink and stifness of the cable. I mean wicked bad order. My 425s had a black cable and maybe if you ordered the 215s in black that wouldn't be a problem. Looking at buying just a black cable would set me back $30. So I'm stuck with the wretched things. My option at this point is to send them back and buy the black version and hope that doesn't smell to high heaven."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these to use as a keyboardist and vocalist for my church's worship team. I appreciate that thiese earphones come with multiple size and type ear buds and also a cleaning tool. I have been careful to store these well and never drop them so I can't report on their durability over multiple falls. But I have had them for quite awhile and they are still just as good as new. I've also used these during air travel and they are extremely helpful in blocking noise in airplaines and in airports. I would highly recommend the Shure SE215's as an entry level in-ear monitor. These are far superior to other ear buds and the fit is very secure for multiple size ear canals.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is definitely worth it.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these so much. When I have them in I seriously cannot hear any outside noise and I love that. The quality is superb and I recommend buying these.

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215 are very, very nice and worth every cent! Fantastic well balanced sound and well thought out and balanced as well.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds to run and workout at the gym. These are awkward to put on but I am used to wearing the wire over my ear (have done so for years with this brand and another). The problem with this particular pair of earbuds is that the cord is very stiff so when it curves over the ear, the rigidity bothers the outside of my ear. It is Ok for 5-10 minutes but then after that, it becomes super duper uncomfortable. I have tried to not curve it around my ear but they are not designed to be worn that way so it doesn't work (they fall out). I have tried various ways of bending the wire so it doesn't keep rubbing me in the same spot... Nope. I give up. Too bad, the sound quality and noise cancelling is pretty good. Maybe it is just how my ears are shaped, I don't know. But I figured I would write this review in case it helps someone. Had the cord been more flexible or not as thick, it would probably have been fine."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very dissatisfied with these pairs of headphones. I am not an audiophile but I was hoping for a pair that offers decent quality and a considerable build, but what I got was something else.
Pros:
Long cable for tall people or place it in the backpack and it'll be fine.
Con:
Sound nearly identical like the earphones that come with the iPhone except slight bass boost.
Uncomfortable ear design unless you have ears like dumbo. Tried all the sizes and I have an average ear size.
Wires that go around your ear won't stay in place.I had to constantly bend the wire, which is meant to do that, in order to keep it in place.
The little pouch it comes with is worthless, it broke when I was headed to the the airport just by walking and having it hooked to my belt making me loose the headphones

Please becareful of this earphone. I highly do not recommend them"

But the sound is great. Very well-balanced. With the foam earpieces, all sorts of stuff could be happening outside and I wouldn't notice.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My current favorite headphones are my over the ear Audeze LCD2s, which I generally listen to at home or work with my Meridian Explorer DAC. I've been in the market, however, for some decent in ear monitors (IEMs) for fitness use. While the greatest audio fidelity possible is a far greater concern than cost for me when listening at home, I'm willing to sacrifice some quality when exercising if it saves a few hundred dollars because I'm generally listening to lower quality compressed files stored on my phone or streaming from Amazon Prime Music anyways. By no means did I expect to find a pair of IEMs equivalent to my LCD2s at any price point; I think I'd have better luck seeing my Prius outpace a Ferrari. What I wanted (and arguably needed) was something that didn't constantly leave me on the verge of losing my gym membership for randoming shouting obscenities at the pitiful sound quality of my current gym IEMs. Besides that, I needed a pair of IEMs that could stay securely in place while bearing a hurricane load of sweat and movement.

I fruitlessly reviewed every ""sport"" earbud on the market and found largely disappointing reviews. It then dawned on me that stage musicians sweat like ecstasy junkies at a rave in Death Valley and their IEMs always seem to stay in place. Altering my search queries, I quickly found the Shure SE215 and related higher end models. At this point in my buying habits I generally convince myself that money is no object and buy the highest end model of a given item. Still being slightly hesitant of their long term durability in harsh environmental conditions and bearing the knowledge that they'd be often left in areas much more labile to theft than my LCD2s (e.g., my car), I convinced myself to start low and work my way up the price ladder until I found what I desired.

Needless to say, my search stopped at the SE-215. These headphones offer easily 60-70% the quality of my Audeze LCD2s at roughly 10% the cost. That's a sacrifice worth making in my opinion. Like many others have recommended here, you should try all the supplied ear tips provided to get the best fit and sound. I've had equal success with the foam and rubber/silicone(?) tips staying in place during vigorous exercise, but I feel the bass response is exponentially better with the rubber tips. Additionally, these IEMs definitely benefit from some burn in time.

A word of warning to outdoor athletes, these definitely isolate you to a great degree from external noise. I'm still hesitant to run in congested traffic areas with more than minimal volume because of this.

So long story short if you require some secure IEMs that withstand any degree of sweat and movement and provide decent enough sound quality to keep you pumped up through your workout, the SE-215 do not disappoint. And keep in mind saying these are decent is a strong compliment considering I'm used to listening to a $1000+ pair of cans with a dedicated DAC at home."

The highs and the soundstage are what I find issues with. These headphones provide a more narrow soundstage, so the music generally stays in the center of your head. The highs are also muffled or have a veil. The right ear piece did a bit of crackling but by moving it around I got it to stop.

I decided to purchase this earphone based on many internet reviews and I'm very glad i did it. The sound quality is superb compared to my last earphone and the noise isolating is fantastic. Im using it right now, wile I'm studying and my neighbors are not disturbing me anymore. It is good to listen classic music, Hip-Hop, electronic, rock'n roll, reggae, etc.
One of my main goals was to turn down my music volume, specially wile I'm at the gym (they put the environment sound to loud) cause i don't want to be deaf. Mission accomplished!! Its working perfectly. I can run or workout and set the volume beneath 20% (using my iPod nano 6th generation). It is not coming out wile I'm running and the sweating is not a problem anymore.
The only con is the comfort of wearing it. Despite being way better than the iPhone earphones still a earphone so it take a wile till you get used to it.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great bass, just a little difficult to change the sleves, and the cable is like easly breakable. But everything else is just perfect!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several sets of Shure ear buds. The sound is always good and the noise isolation is effective too. I am still pleased with the sound quality and noise isolation of these ear buds. The problem for me is the shape. They are kind of flat and nestle into the ear. However, particularly in my right ear, they bump up against a bone and become uncomfortable in about 1 hour. I'm sure they are fine for some people, but I wish Shure would return to the old ear bud shape."

Used it 5 days, and one side is broken.
The wire is really bad.
Don't buy it, not worth it."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing IEMs. Worth every penny. Sweet sound signature, great comfort for an IEM, great isolation .Soundstage is nice too. Sturdy build quality. Cables are not flimsy at all. Overall, it is a great product from shure."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to try these since I read good reviews about them. They sound pretty good. The bass is good, but the mids are slightly muddy which causes it to sound a little distant and muffled. Despite that I would have love to have kept them because they are better than a lot of other earbuds. However, trying to the replace the eartips is a pain! I followed the manufactures suggestion to freeze the entire earbuds (yes you read that right freeze the electronics, but not for the 24 hours the manufacturer suggested) It worked, however, after they warm up the eartips get to tight again again. After couple of eartip swaps, literally 3 hours after I opened the box, the plastic nozzle connecting the earbud to the eartip broke off. I can't justify replacing this item since the plastic is so brittle."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you ride a motorcycle and would like to listen to music while not losing your hearing due to wind noise and excessive volume these earpieces are for you. I purchased them simply because my previous pair of earbuds broke due to an intensive cleaning by the washing machine and was not looking for real sound isolation at the time. When I first put them in though I could hear nothing going on around me, they keep out noise better than the foam earplugs I have floating around the garage. They sit inside of your ear and don't stick out horizontally like some earbuds do and I had to try put my helmet on as I had been looking for a way to hear music on the road for a while. They. Fit. Perfectly. They don't fall out, the volume is great, and it keeps wind noise at a minimum. This all depends on helmets of course but I have a Shoei Qwest helmet and no windscreen. I have not tried riding above 70 MPH but anything up to that point seems to work. If you have a windscreen on your bike I am sure the results would be even better."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound good if you can get them in your ears and have them stay there. The fit and shape of these is now pretty outdated. They are supposed to go around the back of your ear and drop down, but that makes them uncomfortable. The design makes them look like hearing aids. The sound is better than most earbuds, with a pretty flat frequency curve and decent low end bass, almost to subwoofer levels."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love them ..they are awesome!!
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update, my left earbud stopped working. It seems the connection went bad and its not the wire but the earbud part. Now I have to send this in for repair. Not a very well constructed earbud because they are so fragile.

I had the old Shure headphones from back in 2006 that finally broke at the connector so I needed a new replacement. These sound great with a good balance of sound. Overall sound is much better than my old pair. The wire that goes over the ear is cumbersome, I'm still not used to it but once you bend the wire near the ear and cinch the rubber thing up its secure. I expect the speaker part to last awhile, and if the wire goes bad you just have to replace that part which is great. Approved."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loveD the sound, and the fit, but if it works less than a year it's just not of very well made."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Today I heard my music for the first time. Apparently, I've tolerated bad headphones for far too long. I listened to Knifes ""Silent Shout"" on the train ride home tonight and I wanted to hand the phones to other passengers and say ""you've got to hear this!"" I'm a Shure evangelist from this point forward."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been through at least 15-20 pair of in-ear headphones over the past decade or so. Over the past couple of years I'd settled into my all-time favorite -- the Grado iGis -- but decided to try out a new pair after losing those and being unable to grab a new pair because they've been constantly sold out here on Amazon. This is a solid pair of headphones in terms of construction and overall sound quality, but the lack of definition in the highs and the harshness in the high mids leave much to be desired. I also found that the wideness of the stereo field is a bit shallower than the iGis and other buds that I've owned at the same price point. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the design element that requires you to wrap the cords behind your ears. There was also an issue getting these to output sound from both ears when I plugged it into my iPhone 5s, although it worked fine plugged in to the 3.5mm jack on my macbook pro, so I'm not sure if it's meant to be compatible with the 5s. Looks like I'll have to continue my search for some good (hopefully temporary) iGi replacements."

He says they have good bass sound too. Did mention the different end piece sizes run a little big, but they came with a size that fit well still."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these in February of 2014. They sound great, but around September, one earphone and then the other began to short out. Eventually one was completely dead. I returned them for repair in October. It's now August of 2015. I've had the repaired headphones and the left one is beginning to short out again. I'll give them one more shot at repair, but it seems to me that the way the cable wraps around the back of the ear will put stress on the connection. Seems like an inherent design flaw that may cause some of these to short out.

The cheaper headphone, SE112, has a different connection design and may not be impacted. All of the more expensive Shure models seem to have the same design."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked great the first year until I noticed a tear in the plastic where it molds to your ear. I decided to get them fixed and found out I had to pay for shipping. As long as they were fixed I didn't mind. When I received them back, they only worked for a few weeks until one side of the earphones stopped working. I had to ship them again (thankfully for free this time) and wait another couple of weeks. I received them again only to find out one side was broken again when I put them on! This is my third time within the past few months that I have to get it fixed. I am not impressed with the longevity of this product and don't recommend it unless you want to go through the hassle of continuously sending them for repair. It's unfortunate that I know that the cable is what's broken and yet they require me to send the whole product in. Other brands like sol republic send you new ones free of charge without the hassle of having to ship your earphones. Also I encountered a rude person in repair services that told me my shipping slip would come that day but ended up coming a couple of days later. I am not happy with this brand or product."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've worn these for over a month now and I'm still not used to the over-ear set up. I wear glasses and tend to wear my hair down at work so it's always a pain to put them on and take them off when I need to go to the printer and walk away from my desk. If the sound quality was better I wouldn't mind the tradeoff but it feels like my Klipsch S4's have more noticeable sound qualities than these Shure's do. If I were to get a do-over, I would get the Bose earbuds instead of these since they're around the same pricepoint"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these so I could use my Shure 535's wirelessly. It was easy to pair with an iMac, but the audio quality is horrendous. It manages to make my lossless iTunes library sound worse than telephone hold music. It sounded better when paired with an iPhone, but still not great. From the Shure website: ""The RMCE-BT1 uses the SBC codec, which is neither high resolution nor low-latency."" So it's not possible to use higher quality codecs (AAC or aptX) with this Bluetooth adapter, you're basically stuck with phone call quality audio."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sounds of these headphones. The only complaint I have is if the plug twists in the jack slightly there is a brief sound disconnect. I've observed this on some other higher-quality headphones/earphones, so maybe it's to be expected."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Their wires are thicker and I like that you can replace these earplugs if the wires get smashed or torn. The sound is good but they can be a challenge to put in your ear.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These paired with a high quality mp3 player, gives you ear candy. Despite being small in-ears they pack a lot of good sound and some bass. Great buy. :)"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an audio enthusiast I have used many sets of headphones from Sennheiser, Bose, Beats, etc. But these Shure earphones/sound monitors are the best I've used so far. They fit comfortably after getting used to and don't look ridiculous but rather inconspicuous. Overall great earphones. 5 Star rating from me."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great, and the buds stay in my ears because of the moldable wire that attaches to my ears even while running. I put them in and don't have to touch them once."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are AWESOME!!! Only complaint I have is that the sleeves that actually go in the ear are a bit hard to get off, but since you shouldn't be changing them every hour anyways its not a problem."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't expecting the bass to be as good and was going to eventually get a pair of dual drivers. These convinced me that I'm fine with single-drivers. Great product.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't recommend these, because they won't use either the AAC codec (which seems like it should be supported) or the aptX codec (which isn't supported by the bluetooth cable) on macOS. Possible they use the AAC codec on iOS and would sound good there, but the SBC codec that gets used on macOS is noticeably worse than ACC/aptX.

Pairing was easy and build quality is great. They are a beautiful looking pair of earphones. If they supported the aptX codec these would probably be the top bluetooth earphone at this price point.

I had high hopes - figured they'd at least be able to use AAC. I'll be returning these and holding out to try the MA750 wireless."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. When my $350 monitors stopped working, I got these.

If you want to listen to the music you must buy one, and if you just want to hear the music don't buy them, seriously, you will just complain about something not right...... I am glad to spend $100 for a QUALITY! Absolutely Love them !!!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't really used them yet for the intent of stage monitors, but when listening with my laptop music, they are really nice. Takes a little adjustment to get them just right in your ear, but overall, seems like high quality at an affordable price."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before getting these I had Klipsch Image S4's, which I loved but were not that well built. The headphone jack on them came lose making them useless, after only 7 months of use. The Shure's are much better built, with a strong, thick (but not cumbersome) cord. The heads also swivel on the cable meaning that they don't get tangled. The way you put them on seems weird at first (in, then up, over, and down the back of your ear) but you get used to it quickly, it's very comfortable, and it seems almost impossible that they could fall out.

Sound quality seems to be around the same as the Klipsch, but I do think that vocals sound a little crisper, and they tend to emphasis little things (like soft high-hats or piano in the background of a song) that I never noticed with the Klipsch. All in all, they're a great, and I would probably buy from Shure again."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,best earbuds ever - worth the price
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass, full, round sound - overall much better value for money than the Etymotics so if you don't need precise sound and tonal clarity in the mids and highs, these are the phones for you"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound like a quality Shure product, but I find them too uncomfortable to wear. No, I'm not wearing them with the cord sticking out as if they were iPhone earphones. I simply find the body to be unnecessarily large such that it puts pressure on some parts of my outer ear. This becomes painful after just an hour. The cables also have a very thick plastic jacket that is not very pliable. They do have a beefier connector between the earphone body and cable than my Westone UM Pro30s which I like."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They arrived on time and are perfect. they stay in my ears and don't fall out. Took a bit of getting used to to put them in.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,these earphones have been great for the gym. they are comfortable and have a durable construction. i would recommend these for anyone looking for comfy earbuds that stay in your ears.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a good pair of headphones pretty good but they aren't going to sound good on there own. I had to plug them into an amp to get them to sound the way I thought a $100 pair of headphones should sound. They just weren't loud enough for me and to bass was differently not as good as I expected after doing some research on them before I bought them. I also took away another star because one of the cushions that came installed on the headphones was smashed and it still hasn't popped back out to normal and I'm not sure if it will (its the medium sized one and those are the ones that fit my ears the best).

Maybe I like something different than other people in my headphone because I have some Nuforce NE-600X that I got from mass drop for like $10 and I think they sound better off my phone without the amp. If I would have tried the SE215s before buying them I might not have bought them cause I don't think they are worth the price.

I might return them but I'm going to keep using them for a few more days to see if I change my mind."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my Shure SE215-K in Singapore today and i have to say that the sound is warm and i can hear a lot of minor details which i could not in the stock iPhone earphones. However, the cables are too long and slightly heavy."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, these sound great, but the way they fit in your ear is a bit awkward. I would prefer something more straight forward."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these have a wonderful sound to them. It took a bit to get the perfect fit with these, but that seems to be the norm for me on any in-ears that are not molds. I think that these are toward the top of the list in my mind for in-ears at this price point. I am also always very happy with Shure's cable quality across their entire range. These things last!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I put these on some 535's and can honestly say this is the first Shure product I was actually disappointed in. The microphone in this is horrible, you cannot use it anywhere that has any background noise because it picks up every sound. The mic has no noise canceling what so ever.
The voice that announces the battery, is WAY too loud, deafening in my opinion. I actually power them on before I'll put them in my ears because of how loud she is.

I would not recommend if you're going to be using it at all to talk on the phone.
For simply listening to music, they work great. I'd give them 4 stars, but the lady who announces battery life is still too loud.

I still love my 535's but this product is not worth the money."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for the convenience of wireless, and the quality of Shure. Been using Shure products for about 5 years now and have loved them all. This one meets my expectations overall, excels in some areas, but fall short in one. Like I mentioned earlier, I love the convenience of these being wireless. The bluetooth feature to connect to two devices and simultaneously switch back and forth depending on which one is playing something / has a phone call is great. I used to have to disconnect and reconnect my old wireless headphones all the time when switching between devices. I especially like how you route the wire behind your ear to kinda hook it around your ear and keep it more secure, just like on the regular wired Shure earphones. Other bluetooth earphones I looked at did not do this, and I was concerned they would fall out all the time. This is one reason I bought these Shures over others like Jaybirds or Bose.

When you turn on the BT1 wireless headphones, you hear ""power on -- battery (how many hours you have left on your battery)"". She always says ""battery: 6 hours"" when it's fully charged, but I've had this going for 8 sometimes upwards of 10 hours without dying on me. Just be sure to always charge them every night if you're a heavy user like me.

Sound quality to me sounds very similar to my pair of regular SE215s with the 3.5mm wire. I also own SE535s, and of course these are nowhere near that quality sound-wise. I'd say they're a small step below regular wired SE215s, which are probably my pick for best bang-for-your-buck earphones on the market the past few years.

One downside is that after about a month and a half, the clip that you put on the (I assume) battery pack and clip to your shirt has broken. It's made out of plastic, so I kinda wish it was a more durable plastic or even some sort of metal for better durability. I contacted Shure support about this, but it's the weekend right now so I haven't heard a response yet. Will update this review later if I get a response.

When the clip was in tact, I really liked how it kept the microphone + play/pause & volume rocker piece kinda floating between my shoulder and jaw for me to easily reach and use. People I've talked to on the phone while wearing these say I sound like I'm speaking on speakerphone, so take that into account if you expect to use these a lot while on the phone.

Overall I'd recommend these."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned a few different audiophile headphones over the years, phonak audeo pfe215, shure e500, e535, vmoda m100, my review is coming from the point of view of someone who appreciates good audio quality. These headphone strike a good balance of performance, affordability and ease of use. The audio is great...for a Bluetooth headphone. There is a little fidelity lost going from the transition of the wired shure 215 to the wireless model. The question is, is the reduction in quality enough to still make this a worthwhile purchase? My opinion of course is a resounding yes. The reason is simple, shure has managed to keep enough of the sound quality that their wired headphones are known for. The soundstage is smaller compared to the wired model, the bass is tight and forceful, but not boomy. The midrange is forward, so things like singers voices come through very clearly without having to overcome boomy lows or overpowering highs. The highs are a little recessed, which for most music styles I listen to isnt a issue. I listen to mostly r&b, soul, jazz, rock and rap. The battery life has been better than advertised, yesterday I was using them at 30% volume and after 7.5 hours, I still had 70% remaining. I’d imagine that if you listen to music at higher volume, your experience may be different. The answer to wether I’d recommend these over other Bluetooth headsets is a definite yes. The added bonus is that you can detach these headphones from the cord and use the other shure 5 series or later headphones wirelessly by connecting them to the proprietary Mmcx cable used in all the recent shure headphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these IEM's yesterday, and I love them! I may not call myself an ""audiophile"". Mainly because I think it's overused and anyone who does lay claim to the title, without either a sound engineering or music degree of some kind, or major studio experience, is being pretentious. That being said, I do have a decent ear. My family is composed of more than it's fair share of musicians, and I happen to be genetically gifted with an ability to hear some things in sound that others apparently do not. I do not have six different pairs of $100+ headphones laying around to compare with. But I have had several pairs of mid-range priced ""premium"" earbuds/IEM's. These have a decent soundstage and excellent separation of high's, mids, and lows. Bass has clarity without losing it's punch. All together I'd say they are a good option at this price point. After all, unless you're listening to FLAC or WAV files (or CD's heheh), on some impressive sound processing hardware, I doubt you'd be able to hear the differences between these and a pair that costs double the money. When using IEM's, most of us are listening to either streaming music or MP3's on mobile devices or laptops. Unless you've got the rare kind of ear that can differentiate betweem a 320 kbps MP3 and a FLAC file in blind ABX comparison, just get these 'phones and enjoy some great sound.
They come with a nice carrying case which is sturdy enough to actually protect them. The cabling is tough and reinforced at the right points, and they seem to be of good overall build quality, but only time will tell on that count. As stated earlier, they come with more than enough ear-tips to find your perfect fit. There is even a tiny cleaning tool enclosed to help remove any kind of residue buildup.
*ONE WARNING* -because of their shape, I think they might not fit well on someone with small ears. I have (I think) average sized ears for an average sized man. The plastic driver housing is fairly large, and rests in the curve of your ear. The actual ear canal junction (all important with IEM's) is very customizable since they come with a variety of tips, but the large driver housing is either going to sit comfortably on your ear, or it's not."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I both love and hate this product. They work great for workouts and very casual listening, but with any type of critical listening you can hear a faint hiss in the background. I am using these with an SE215 so I would imagine any higher models will be even more sensitive."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm waiting cautiously, as I've seen a few people say that the earphones developed problems after a few months. I bought mine exactly three months ago, but so far they are great. I was first pairing with an iPhone 6, then have been pairing with an iPhone X for the last month or so. The pairing has consistently worked, and the connection has been excellent too: it works for real from 35+ feet away (for example, keeps working no problem while I'm walking around from room to room, including when I round a corner and signal must go through one or more walls), and it works for hours on end without any even momentary drops of sound signal. On the latter point, there ARE signal drops sometimes in first couple mins after pairing, as if some sort of buffering or similar needs to get nicely established in the connection. But I have found that after about the first song, the connection is flawless. Battery life is 6+ hours on full charge, including when using the earphones in very cold temperatures skiing. Sound quality is exactly the same as Shure modular earbuds when hard-wired, namely way better than any other Bluetooth earphones I've found - and I've looked far and wide."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Superior sound for most genres of music. Isolates sound very well. Multiple ear tips so you can tailor your fit. Once they are in, they don't come out.
Cons: comfort-the hard plastic nestles well into the outer ear, but will eventually cause fatigue. I don't recommend sleeping in them. The wires bend over the ears, which takes some getting used to fit-wise. Ultimately, I had these earphones about 15months before one of the buds started going in and out. This is with light usage (about 5 hours a week) and careful cord care. Finally, my fellow eyeglass wearers, there isn't much room behind the ear for your glasses and these wires; my eyeglass earpieces rest on top of the wires.

I've owned multiple brands of earphones of varying quality and have yet to find a pair that last much past a year. These earbuds are great, so long as you know going in you will be replacing them in about a years time."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for around 6 months now and am still very happy. I have tried a number of earphones in the past, usually in the $100 range, including the Bose SoundSport. These are by far the best. The sound is very well balanced. Many earphones either have no bass or way too much bass. These are just right. They seal will in the ears to block out external noise and are are almost as good as ear plugs. This allows for clear sound at less volume. The good seal is also nice for physical activity as it blocks most wind noise. Solid construction is with thick cords. So many earphones have thin cord that are easy to break. Thick cord is a must for those who want to use them during physical activity like running or cycling.

What I like:
* Fantastic sound over good frequency range. From electronic to classical to spoken word, all clean.
* Seal well in ears to block outside noise.
* Comfortable for long hours.
* Long cord.
* Heavy duty cord that can take continuous daily use.
* Buds themselves can pivot along the wire allowing them to be positioned in ear correctly.
* When worn as directed (with the wire wrapped around the ear) they stay firmly in your ears and don't need to be adjusted over time."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a fan of the Shure SE215's - this is my second pair. My first set works fine, I ordered this pair because I wanted one wired set and one wireless set. After having owned a wired set for a few years, I can say a lot of good about them. Strong noise isolation, good audio quality, great build quality... easily the best earbud in its price class.

But you can read reviews on the SE215's on their main page. I'd instead like to focus on the killer aspect of this new model - the bluetooth experience.

For people interested in using these headphones for music, or placing personal calls - they work great. They're particularly good in the gym, where the light weight and formable wire portion come together to make a very comfortable experience, and Shure's background with professional musicians gives you the confidence that you can sweat in them without creating issues. The only minor annoyance I found is that if you want to skip songs the control is a bit wonky - it involves holding the volume up or down button for a few seconds - but that's pretty normal and keeps the number of buttons down. So unless you're always skipping songs, if either of these are what you're really buying these headphones for just press ""Buy It Now"" - you won't regret it.

If you're trying to use them at Work on the other hand, you may run afoul of what I think is a critical defect. Shure knows that making/receiving hands-free calls are major reasons people would buy this product, and yet... they don't provide a ""mute"" option. That's right - if you're on a conference call with your wireless headset, you will still likely have to hold your cell phone because you will need to access the mute button. This significantly limits the functionality for me, because if I have to turn on my phone every time I want to mute/unmute I might as well use wired headphones and save myself the recharge hassle."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first purchased these several years ago, I recall thinking at the time that they were fantastic. I enjoyed them for two years, then switched to a cheaper pair (Vsonic VSD3's) for a short while, which sounded comparable. After purchasing a second pair of these shure's when the much cheaper V's broke, I was horrified. The sound I remember fondly was now shrill and irritating, despite my fiddling with the high registers on my equalizer to try to tame it a bit. The mids were pleasantly forward and warm (as I remembered), but the bass somehow managed to be simultaneously both depressingly thin and alarmingly booming. I had a headache after half an hour.

Not sure if the design has changed since the first time I bought them, or maybe I got a bum pair, but man, stay away if that's the sound you get for that price. Check out the VSD3's, they sound excellent and cost half of what the Shures do: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AHU1LNC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

That being said, I'll give the Shure's points for build quality. Mine survived two years of college life fraught with hours of use each day, spills of God only knows what, and just about every sort of physical abuse my roommates and I could inadvertently dish out. The Vsonics are still going after eight months, but I have to frequently glue the housing on one earbud back to the cable base when it comes loose. Still, it's a chore I'm glad to take for such superb sound at such a reasonable price.

One last little note regardless, DO NOT get the Shures if you live anywhere that's consistently cold. I'm in Chicago, and whenever it dips below 20 or so the cable freezes stiff at awkward angles. Annoying as heck."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy! Great sound isolation. The sound is nice and balanced. There is the right amount of bass and the highs are clear without being piercing. The ear pieces are very comfortable. This is my first pair of earbuds that I spent over $20 for and don't regret it. Any cheaper ones I tried were either too this sounding or were very artificial bass sounding. These are really clear and you hear everything without any frequencies drowning out others. These are now my main pair to listen with and I listen to music or podcasts all day long at work so comfort and sounding good are very important to me!
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used many headphones across the spectrum covering Sony, Sennheiser, Skullkandy, SoundMagic, etc. After using for more than 6 months now, I am extremely happy with the SE215 headphones.

Design:
Unconventional yet well-researched. I always had issues having in-ears intact while on bed but that is where Shure's unconventional design does magic. Even during workouts in gym, these stick well in the ears.

Sound:
Audio through the SE215 feels like a breeze. Lows, mids and Highs get equal importance. More like a profession studio headset, the music balances between treble and bass. The sound is definitely far better than Beats or Bose in this price range except that the Bass isn't as punchy as Sony XBs or Beats.

To add to all the above, noise isolation is 100%. Even without music, barely any sound gets through. Accessories and extra tips provided pretty much make these in-ears the best in range. I would recommend these to everyone."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound pretty good. I am spoiled by my Sennheisers. I use them to monitor my electronic/acoustic drums. They do a great job to block out most of the drums volume, I use the mixer and some mics to let in only the sweet stuff. Experiment with the foam plugs, I had to use the small ones to get a good fit. They are a little hard to change out so don't give up. At a closer look the engineering that went into these is amazing, im glad i got see through."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones, because I moved into a new space at work. The new space has surprisingly loud A/C units running full time. Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones were unable to significantly reduce the noise.

These earbuds include 6 pairs of sleeves: three sizes, one set in foam and one in rubber. The foam sleeves are exactly like foam earplugs. They do a great job of expanding to fill your ear canal and block a great deal of noise - even without music playing. These can take a little while to get used to. I've been sleeping with this type of earplug for years and had no difficulty acclimating to these.

The sound is great. They sound significantly better than my slightly more expensive Sony noise cancelling headphones.

As other reviewers have noted, the noise isolation is so complete that you should not use these in an environment where they might cause a safety issue. For me, I had to invest in a mirror for my desk. I didn't like how easily people snuck up on me. Others didn't like the fact that they could be talking to me for quite some time before realizing that I hadn't heard a word. :)"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About three and a half years ago, I got fed up buying pair after pair of $20 earphones after each one broke on me. I decided to spend a little more for quality earphones and don't regret it at all.

Sound quality is great. I can hear everything and the bass is amazing in these buds.

I use my earphones at work everyday for at least 4 hours and my pair has finally stopped working out of one ear. Along the way, I may have put these in the wash too...I also use these when I'm out doing yardwork or playing drums.

I'm not a studio producer or anything, I'm just a dude that likes playing music and listening to music. These give me sound quality that I think is worth the $100, and are durable beyond belief.

10/10. Once the ones I have completely break, I'll be ordering another pair of these."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: Battery life, Controls, Weight, Quality and Bluetooth connection is quick to connect and never drops. Also the microphone and call quality is exceptional for both me and the person on the receiving end. Works with all Shure SE model earphones.

Bad: I find the cables a little longer than they need to be, Holding the volume button for 3 secs to skip tracks is a bit tedious."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For $100, these sound amazing and do a great job of blocking out ambient sound. They are comfortable in my ears for hours at a time and stay firmly in place thanks to the cables that wrap behind your ears. I will reiterate that these really sound fantastic. The only catch is that the cable built quality is poor. This is the third pair of Shure earphones I have purchased and the cables invariably fail within a year of purchase. One earphone or the other will start to cut out when the cable is twisted in a certain way and then eventually that earphone cuts out all together. I had them replaced via Shure's warranty one time and bought a replacement cable the other two times. It is very nice that the cables are replaceable independent of the earbuds, but the replacement cables are about 1/3 the cost of the whole earphone set and you have to go through the hassle of ordering and replacing them. These are great earphones, but I really wish they would fix the cable issue or offer cheaper replacement cables."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The SHURE 215 headphone set is my second set of noise-cancelling headphones from SHURE. My first set was the SHURE 425 EAC model. I was expecting the same headphone, but they are not. The SE 215 design is set to twist into your ear. This is not too much of a problem, but it does irritate me. The sound is good, and you get very good customer service. As long as you have access to your invoice for the headphones, you are pretty much guaranteed a strong warranty. I accidently broke an earpiece last month. I called SHURE, and was told to send it in with a printed invoice. Since I had purchased the SE215 from Amazon.com, it was easy to print a copy. The piece was replaced quite quickly and without any hassle. I have not had the headphones long enough to give a strong write up on the SE215, but I have no problem providing good comments on the SHURE company itself. Also, the 425 EACs were awesome. I just wish I could have purchased another set of those headphones. I had used them for 7 years while riding my Harley Wide Glide and could hear my music very cleanly and without hearing my exhaust note. I do not have the same statement for the SE 215s. When I wear my full-face helmet, I can hear the music cleanly, but then my ears get irritated from the headphones rubbing against the helmet intermittently.

Overall, I currently say that if you wish to wear the headphones while riding your Harley, you will be fine; but you will not have 100% noise reduction. If you wear a 3/4 or full-face helmet, you will hear the music cleanly, but might experience ear irritation. For most other purposes, you should be fine with the headphones. As for customer service, provided you have your invoice, the company is VERY ACCOMODATING.

I have now had the earphones for a few months and have gotten used to wearing them. Trust me, it does take a while to get used to wearing them properly. When worn properly, the headphones DO cut out the exhaust note of my Harley. And, the music sounds clear and interference-free. SO, for those of you who wish to purchase these headphones, know you are gettng quality headphones and quality customer service with your purchase.

I have now had the headphones for a full riding season and I am very happy with them."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing.

I have had several pairs of other headphones in the past from beats and Klipsch. I really enjoyed my Klipsch s4i, s4i-rugged, and a5is however I kept having a problem with the cables going bad after several years. I set out to purchase a new pair of headphones after my s4i-rugged cables went bad way outside of the warranty. I wanted a pair that I could replace the cable once it wears out, and I found these. I am very, very pleased with these. The sound quality is great, very crisp highs and clean mids. The bass is responsive, however not overwhelming. If you like ALOT of bass these headphones are not for you.

The Sound-Isolation is amazing, and the whole world becomes engulfed in the music when I wear these. If you work somewhere that is noisy, these are great to block out the background noise. I can not wait to use these on my next flight!

I want to get into more high-res audio, and I feel like personally these were a great baby step in the right direction!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are better than I expected! I have used several different pair of earbuds in the past playing on stage. These are the best I've ever used! The sound is clear and unbelievably loud. In one band that I play in we have sennheiser wireless in ear monitors and the earbuds that came with them are terrible. It took these earbuds to make me realize what I had not been hearing. I used to have to crank my personal monitor pack all the way to the max to hear anything thru the old earbuds....now I keep it a little below half way on the volume and it is blasting my ears! In another band that I play in we have Shure in ear monitors but I know the stock earbuds that came with them don't work this well. Thank you to Shure for making an affordable earbud that works great! I am also impressed with the feel of the product. They seem to be built very well. The cables are all heavier and I think they will last a long time! I would recommend these to anybody wanting a good quality earbud at a reasonable price..at least for on stage use where hearing what you are playing is crucial.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound about as good as $20 Soundpeat QY7's. My audio source was Spotify set to extreme quality being played on a Droid Turbo 2 for what it's worth. Maybe an extreme audiophile listening to CD or lossless digital audio through an amplifier would disagree with me but using my setup there was almost no difference in audio quality. The QY7's have a little more bass which audiophiles tend to feel is over the top, but I actually like it better for all genres of music. The cord is really cool, the design of the buds are great. They're very comfortable and light. They disappear almost entirely into your ear when worn so you can lay your head sideways on a pillow and still listen comfortably. I just don't think they're worth the price tag or having a cord when compared to competitors."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage. Headphones are fine but this Bluetooth cable is trash. Not only is it $100 of the total price but it has worse range and dropouts than $10 MMCX cables on aliexpress and doesn't even support aptx.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"THE SELLER:
Bought these in early February. First pair was purchased from a company that ended up sending me weight-loss pills instead of these headphones. I returned them and got a refund. Second company was DailyDealzLA. I noticed as soon as I opened them that something was not right with these ""new"" headphones. The normal manufacturer wrapping and cable management was not present at all or appeared disheveled. The foam earbuds were also not as ""clean"" as I would have expected. I left seller feedback about how the product did not appear to be ""new"" as indicated and was informed that these may have been opened by a customer and returned to Amazon, intermingling them with new stock.

I accepted that they might be fine as the foam earbuds did not appear to have earwax or clear signs that they were used contiguously. I noticed they worked fine at the time and accepted them as they were. I opted to up my feedback, as I was quite frustrated having tried to get these twice, and felt that my concerns were abated as the headphones did look alright aside from packaging and slight ""wear"" on the foam.

It'll become apparent, soon enough, why I mention this.

THE LACK OF USE:
I proposed to my, now, wife back in October of last year and have spent the last 6+ months planning a wedding, participating in said wedding, going on a honeymoon, and almost immediately looking for and finding a new house. I have put much of my music playing on hiatus and when I was practicing with my band I was using a pair of old Shure in-ear headphones as I kept forgetting these. While I was not using them, they remained, untouched and secure, in the carrying pouch that comes with them. The cable was coiled in the same diameter as that pouch.

THE BREAK:
Tonight I participated in band practice for the first time in a while and actually remembered to bring these. I plug them in and to my annoyance the left earbud is cutting out and crackling. After confirming the issue was not with the audio extension cable I was using and trying it with alternative audio sources I determined it was an issue with the left earbud, only. Having never tried to remove the cable from the earbuds, something that is possible but never seemed to be easy to accomplish, I followed instructions online and pulled the cable out of the earbud. The only problem is that the part that SHOULD remain in the earbud come with the cable. It broke several of the tiny wires required for operation (see pictures) and now that earbud won't work at all.

Now, I'm not clumsy, foolish, brash, or violent when dealing with electronics. The last Shure headphones my band purchased have lasted 10-years or more, now. However, these couldn't even last 5-10 uses over the last 6-months without breaking.

This leads me back to the seller...

THE THEORY:
I suspect that the first customer who bought these, for whatever reason, attempted to remove the cable from the buds without reading the instructions or watching videos about doing so. They removed the buds incorrectly, noticed that they damaged the product, and returned it to Amazon saying they were not to their liking or were broken. Amazon added them back to their stock, maybe sent them to DailyDealzLA (I have no idea how all that works), and they were sold to me as ""new"". I believe that the issue was not readily evident, if it was experienced at the start, because when used with both headphones, loud-ish rock music, and doing other tasks such as playing music, you couldn't tell with both in. It only became easily noticeable when only having the left earbud in.

It seems like people on Amazon are EXTREMELY quick to review items. I blame Amazon for this as they tend to send e-mails about purchases within a week of the delivery date. Check online for people with similar headphones and you find the same issues I have with my SE215's. It seems the force required to separate the earbuds from the cable is higher than the strength of the substance used to hold the twistable part in place.

THE OUTCOME:
I decided to write this review before contacting Shure about the problem. I will update this review depending on the outcome of that contact. I'm extremely frustrated with my experience with DailyDealzLA, Amazon, and Shure and I sincerely hope that my review of this product, coupled with multiple online experiences that echo my own, will help consumers in their purchase choice."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. Great sound and noise cancelation. When traveling last week, enjoyed my music during all announcements and never heard a word."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND
I bought these ear-buds along with one of the Dr. Dre Beats headsets to compare the sound. They were both exactly the same price but the Shure earbuds busted a righteous cap in Dr. Dre's pretentious creation.
The rich, creamy sound coming out of these Shure puppies is amazing. It allows for the correct balance between the bass, the mids, and the highs without any distortion at various volume levels. I couldn't believe it! The Beats earbuds had an ounce of more bass to them but the mids and high's had that cheap tin-can sound. People's voices came off flat and isolated in relation to the other sounds and it didn't take long for the off-pitch ringing to hurt my ears. Even when I tested the prescribed bass-heavy Hip-Hop/Rap songs on both earbuds, the Shure's stomped-stomped-stomped the Beats out of the competition. Shure's bass, which is a fraction less than the Beats, was still excellent and provided for the sound that felt truly SURROUND.

After I found that Shure's were the one for me, I submitted the Shure earbuds to other tests.

NOISE-CANCELLATION
Technically, these are ""sound isolating"" earphones and I don't know how that's different from ""noise cancellation"" but the one thing is true: these earbuds keep the outside noise out and music in. I drove over to my half-deaf grandmother's house just to test this. She likes to get up close and shout all holy-hell about if you'd like to eat. Cue Shure earbuds and stand in shock as grandmother is transformed into David Bowie singing ""Ziggy Stardust"" and holding a spatula. Crazy. I could only hear the music. But it needed more rigorous testing.
I then went to a friends house who keeps a mini-zoo, including guinea pigs. If you've ever heard a guinea pig squeal, you'll remember it forever. ""Wheee! Whee! Wheeeee!"" I looked those noisy suckers right in the face, holding a carrot and daring them to defy the Shures. A tiny bit of the squeal came though - not even enough to notice unless you were, as I was, looking at them. But that might not be Shure's fault; guinea pigs are hyper-sonic furballs from another planet.

FIT-DESIGN
Yes, the design is initially awkward. Yes, there was a moment when I felt like a lab-monkey, given triangle pegs to put in round holes. Yes, I initiated a contest in my family for who could figure it out the quickest. The current record is 2.75 minutes and one person still can't figure it out; it goes to show there's variation as far as personal adjustment to the design. I was right at 4 minutes the first time I put them in, but after 2 days of use, I can whip these puppies in and out of my ears single-handed and almost as fast as any conventional earbud set. It just takes some getting use to, but if you get frustrated, remember: THE SOUND IS WORTH IT.
They do very well at staying put. After my 4 minutes of wrangling, I immediately started bouncing around and trying to dislodge them. In sum: running and jumping will not dislodge them; however, vigorous head-banging and a solid head-blow by a pillow, will.

FEATURES
No features except extra-ordinary sound. There is no control function on the earbuds. This was a little off-putting for me. I like being able to answer calls, adjust the volume, skip tracks, etc., directly from the earbuds. Such features are very convenient if you listen to your smartphone. If you listen to a single-function device like a MP3 player, then it might not be a big deal for you. Still, its not that bad. I mean, heaven-on-earth, I have to actually push the buttons on my iphone!

YES, GOOD-LOOKS COUNT BUT...
The Beats won the Beauty Contest. The Shure's didn't even get an honorable mention. The Shure's are not as clear as they appear in the picture. While the actual ear-piece is clear, the rest is like dull-silver. And the cable is thick; not thick enough to connect you directly to the energy grid, but thick enough to notice. I showed the thing to a person who knows way more about these things and he was knocked off his chair (in a good way). He said, ""Look at these. It's clear plastic over BRAIDED STEEL. Look! Look how much steal there is!"" and he went on how the steal made some sort of difference in the quality of the sound, limiting frequencies or some such thing (I'm pretty sure I got it all wrong). I looked at them and sure enough, I could see the braided steel. It certainly makes the earbuds durable. And while I'm not sure if walking around with these things makes you more susceptible to lightning-strikes, it certainly will not break when it does. Imagine: crispy critter with intact earbuds and a smile on face because he/she never heard the lightning storm in the first place.

I'm just kidding. I'm sure these are perfectly safe.

SUMMARY: In the end, I didn't hesitate to keep the Shure's, even in the face of lack-of-features and beauty-contest-rejection. For me, the sound outweighs everything and I will dwell is musical BLISS even as I push actual buttons on my Iphone and defend my Cool on the street. Sound is everything."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are the bomb I love them and use them for church.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is excellent: amazing sound isolation (can't hear crying babies on airplanes). However, these headphones do not last. I have purchased these headphones three times (Sept 2012, Nov 2013, Mar 2014). After several months, they break; one of the headphones stops working. I guess I kept hoping each time I bought the headphones, the short lifetime was a fluke or something. I want to love these headphones because the sound quality is so great. But come ON, man. For the cost, they should last more than a year."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excelent!! great sound isolating, Great basses, you can hear every sound range, since basses from middles and trebles, easy to fit."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these and Beats. I ended up returning the Beats. My BF owns a pair of Bose earbuds. Comparing all 3, I thought the Shure earbuds outperformed both Beats & Bose. Awesome, awesome sound & quality."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is excellent, which is what I expected. What I didn't expect is that they would be so comfortable. I can wear these for hours and they don't bother my ears. The variety of ear pieces that are provided allow you to customize the fit to each ear."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit great. However, when I ordered them from Amazon, the left ear monitor was cutting in and out. I made sure to return them"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Only one ear worked. I ended up returning. The quality of sound seems balanced in the one ear but knowing that the cable sucks this bad I wasn't interested in getting a new one only for it to break again.

If you are interested in getting this be safe with the cable and it should last for some time. I don't know if I could carry them to and from work every day."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is excellent, and it's perfect on the train - I cannot hear a thing. With many cheap headphones that means turning the music up very high. With these I don't have to. I'm very happy with these."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,She said it was one of her favorite gifts. All day long Christmas day she kept the in her ears.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm rating it 1 not because of the sound but because of the product quality. The earpiece is uncomfortable to wear for long duration, it's takes long to just just wear it properly. Because of the design of the ear piece left and right ear pieces get entangled and again, takes longer just to wear it. Worst part is the wire attached to the ear pieces, it's too thick and hard for an earphone. Plastic cover of the wires starts to break after a few months. I tried taping it but that doesn't work, now I have around 5 breaks in it.
Honestly I don't know how can it be so difficult to design a proper earphone that you would make all the mistakes imaginable. Now I'm going to hunt for another one, not from Shure for sure."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through three sets on in ear headphones in the past year. I was looking for a more rugged set that would last me longer. These seem to fit the bill. The cord, which is the part that has failed every time, is thicker and heavier. The sound quality is excellent."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased the Shure SE215-K as a Christmas gift. I must say on the behalf of the receipient that it far exceeded it's reviews. Was very pleased with purchase.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for earphones, I have enjoyed them greatly over the last year. On crowded and loud locations like the bus, these are amazing since they block almost all sound out. This also means that you cannot wear these while you are driving or playing sports since you will have no idea what's going on in your surroundings. The way that you wear them was a bit peculiar at first, but eventually I got used to wearing them and found that they are comfortable. These honestly sound better than my full sized headset, which is impressive, but it has errors with my computer only playing out the right side. I honestly think this is an error in my program and not with the headphones since they work correctly on every other device."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality gets 10/10. The design to wrap around your ear is very bad and takes quite a while to get used to.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the SE215 is a slight improvement to the already fantastic previous generation of the same earphones. I had the last pair for four years until my cat chewed it up.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had probably a hundred sets of headphones in my life and these are hands down the most comfortable and best sounding ones I've heard. Better bass than my Bose triport over-ear, and more comfortable than anything i've ever worn."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The positives are they are amazing headphones for the price and they SURVIVED A TRIP IN MY LAUNDRY MACHINE.

the negative is that inevitably you will send them to Shure to get fixed because the left earphone goes dead due to s***ty cables or connectivity which is a recurring flaw due to the design of removable and replaceable earphones. Since returning the IEMS and getting them back most people have no issues but its an issue you will have to deal with.

Yeah it was still worth it. They are my go to IEM."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"after using it for over a month i have 1 huge issue with my earphone
my left earpiece makes annoying metal.clicking sound whenever i move the wire.. i am going to contact shure to see if i can have it fixed or replaced

-edit

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Shure before and TRIED to endure these on long flights...my ears were sore for hours afterward. The flanges were ok, and they come with different ear buds, but the plastic on the outside of the ear canal were just so uncomfortable. Good sound blocking when you finally get them situated. Wish I had my money back."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still adjusting to the buds being in my ear, as I've never been an ear bud kinda guy, so there's a very minimal amount of discomfort, which I attribute only to a growing pain that I will grow out of. The sound quality is remarkable, but I have to remind myself of volume levels because of that reason. I bought them as a possible permanent replacement to can headphones while dj'ing, but I doubt I'll ever chose one over another for good. Though I am looking forward to seeing how much more movement I will be given by using these over the Allen and Heath cans I still own."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: These headphones sound great. They are crisp and extremely detailed while still maintaining power.

Cons: I can not get comfortable in this headphones. I have tried all of the tips, and none of them are comfortable for me. Furthermore, the wire that folds over the ear only stays in place if I am still. Obviously comfort is a personally preference, and I am sure a lot of people love the comfort of these, but they are not for everyone.

I took two stars off for lack of comfort for me, and another star off because the right side has already failed. I have barely used these headphones because of the lack of comfort, and they have been taken care of well, and yet the right side still failed. They are still under warranty, so it likely won't be an issue getting a replacement, but overall durability is a concern."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Shure products for a few years now and they never fail me. Great product!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing. I will admit that it is difficult at first getting used to putting the buds in your ears.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually do NOT like the heavy 'memory' wire cord. It's a little too stiff. I have the SE425's too, which are twice the price and have 3 drivers and sound 3x better. They also have the crappier cord which makes them harder to insert. Since they aren't easy in and easy out, I don't wear these as much as I'd like because of that.

The Sure equivalent w/o the memory wire gets much more use."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These particular earbuds are very good for commuting or jogging or whatever vigorous activity you may be engaged in because of the way they fit in and over your ears. They also provide very good sound as far as bass,highs,lows and midrange. Would definitely recommend them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is incredible. Good bass, all other levels are very clear. Took practice to get comfortable in my ear and fit is snug."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect IEM for the novice.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound... The feature that I enjoy having is the replaceable cable.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing clarity despite being a little bulky and having a thick cord. As sound is the most important aspect in buying headphones to me, as well as noise cancellation for drumming, these are really top notch."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them on BART and they are perfect for my commute. I can still hear some outside noises, which is okay, but the sound quality is better than any headphones I have ever had."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound quality.....and they stay in my ears better than most everything else I've tried. Stout wires and good build quality.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying, these headphones have pretty much the BEST sound quality you will get from ear buds. They sound just as good, if not better than every pair of over-ear studio headphones I've ever owned. Unlike most ear buds, they are really comfortable. The foam pieces that go in your ear are very soft and didn't cause me any irritation like ear buds normally do. They also have GREAT noise cancellation. These things must be made out of the same stuff they make ear plugs for shooting guns with.

NOW...
I used these headphones for 3 months and the right ear piece has loose wiring already. I can't get any sound out of it. I used them to listen to music off my iPhone while I walked to class, so it's not like I even needed them to be that durable. These would totally be worth the price if they had lasted me a decent amount of time, but 3 months is pretty bad."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I like shure products but the cord is shorting and this happen in the first week with 3 gentle. I have not contacted the seller yet.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!!! arrived on time and in good condition. They block out almost all sound and gave great sound quality. They work the best for rock. Using them as i write this.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,For less then a hundred dollars you cannot go wrong with these.The fit takes a little practice but once u get them on They won't fall off.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is pretty good but the price is a little too high. There's a lot of high ends in the earphones and it lacks the low ends. But over all I'm satisfied.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed, hardly any bass, would of returned item but lost the product information that came in the box."

Feels durable and extremely comfortable in your ear. Sound is fantastic, clear, and full of bass!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought around 20 sets for our church. They sound great, included six different sets of tips, any user can figure out how to use them. The only downside, if you consider it a downside, is that parts are a little more expensive than I'd wish them to be. On the other hand, I probably should just change my expectation.

I've actually slept all night with these in, and they were surprisingly comfortable. If that's your thing, these will work. This makes me think that they will work very well under a helmet, but I couldn't say for sure, I haven't tried that."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. The mic is useless if there is any white noise. Don’t plan to use this as anything other than a normal pair of headphones.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update about 6 months in, regular use on air travel about twice a week for 3-5 hour sessions... LOVE THEM. I'm returning the 5th Star.
....
Recommended by /r/headphones Reddit for travel size and noise isolating (for air travel).

Best headphones I have ever used. Would prefer if they had volume control or a mic but in sound isolation and clarity, these are the great.

Only reason I am holding back a star is because I have seen quality issues in the reviews and the first pair I got was defective (cutting in and out on one ear). My second has been working great, just make sure you test them fully before you let the return period expire."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Connection distance is short. One has to be creative enough to figure out a comfortable way to wear this. The reason I didn't give one start is because the build quality is relatively okay.

But the sound quality is bad, just bad. Shure can't justify the performance out of this price. I don't recommend this."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These have generally decent sound quality without distortion, but there is a quite audible hiss. They're able to drive the SE846 earphones with more than enough power. Like most Bluetooth audio devices, they go into a power saving mode and take some audio to ""wake up"", so they're useless for things like notification sounds. They're okay for when you need to listen to music while traveling and what not."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile, but I can still tell this makes a huge difference to music quality. For one Shure has mastered the fit so due a perfect fit and great noise isolation the music already sounds great. Second the drivers are actually better and even though the earbud is not bass heavy I could actually hear the lows much better than the others I've used in a similar budget. Can't comment on durability yet, but the cables look great. Of course, the area of questionable durability will be the nozzle on the bud (made of plastic).

If you're not under a tight budget get the bundle that comes with the Fiio A1 amp and the sd card for ~$115. That was my only regret."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So for number of years I have tried to find some of the best headphones whether it's been in ear or over the ear, and I had my doubts about these in-ear headphones at first. I did not realize that they need a ""Burn-in"" time frame which may vary from what I have researched. The biggest thing with these headphones will be the getting used to the in-ear placement of the headphone itself. I will stress this, you will need time getting used to these being in your ear's for a long period of time, but once you make it past that point you will be go to go. Now as far as performance, I would have to say they are stellar and are a cut above the rest.

The high's are crisp and tight.
The mid's are are not all over the place like cheaper headphones.
The lows are the closest thing to being in the studio.
The cord is very durable.

Now for the bad.

The cord is not long enough since you do have to where the cord behind you since they are sound monitors not regular headphones.
The different headphone sizes are great but are a pain when trying to remove them or switch them out.
The ""Burn-in"" time may be a little too long for some users.

All in all, if you are looking to upgrade your in-ear headphones for better quality sound and performance these are the ones for you."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned several headphones and earbuds over the last decade and have owned the Shure SE425, Shure SE315 and Shure SE215. I have also owned Sennheiser and Klipsch to name a few.
Sadly, my SE425 ( a gift from my family) was stepped on and crushed accidently (bad day there) and I can't afford to replace that. I play the bass guitar and upright and use my SE315 when I sometimes asked to sit in at church (far cry from college band days in 80's)
I would say I am probably like most everyone - I want a great set of earbuds that give me the best listening experience AND I don't want spend $100 and wonder if I paid too much or could have spent less.
The SE215s are, in my opinion, the best cost to quality ratio of any earbud I have owned. FULL range of sound, mids are good and low end is great! The SE215 is versatile and will accommodate any music style or genre you enjoy.
YOU MUST BURN THEM IN by just playing 20 hours or more of music (I just turn them up to 60% on my IPhone/Ipod and stick earbuds under a pillow). They sound great out of the box, but IF you do buy a really good set of earbuds they get better with use.
IMPROVEMENTS: Shure has improved the one issue I did have with the earlier model SE115 which was the wire connection to the buds themselves. That thick cone shaped connector at the earbud itself is an actual connector allowing you to replace the wire OR ADD the MICROPHONE/CONTROL cable. I bought my daughter these earbuds and the jack got bent and just replaced the wire.

Bottom line is the Shure SE215 is designed, professional audio equipment at a bargain price and If you can go a few extra bucks and want a set of earbuds that sound like $300 earbuds then the SE215 is a worthy investment."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice quality, I'm not used to the crispness. I can hear things in the same songs i have been listening to for a while. Super noise isolating, its like having ear protection in. I cant hear anything but the music and its super clean and crisp. Came with foam replacement tips as well as rubber ones, the carrying case and cleaner tool. Lots of instructions but all i bothered to read was how to wear them. Stays in my ears very well and i have had issues with that before. Nice investment for anyone who uses earphones. Not too bassy though."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I struggled for a long time between purchasing noise isolating buds or noise cancelling buds. Ultimately I decided in these because they were so much cheaper than the Bose QC buds. I was glad that I did. I wore these on multiple flights while travelling from the Midwest to London, and they successfully blocked out plenty of noise and sounds of crying babies and talking, especially with music playing at a low volume. And speaking of music, the sound on these buds is fantastic. Clear, true bass tones and well balanced mids and highs. They create a good seal in your ear without effort once you get used to taking them out and putting them in.

The build quality of these is also great. Every piece of these feels sturdy and built to last."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome equipment. Shure comes thru again. These are the only earphones that I've tried (and I've tried plenty) that provide the comfort, fit and sound quality that an earphone should have."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Left earbud stopped working after 3 months of once a week use for about an hour. We'll see how the warranty works from here. At $100, this is disappointing."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"One ear never worked properly, and the seller would not RMA them. They told me i had to go through Shure which takes forever. My guitarist is on his 3rd pair, finally got one that doesn't sound horrible. Sad but true.

After 3 painful returns with Shure, i finally have a pair that work so upping from 1 star to 3 stars. They sound great when they work. Just wish i wasnt worried everytime i put them on that they werent going to."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best fitting headphones I've ever bought.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,They do no fit snug in my ears and constantly have to adjust them. Sound is good but bass could be better.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphone I have ever owned.

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had to buy 3 iterations of the S215 for the last 10 years or so, as i lose them every 3 years. they are awesome. sound is balanced, and so clear. the noise blocking is out of this world. great product from a great company that provides excellent customer service. Also nice that if the cord gets stiff from sweat you can simply replace the cord and keep your drivers. I like the ones without the iphone controller / mic because the cord wont bounce around."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better then expected. Bass kinda lacks. But overall one of the best I've owned.

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these about a month ago, and so far, I love it. The sound quality is really good, the bass hits the right spot, it's very well balanced.
Only problem is that the left earphone SOMETIMES cuts off, so I hope this doesn't evolve to a complete cut off anytime soon."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, just have to get used to how they fit."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Until we allow babies to be shipped via FedEx to their final destination as opposed to riding on an airplane, I'm going to be using these to block out their piercing screams."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have many different top end headphones. These are amazing! They have great high/low and the bass is perfect. Strongly recommended. I will be buying more for gifts.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound but not the best fit for motorcycle riding.

very durable - detachable cable is great, have not needed to replace yet though
great sound quality and very good sound isolation!
I'm sticking with Shure"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for studying in noisy environments. Comfortable, convenient, and feel very sturdy due to the fact that the wires are covered in kevlar."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great ear buds with a very professional sound. They are detachable so you can install different cable with a Mic if you want.

These naturally conform around your ear and fit pretty comfortably. The construction is also very nice. The cables feel very sturdy and the 'buds' themselves are very rigid.

The only con that I can think of is that they do not have high quality bass. The treble and mids definitely stand out though."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for three days now and the longest continued listening time so far is almost 5 hours. I did a full recharge out of the box and managed to squeeze 3 hours out of them. Being that they were sitting on a shelve somewhere; I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I gave them another full charge, the voice prompt said I had more than six hours of battery life remaining, which should be 8 hours as that’s what’s listed. I listened to them for my 30 minute workout, turned them off and an hour later powered them on and the voice prompt now said I only had 4 hours of battery life remaining. I used them until it was time for another full recharge. Again when I powered them on the same voice prompt said I had more than 6 hours of battery life remaining. I put on my favorite playlist and let them play at a moderate volume; I was able to get 4hours 50 mins, before it was time to recharge. I like the fit, the sound is nice, but the battery life is terrible, I was not expecting this from Shure. I would definitely not recommend these to friends or family."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To my disappointment, I discovered the right earpiece of these phones did not transmit sound straight from the box. In fact, when I opened the packaging, I found the wire and the earpiece were disconnected already. If the detachable connection is supposed to be snug, why was it already loose and detached? The only way I could hear anything through the right side was squeezing the connection between the wire and earpiece. My brother—an audio engineer—also confirmed this problem.

Very disappointing, to say the least. Didn't even get to experience the amazing sound that I've been reading about. The fit (with a small foam attachment) was nice, though.

I will try again to purchase my own Shure SE215—but I'm taking my earphone business to Sweetwater.com."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Painful to wear longer than 30min at a time, otherwise sound wonderful."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for less than a year. Initially I was quite happy with them. The audio quality is good, a definite step up from the earbuds included with your phone. However after a few months of daily usage I encountered glitches and dropouts in one year. Detaching the cable from the earphone and re-attaching it temporarily solved the problem. However the next time it occurred the connector broke as I was trying to detach it. So now I have a broken $100 earphone."

I should feel comfortable taking my headphones off if I see someone on the street to say hi and not spend literally 5 mins standing there trying to figure out my headphones to put them back in.

I've had this since 3/26/16 and by then the smell was gone and i've gotten used to putting it on. However, the right ear bud cuts off the music sometimes. I've owned numerous earbuds/earphones/headphones and this is a sign that they will one day cut off completely in the time to come. Honestly, I would expect the earbuds to last longer due to ""Kevlar"" that these earbuds are made with. The sound quality is still amazing, and if you want to buy these, I would recommend them if you use them sparingly."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound when the correct tips are used. It's a must to have them sealed completely off in your ear otherwise they will sound weak. Great product for the price, the tangle free cord is a great feature!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While I have no complaints about the audio quality, the build and durability of the included cable turned out to be very poor. While detaching the earbuds for storage, one of the earbuds failed to detach from the wire, pulling out the entire connector which broke along two weak solder points. For such an expensive piece of equipment, I certainly expected better build quality. I recommend purchasing KZ ZS3 detachable earbuds instead.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought three or four sets of headphones in this series (they do wear out, or I break or lose them) and have always been satisfied. The phones on the new model - SE215 - are very comfortable and easy to insert and remove. The new feature of having the plug-in cords is helpful and smart; if the cord or earphone should break, you can replace just that part. That said, the whole set is fairly rugged. Sound isolation is superb. The sound has good balance with neither highs nor lows predominating (I do have a high-frequency hearing losss so I might be off here). For the price point, it's hard to imagine a better buy."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Although these only have 1 driver. They are terrificly balanced and ready to use on the get go. I also recommend the yellow foam sleeves in addition when you buy.

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are alone in their class for the price. They compete with earphones that cost $300-$400. BUY THEM! Could not be more satisfied
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm expecting high quality earphones for the premium price. I owned one set of e2c and it lasted for over a year but this one failed on the third month. Though it is still under warranty, I will probably opt for another brand in the future to avoid the hassle. My brother-in-law also bought SE215 and had a problem with the connector of the detachable cable. Looks like there are a lot of problems with SE215.

So Shure replaced my failing earphone and I'm very happy to get the replacement but my happiness is short-lived. The right earbud failed this time. I'm not buying Shure ever again."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not bothering with a review of how these sound other than to say that I like the sound of these slightly more than my Klipsch S4 II earbuds. The foam tips cut external sound out very well...surprisingly well for headphones. Whereas the S4 headphones have a tendency to push out of my ears, requiring that I put them back in place periodically while using them, the Shures stay in place perfectly. Always.

These should include a microphone and call buttons for the price. Yet, they have quickly become my favorites without having to spend $400 on a set."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these for almost a year now. The bass quality isn't what I thought it would be and now the adjustable part that goes behind my left ear broke and scratched the crap out of my ear.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,These SE215 K Live are okay. For the sound quality I think they're a little over priced. If you stick any earbud deep enough in your ear they'll sound decent.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these on stage with as a bass guitar player. They work great. They block out almost all sound around you. I have to take them out to hear anyone talking. The bass thumps in my ear quite loudly, so I have to have the volume turned down from my previous earphones. I have friends who have been using this model for a long time with no problems."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Shure SE215-CL earphones are an outstanding entry-level IEM (In Ear Monitor) for musicians. These single driver earphones deliver a reasonable frequency response at a more than adequate level. If you are looking for a very flat 20-20kHz response the SE535 triple driver is a better choice. I own both models and have gone through the process of having custom Avery Sound ear pieces made for these; which delivers the full on-stage experience with great monitoring and amazing isolation.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these due to the super low price Amazon had. I own a few pairs of other earbuds/headphones and my previous favorites were my Klipsch S4. I assumed there is a plateau for all earbuds and any increase in quality would be negligible. I was wrong in my assumptions. The Klipsch S4 fit comfortably in my ear, but the bass was low. Even putting my iPhone on ""Bass Boost"", it isn't what you would want it to be. To obtain more bass, I assumed (again) that I would have to purchase a larger earbud that would be uncomfortable or transition to over the ear headphones. These were not good options since I use my earbuds to workout. I purchased the Shure SE215-CL and I was blown away. It is amazing how clear these are! More bass and the highs were more crisp. The style was awkward at first, but now I like it more than the in the ear earbuds. Even my Klipsch would slip when I would sweat a lot. No environmental noise is allowed in my ear, just crisp, clean music. I actually gave my Klipsch earbuds away! These are that good."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for less than a day. But I can say that these are the best set of earbuds I have ever owned. I was looking for a change from the earbuds that came with my phone. But I didn't want to shell out for the audiophile quality ones. So I was deciding between the sennheiser in ears and these and I picked these. And I think overall I think I picked the right ones. The noise isolation of these are amazing. I do a fair amount of bike riding around town to get errands done. And with these in I don't hear the noise of the traffic. That is how good the noise isolation is with these. And the sound quality of these are amazing. I am sure once I really start breaking them in they will sound even better.

The only really two nit picky things with these that I have found. The fact that the cord is a little bit longer than the old pair that was using. And the fact that these go over the ear to fit them in. Both not huge issues for me at all. As far as them going over the ear. It is just gonna take time for me to get use to putting them in not a big deal. And as for the extra length of the cord goes. If I am using these with my phone I just put the extra length of cord in my pocket with my phone.

If you are looking for new earbuds or a upgrade form the cheap $10 earbuds. These would be the perfect ones to go with and I can't recommend these enough."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a musician who enjoys recording, playing live, and listening to my favorite artists in a way that does their music justice. For in-ear headphones I use these! I can't wear these headphones for a very long time (all day), but the sound quality is very crisp and clear. I also like traveling with these. It blocks out a lot of noise and sit flush against my ears so that it doesn't hurt to lay my head down. I've seen some reviews where people have trouble hearing out of their headphones, and I would suggest doing what the company suggests...use the cleaning tool they provide and make sure the passage way is clear of dirt. For over the ear headphones I suggest Bose SoundTru over the ear headphones. They are incredibly comfortable and I can wear them all day if I wanted to."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned a few pairs of these over the years. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. Recently I have been listening to more and more Bluetooth headphones due to the convenience of not being ""tied"" to the device that I was listening to, which is usually my phone.
A few weeks ago I came across a Bluetooth transmitter that I can plug my shure se215 into and make them bluetooth. The brand is Anker, about $25. Very small and alters the sound very little, if any.
Great headphones that are now bluetooth. I'm set."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start of by saying this is a great pair of IEMs for $100. These were my first pair of IEMs and I bought them because I didn't want to lug around some big headphones whenever I might needed to listen to some music or use normal ear buds(the non in-ear kind) because of the bad sound isolation. These ones solve both those problems extremely well. The build quality is solid, the wires are top notch and you get 3 sizes of Shure's in-house made comply foam tips and 3 sizes of normal rubber tips. You also get a nice nylon pouch with a hook thing to clip onto stuff, like holes in bags etc. Also a cleaning tool for earwax build-up. Putting them on the first time will be challenging but you will get the hang of it after a while.

So this product is great if you're looking for something like that. However the reason its not 5 stars is probably because of a personal circumstance. I already own a pair of high-end headphones. Coming from those, the sound quality is almost the same but not as comfortable, probably because these are my first IEMs and I'm not used to shoving things into my ear. However there is a slight bit of micro-phonics(cable rubbing noise) that comes with every IEM in the world, you can't escape it, and the fact that the noise isolation is so good, if you're not listening to music, congratulations you get to experience the awkward feeling of being deaf for the first time in your life. That may or may not be a praise. I think I just prefer the comfort of headphones, but if you're used to IEMs, then this $100 baby is as good as $300 headphones, well almost, but pretty dam close. The headphones have better clarity and a more spacious sound stage. Great value for your money I might say.

Also there was a problem where the audio jack was too thick and may cause fit problems if you had a narrow opening on your phone due to a case, this problem has been eliavated by a improved design. The thick wrapping around the pin now has been shortened, allowing you to get into smaller spaces on phone cases.

So for the sound quality. The bass is loud and thumping, also depends on the eartip you use. Rubber tips gives more pronounced bass where as comply gives clearer mids. The highs and mids are decent, not that I can tell properly because I'm not a professional Audio connaisseur.
Pros
+ Great audio quality
+ Great Build quality
+ 3 Tip sizes of rubber AND Comply foam
+ Pouch
+ Improved Audio jack

Cons
+ Not top of the line audio
+ Will not be worth it if you have expensive headphones

Tl;Dr Very good IEMs for $100, for this price range to be competitive to more expensive headphones is very impressive. Probably one of the best choices you can get in this price range. If you have spoilt yourself with expensive audio, then this isn't for you."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is fantastic and they are very comfortable for me.

Noise isolation is okay, but for me nowhere near as good as some other reviewers have experienced. If someone is talking while I have these earbuds in I can still hear them, though attenuation is moderately better than other earbuds. I've tried all 3 sizes of foam tips and, for me, small and medium are about the same in terms of noise isolation and the large are bad. I suppose my ears are just not the right size for these to be as effective as they could be.

When I compare them to my Sennheiser HD280 headphones (not earbuds), they block about the same amount of sound and quality is about on par. When I put the Sennheisers on over the these SE215s I get real noise isolation. It's amazing, totally immersive, and really what I was hoping to get from the earbuds alone.

These are very good earbuds but I would not have bought them if I'd have known that they wouldn't really be sound isolating for me."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these earphones/monitors because the sound is AMAZING. Great bass, clear sound, and excellent isolation. However, I think they may have been made for the slightly larger (male?) ear. The foam tips, themselves, are comfortable when you find a good combination, but because these earphones require being wedged into the concha of the ear to stay in, it feels like the tips of the earbuds are being pushed too far into the ear canal, which is slightly painful. Tried them with different sizes of tips, but they were uncomfortable every time. If your ears are slightly larger, though, you should have no problem. I'm going back to my trusty Shure SE-115s, which seem to be a bit friendlier for the smaller ear."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Other then a handful of songs that are incredibly intricate with loads of diffrent instruments at the full range of frequencies, these head phones are the best I have herd. They are super comfterable and can be worn while laying on your side which is kind of impressive.
I feel like the bass doesn't go as low as it should and the highs do at times over power other ranges. By this I mean that the the deepest of lows do not register at all and anything at the low end of its rated range is weak. However the mid lows are beautiful (bass drums, most techno lows and r&b lows are usualy the mid lows while the low end of bass guitars and some techno that uses realy low frequencis are the super lows). The mids are great and super clear while the highs are crisp. It's only when you are trying something that uses lots of stuff on the low end and lots in the high end that things start to crackle at high volume. Such times could be during a realy hard rock song (and I mean they have to be going nuts in this song) with something like double bass drum peddles and the guitarist going nuts, vocalist doing his thing with constant simble crashing for anything to sound anything other then imaculant"

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way these sound. They are awesome. So why only 3 stars? They are Pain In The Backside to put on. They also require making sure you have the right earplug (trial and error) to get them to sound the way they can. If they didn't sound so damn good I'd have returned them, but they have amazing sound, so they are worth the trouble."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,This isn't really a review of the SE215's as a whole but more so the pair I received because I've had several of these and this is the first that has given me any issues. Of course these in ears are great for the money. I'm an all around musician and started using these as a drummer playing various venues and shows. Always used in conjunction with the Shure PSM200 system and it's always worked great. This latest pair though is a little weird. First thing I noticed was the highs weren't there for some reason. Played many different songs on a few different devices and it was the same over and over...highs were sort of missing. And secondly the right ear ear phone seems to pop every time I insert it...when I push it in and it goes back to resting position it pops again. Really weird. All in all the shore se215's are great and I'm not sure I want to go through the trouble of returning these and going through that process. We'll see.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because they were reviewed on CNet as very durable. Well the cable is durable, I will say that. However, the ear plug itself has snapped off after only two months of use. Not happy. Even if they hadn't broken, would not have been very satisfied with this product. They go on over your ear, but it is not a stable fit in your ear and too much movement (like jogging) will pop them out. The only good thing I will say about these is that the sound quality was decent."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly worth every penny, sound canceling is amazing, the in ear security is flawless and the part of that is the most susceptible to damage(the cord) is replaceable."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for working out (run/weight train/crossfit). It took a while to get used to them fitting in my ears, I've always worn the conventional ear buds(under the ear) and this was my first experience with ""over the ear"" type buds and I'll never do that again. Please don't get me wrong, these sound fantastic, however it's a pain in the butt to get them in your ears and once you finally do.. You can notice you're wearing them, and subconsciously it began to annoy me. When I workout I want to focus on my workouts, not my earbuds. It was more of a neussance to have them on more than anything.

PROS: Sound great, sound isolation is phenomenal.

CONS: Would take too long to put them in, difficult to fit in ears, took time getting used to the ""memory wire"" that wraps around ear, headphones cord too long (would catch everything), once in ear they felt heavy, I also felt like they had too many working parts and would eventually fail within the workout environment."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these headphones is excellent--however, the quality of construction leaves A LOT to be desired. After only two months of cautious, mild use and no incidents of physical damage, one of the headphones literally cracked in half while I placing it in my ear. This is unacceptable, and it is the first time I've dealt with a device within this price range breaking so quickly. Hopefully I received a pair of defective headphones and my experience is out of the norm; whatever the case may be, I am unsatisfied by the results of my purchase. Be warned."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really want to give these 5 stars, but I just don't think they are worth the money. I use these on a daily basis but am not blown away. Even with the smallest foam ear inserts, these are two large for my ears. Maybe these are intended for only men or something? Also I am just not that impressed with the sound quality. It's good sound, but I've heard better in less expensive earphones."

He does not like to have the headphones that clip over the ear, but I thought I would try these. Unpon receiving the headphones my husband and I both tried to use them in our ears. Neither of us were able to get them to stay in our ear.

The sound quality was not nearly was I was expecting. Although I could see how a musician would love these, a 13 year old would feel they did not have enough bass. I would recommend these, but not to a child. I will take some time to get used to putting them in your ear."

I have to move the cord in order to get sound to come out and that is when I'm sitting down. I imagine it's pointless if I were on the move. The right earbud is fine.

In addition, the shape of the earbud hurts my ear. I've used other Shure earbuds that were round instead of this longer design and they were great, but this design feels like it rubs on the inside of my ears and becomes painful after longer use.

Would not recommend these."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to make this purchase, despite the pricepoint even for those who already own the Drivers. After I made the purchase, they arrived on time, with a fair amount of packaging for one small cable. The end of the cable which attaches to the driver started to lose the gold rings (contact points) and this seemed to indicate a very cheap and low quality build. if i'm very careful, I won't lose this little piece (which I think may be essential) but something brand new like this 6 inches long shouldn't be falling apart after 3 days of use. Additionally, I had difficulty charging the device unless plugged into a wall outlet with the correct sort of adapter. I travel quite often and found it annoying to not be able to charge the device as often as i'd like. decent purchase but I think the generic alternative would just as good of a product, if not a better value. we'll see how long this thing lasts. . . ."

They are so high quality that I feel they are almost worth twice the price, and I would almost be willing to pay it.

I purchased these headphones for working out. When they work... they're great. The problem is that the bluetooth cable is unreliable. In the past four months, I've had two units fail me. It's extremely frustrating when you show up at the gym and suddenly the bluetooth unit completely unresponsive. You shouldn't have to bring backup headphones with you because your wireless headphones are unreliable - but that's what I've come to do. Although Shure has good customer service/warranties on their products, there should be more reliability for a cable that costs $99."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great (really good sound and isolation), but they weren't made to last, that's for sure. Mine came with a minor problem, that I noticed the first time I put it on (right earphone was failing). As I live in Brazil, I had to live with the problem since a RMA would take a huge time. Now exactly 4 months since I bought it, the right side is completely dead. No sound at all... Too bad for a product that costs US$ 99,00. Next time I will stay with Bose (the ones I had before SE215-K, unfortunately I lost them on a plane).

Now all I can do is wait a hell of a time for the RMA !!!

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is amazing and sounds very clean. However, it seems to have not that great of a connection once it's out of your hands, seeing as though it skips every once and a while which can be kinda annoying/distracting.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a few hours now and I'm absolutely loving these. I've never invested 100 dollars for earbuds before. I have however just bought 100 dollar gaming headset for the xbox and these are definitely superior in sound ""quality"", that said the headset is wireless, so. These earbuds are the best I've ever owned for sure. I do wish there was more POWER.. I don't know how else to describe it, the sound is incredible but it'd be nicer to have more of a BOOM if that makes sense and It's not bass I'm referencing.. (don't let that deter you though, it's probably just me needing to get use to the different tones) I'll say this, for the price, absolutely satisfied and I'll go with this brand if I ever decide to get a more expensive earbud. Also, a few side notes: someone mentioned the sound of the chord is annoying..(when you have earbuds in and tap the chord the noise sometimes makes a loud thud in your ear) I know what he's talking about because I had this issue with my last earbuds and these I don't really notice a significance in noise from moving the wires. Also, I have these things BLASTING and it's absolutely silent from the outside, you can't hear a thing going out or coming in."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted these for a long time and finally made the leap. They are among the highest regarded In Ear Monitors by the audiophiles on reddit where the SE215's were first suggested to me. They fit flush with my ears; so much so that I can comfortably lie with my ear against a pillow and not feel like there is much pressure. Depending on the shape of your ears (mine are average size), your experience may vary. I have had difficulty with previous ear buds staying snug under my motorcycle helmet, and these with the flush fit and the over ear wire will stay put nicely.

My test music was Mozart, Shpongle, The Who's Tommy, NOFX, Nellie McKay and Royksopp. Was concerned they would be too bass heavy from what reddit folks said, but they seem to be just right. Not the best for classical but the electronic and rock sounds pretty fantastic. The highs were bright enough and Nellie McKai sounded like she was whispering right into my ears.

These are new and I have yet to find any flaws but will update if anything comes up."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds alone aren't design for sport since they were design originally for musicians and/or more valued music listeners. The earbuds are very nice and allow different earbuds for different ear sizes. The earbud may not look nice when wearing in the eyes of many people, but the quality is beautiful for this price. It has managed to overtake the most distorted guitar screeches, to the most deep bass drops and tempos from my playist and sound like if I was there helping produce it. My first pair got damaged since it used for working out, (NOTE NOT INTENDED FOR SPORTS AT ALL. Earbuds not designed for that.) but Shure has a amazing customer service alone I would give 5/5. SInce they gave me a new replacement no problem. I highly recommend these as they are durable and sleek in design with the most beautiful sound quality 100$ could get you for these. You won't regret it. (FINAL NOTE: THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST STUFF THEM IN YOUR POCKET AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OKAY. THEY INCLUDE A CARRYING CASE FOR A REASON WHICH FITS NICELY IN YOUR POCKETS. THIS WILL BE A HUGE WAY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR EARPHONES. LET ALONE THE EARWAX REMOVER FOR THE EARBUDS AND TUBE FOR THE MONITORS.)

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose IE2i and Bose AE2
I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear STIE
Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off. The earphones wiggle a bit when running, though not enough to break the sound seal. Relatively expensive.

SE215
Great balanced sound; strong bass; low impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first set of IEMs I've owned. I've always been using earbuds from Sony and other random brands. I was apprehensive at dropping $99 on a pair of earphones, since my previous ones would always die within a few months of having them. However, I found that my fears were unfounded after receiving these. The sound quality is phenomenal, I haven't owned anything like this before. I listen to electronic music mostly (trance), and the highs and lows are pretty balanced on these. The bass response is pretty good, it's not too heavy, but I think it's definitely enough for my own enjoyment. I've lost track of how many hours I've listened with these, but they are really comfortable and don't hurt after wearing them for hours and hours.

I enjoy using the Comply foam tips that come with mine, the sound isolation is excellent. It isolates so well that I cannot wear both pieces in my ears while I'm at work, since I cannot hear what my coworkers say to me even if I have the volume pretty low. I can use both the medium and small Comply tips; if I use the mediums, I have to compress the foam and then insert them into my ears, but with the smalls I can just slip them in and I still get the same seal.

The only complaint I have with these is that the stock cable that comes with the earphones are a little awkward to use for the first time. I had trouble trying to get the memory wire fitted around my ears properly. Once they were on properly, they were pretty comfortable. I don't really recommend wearing these in combination with glasses though, they might feel weird. I like that the cables are thick and Kevlar-reinforced; I have no worries about the durability of the cable, and it can easily replaced if it tears. I also bought the CBL-M+-K-EFS so I could use it with my iPod and iPhone. I like the fitting of this cable more, since there's no memory wire, so it's more comfortable to use while wearing glasses.

I think that if these ever break down, I might try out the se215-LTD. I might even try out some of Shure's higher offerings."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been in search of the perfect pair of earbuds for what feels like an eternity, I've gone through dozens & dozens of sets. I'm a cyclist; mountain biker & motorcycle rider (disclaimer: using earbuds while riding is prohibited by law), finding a set of earbuds that can meet all my needs and not cost me my first born was not an easy task. I've never found a pair of buds that stay in my ears and offer pristine sound at any volume level until now, and the best part is the noise canceling feature; while cruising at 60mph on the open highway the wind sounds has been diminished so greatly that I can actually clearly hear my music even at a very low volume level. These earbuds are worth every penny I spent on them!"

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first pair of these earbuds died within three weeks of purchase. However, I am cursed when it comes to my first pair of earbuds dying. My replacement pair has lasted over a year and a half now, and sound amazing. Ive used them when walking around campus, and while typing papers and I find them really comfortable. The fit is a little odd, but once you get used to it you will like it. The fit is secure and even if you were glasses (like me) you won't find the over ear cord annoying or uncomfortable. Also worth mentioning is that the foam tips are amazing at blocking out sound. I have worn these earbuds on 8 hour plane rids and they block out most if not all of the sound. The low profile design makes these great for wearing under a helmet/hat or while laying in bed listing to music. As with most things I am sure you could find a better sounding pair of earbuds, but I can't imagine finding a better sounding pair in the same price range. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for a higher end pair of earbuds. You won't be disappointed."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good and they fit well, so on the major stuff, these are very good headphones. Good balance of bass and clarity, good isolation. My only gripe is that the cable is too long and prone to twisting. I wear these to work out and I have to run the cable under my shirt to prevent the cable from catching on equipment because there is so much of it. That by itself is not a big problem, but it somehow it manages to pull on my ears and on the iPod on my arm after every set. Somehow there is nearly 4 feet of slack cable inside my shirt on my back, but it pulls tight everywhere else. No cable has managed this. I've looked into a shorter replacement cable, but alas, Shure does not make one."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds quality is just OK. It does not seem to deliver bass very well, but on most songs it seem to be just OK, not great and not terrible. This didn't bother me too much since sound quality was not my primary motivation for buying these, I was looking for the noise isolation properties.

The noise isolation features are a mix. The earbuds themselves actually work fairly well in isolating noise, as advertised, but the cables are awful. This seems to be due to the cables being more rigid and heavier than usual earphone cables. Unless I stand (not sit) absolutely still, all I hear are the cables rubbing against my clothes or my table or whatever object is nearby. The only remedy seem to be to detach the cables completely, turning these into an expensive pair of earplugs.

If your intent is to replace the environmental noise with cable noise, these earphones will do the trick. If your intent is to drown out environmental noise with music, these earphones perform poorly relative to other earphones."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my old Shure earphones (which I loved to bits) and needed a replacement.
This new design is way too difficult to get into the ear. I returned them the same day.
Even if this item was free, I wouldn't use them.

I bought the Sennheiser CX 300 II which is nearly 1/3rd the price. Has wonderful sound and is very comfortable."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Bose IE headphones before these, and there is no comparison, these have such clearer mids and highs, and you can really feel the bass in these earbuds. They also sound better than my qc2s, which is pretty surprising considering the price difference, although I cannot speak to comparing them to the newer qc15s. It takes a little while to figure out just how to get the earbuds fitting comfortably, and in the right position. If they don't sound incredible right from the start, you're probably not wearing them right. If the silicone or foam tip is not in the right position to give you a nice noise isolating seal and get the sound directly into your ear, they sound like completely mediocre headphones. With a little adjustment, you should be able to feel a good seal, preventing most outside noise, and then they will sound amazing. I take a train into a city everyday, and they cancel out almost all outside noise, making for a great morning commute. They handle everything beautifully and most of my music sounds like I'm listening to it for the first time. Jazz (Miles Davis, Ella and Louis) sounds richer and more dynamic than I've ever heard. One of the most interesting things about the Shures is that in areas of songs where extreme highs used to be grating on my ears using other headphones, on these they sound more balanced, much less harsh, and more like the notes were probably intended. Rock, classical, pop and bluegrass all sound amazing, but the Shure 215s are most impressive when you throw bass-heavy music at them. Daft Punk sounds like you're at a live concert, and the bass rocks like you would not believe. All in all, these are incredible earbuds that deserve all the praise they're getting. Highly recommended."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the worst experience with these headphones. the way they want you to put them in is very awkward. I had to look in a mirror every time to get them in upside down properly Once you get them in they are not at all comfortable and after a half hour your ears start hurting. The cord feels very stiff and they impede your movement, so couldn't imagine working out with them or anything. the sound is adequate but hardly blew me away. I sent them back as I don't see how you could possibly justify these being $100. Maybe you get used to some of those things, but I don't think they would ever be worth the price tag."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones and hope to use them for a long time. I use them as IEM's when I play the drums and they muffle the sound of my drums very nicely. The sound is well balanced and easy on my ears. The one complaint that I have is that the part of the cable that is adjustable is not as sturdy as it was made out to be. The way you are able to mold them to your ear shape is through a wire that runs along with the cable. The wire deteriorates and snapped after only about 6 months of use. I would recommend being prepared to buy an extra cable or a third-party braided cable which would offer more support. Otherwise, these are a great pair of IEM's at an amazing price."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am amazed at the detailed sound production of these earphones. I have previously owned Shure Se110 and Shure Se115, and these are completely on a new level. I hear more detail, more treble and a better sound stage. The bass is also very tight. I found that using the foam sleeves it was difficult to get a perfect seal, and so the bass was lacking. But after changing to the silicone sleeve solved the problem and it blocked more outside noise and I was able to feel more bass. Detachable cables are a plus, and Shure's 2 year warranty is one of the best in the business. I have previously returned my Se110 for distortion problems and Shure send me new pair without any questions asked. I totally stand behind this company and love their earphones. I hear instruments that i never knew were present before. These earphones are a great bang for your buck. For $100 you are getting a great product, 2 year warranty, detachable cables and one of the best build quality that I have seen."

Don't get me wrong, these earphones are built with exceptional physical quality and the cord seems pretty robust. Sound is another issue entirely! I'm aware there is only one driver but the sound quality is absolutely terrible. Huge amount of muddy bass and frizzled clarity as I tested these phones from everything to Bjork / George Winston / Clara Ponty / Bon Iver / Feist / Fleet Foxes / Memphis May Fire / White Chapel / Between the Buried and Me / Beloved / Thelonious Monk / BB King. They sound much better as the phones are turned up louder but I shouldn't have to make that compromise to have a minimal par sound from a pair of $90 headphones.

I really wanted to love these but unfortunately Shure didn't do these phones justice on the sound level. Looks like I'll be switching to Etymotic for now."

But more importantly, as others have noted, the cord is stiffened and bendable near the ear supposedly so you can mould the cord over the top of your ear, but it's difficult to manipulate, requiring 2 hands (and even in the mirror I had a hard time putting these in).
The older models just easily slipped into the ear, and over the ear. There was no need to ""improve"" on them.
I've returned mine."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the sound quality expected.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds are great. They have some serious bass. That said, the sound is incredibly well balanced. The only flaw I can point out is that the highs are slightly weak. Still, 5-star earbuds."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound fantastic but one of the sides where the cable and earphone connect stated to cut in and out was really frustrating and i had no way to take them apart it was like it was glued in there

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great for what you're paying, actually these should cost more with the audio quality they deliver. Unfortunately I had to return these for two reasons:
1) I could not get over how uncomfortable these were. I have pretty sensitive ears and the wrap around cord was a constant nusance and just felt uncomfortable.
2) this next reason is my fault, but I wasn't looking for earphones which block out all noise, which is something these earphones do well. I couldn't hear any outside noise, this making me feel uncomfortable when walking in public."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are terrible earphones. The right ear bud failed after about ten hours of use, so I ordered a second pair, assuming my defective first pair was a fluke. It wasn't. The right ear bud of my second pair failed after about the same amount of brief use. Do not purchase this product."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality - use them under my helmet - should have bought them years ago!!!!
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. Good sound quality and the ear pieces provide good ambient sound insulation.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The behind ear design is ridiculous. The mic version cable is very thin and flimsy and was clearly not designed to go behind the ear. Therefore the cable does not stay behind the ear and starts flopping around. This is as good as trash. I miss my SE115.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll just keep it short.
As others mentioned, the sound quality just blows other products, with similar price tag, off the water.
However, the design flaw of the product constantly cuts off the sound.
For instance, if you turn your head certain way, the sound gets cut off.

Even putting the design flaw into consideration, the amazing sound quality just tops that negative aspect of the earphone.
Overall satisfactory product."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst earphones I've ever bought. One side started to stop working after only a few hours of having them and the sound isn't any better than the cheap $10 earphones I had before I bought these. The chord is really bulky and unnecessarily long, so it's always getting tangled and caught on things. The earbuds are uncomfortable and I couldn't get a good seal with any of the earpieces that were provided, so there's barely any sound isolation. I'll make sure to never bother to buy a Shure product again if they are all this bad of quality."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality, battery life, and comfort factors all work well for me and I've had no Bluetooth connection issues. I can't discern any difference between Bluetooth wireless and cabled audio using my SE215s, but then again I might have a tin ear. I have had good success the the microphone despite the somewhat awkward placement when the cable is worn behind the head. The included clip allows it to be secured to the back of a shirt to keep the cable from swaying around while you are moving. Overall I am happy with the purchase. One star lost because of the lack of aptX support but this isn't enough to make me unhappy with the product on a day to day basis."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Used one day and returned for a refund (Amazon is great about this). The buds were a pain to get in my ear and stay put.

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had got these headphones about a month ago and these sound unlike anything I've ever heard! The review these have gotten are true to their word. I've owend many headphones throughout the years and I can honestly say theses are my best buys so far. I like the detachable cables so if the cable has a short just replace the cable and not the whole thing. One thing I would recommend is buy a set of triple flang ear tips as they make a perfect pair!

what more could you look for? and at a price of 100 bucks.. (I'd snapped them when they were 90 bucks tho ;))
All I could say is this is money well-spent.

anyone looking for wonderful earphones all around should seriosly consider these. I'd reccommend it to anyone with no hesisation. in fact, one of my friends has bougth one after my reccommendation and he's loving it!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep this review short and to the point. I received these headphones yesterday and had trouble with them from the start. The foam tip is EXTREMELY hard to pull off, which is ridiculous. I felt like a bodybuilder after I removed them. I even caught myself flexing in the mirror. The sound quality is good, but not good enough to justify it's price. The highs are a bit harsh and the bass and drive are lacking. The headphones become rather uncomfortable after 30 minutes or so. The only positive is the sound isolation, which does a good job at blocking out sound. I'll give these another chance and will continue to use them for the next few days. If I have a change of heart, an updated review will surely follow."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for about 2 months. While the sound is one of the best I've ever gotten from these types of headphones, one of the earbuds died on me. This probably happened due to having them coiled in my pocket, stretching possibly etc. If you do consider buying this; make sure you treat them with care, just because they're expensive doesn't mean they're invincible, and I would strongly recommend buying from the website so you can get insurance (if that's a thing for these)."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would classify my self as an audiophile. I have a Mcintosh amp and B&W 803D Speakers as my main listening environment. I would say these are a little light in the bass department for my liking the highs were crisp bu not over powering. I would say these are very good for the money. I have there predisesors and have used them for years. the E2c. I can not report any issues with this headset. I would like more clear highs and some more deep bass but given the drive configuration of these they are very good. I would buy them again
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"REVIEW UPDATE:
Shortly after posting this review, I ran into some serious, and constant issues with the Bluetooth connectivity. It's advertised that this unit would receive a 30 foot connection radius. however, they would lose connection even when sitting less than a foot away from the connected device. This occurred with two phones (iOS and Android), my watch, and my laptop. I have contacted Amazon, and a replacement unit is being shipped. I'll update this with the outcome when I have it. But until this issue is resolved, I have to lower my rating. While the sound quality is great, the main selling point of these earphones is their Bluetooth connectivity, and if they can't do that critical task, I can't see why you'd not just purchase the wired version for $50 cheaper,

If you’ve ever used the wired 215’s, you’ll know exactly how these fit and perform. The only addition is he new Bluetooth cord, which provides much more versatility. Connecting the earphones to my phone and watch proved effortless. I’ve used the wired 215’s, and there is no difference in the sound quality; crisp and full-bodied.

An all-around winner for its price range. And the great thing is is can use the same Bluetooth cable for my 535’s if I so desire."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mucho goodo.

Because I did not buy them directly from Shure I don't get to return it to them. $100 headphones that lasted me barely 2 months, and if you consider that I only use them on Sundays and Wednesdays (and not every week) I didn't even use them 30 days very disappointed"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums in a regularly gigging band and have been wanting to move away from an active on stage monitor to an in ear system. I purchased these earphones and together with an inexpensive headphone amp I have achieved that goal.

I now am able to hear the other musicians, as well as myself without the having my ears blasted by my drums along with a loud on stage monitor. I have used this setup a few times now and I really do like it. The sound produced by the Shure SE215's is very adequate for my monitoring needs. I am sure that had I spent many hundreds of dollars more on custom fitted ear phones I would have a even better result but this is fine for me and it was definitely an affordable solution.

The cable on these is very heavy duty and I can see it being very durable.The wire near the ear pieces, bends nicely around the back of your ear and with the various types and sizes of rubber and foam inserts I think most people will be able to achieve a comfortable fit.

I have recommended this product to friends and will do so in the future."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for four years, and I can honestly say that these stand the test of time. I probably use these about an hour and a half every single day. The cords last me about two years. Cat chewed one cord, and the other cord had a snap in the flexible metal rod near the earpiece (for shaping the cord over your ear). I went with a cheaper off-brand cord for a few months, but ended up just buying the cord from Shure each time because it is much better quality. $30ish every two years is not that bad as a ""maintenance"" cost, in my opinion. If you are more careful with the cord than me, it will probably last much longer."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate a good set of headphones. I think these are priced for those who know they don't want the cheap stock headphones that come with most phones and tablets but aren't discerning enough to notice the extra stuff in the headphones that are in the 200+ range. Overall I think where my other headphones struggled was when I listened to jazz because I would get those crackling distortions. In these I don't get that at all and I can really hear a lot more detail. The insertion into the ear can be confusing at first but works well after a couple tries. As far as comfort I think I would have chosen the Bose sound sports but in reviews they said the Shures had better noise isolation which was a bigger concern of mine."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several sets of on-ear noise cancelling headphones from Sennheiser over the last several years, but decided to try these in-ear Shure SE215s at the recommendation from an online review site. Wow. Wow!

The sound isolation from these headphones is simply incredible. Noises from planes, office environments, mowing grass, etc. are almost completely blocked out. The incredible thing about this isolation is that I now hear musical passages and sounds that I would never have heard in these noisy environments from a portable set of headphones. As an added benefit, there is no active circuitry, so batteries are a thing of the past!

The sound quality of these are amazing as well. I've paid more than twice as much for over-the-ear cans and honestly have a hard time finding much difference in the sound from these portables. There is a slight over-emphasis in the mid bass that I sometimes have to tame with the free Denon EQ/Audio app that I typically use, but the rest of the spectrum is top notch, especially for the price. If I wanted to spend more, I've no doubt that the sound quality would only get better the SE315s or 415s.

I am pleased with the comfort of these as well. It took a little time to adjust to the feel of a set of in-ear headphones since I was coming from years of on-ear portables. I tried all of the supplied pads and settled on the medium foam set. I can wear these continuosly for 5-6 hours if needed, so transcontinental flights are a breeze. Sleeping in these is much easier than before as well. They are much less obtrusive than on-ear phones and the sound volume can be very low because of the high isolation.

Construction seems to be good as well. I have seen other reviews regarding one or the other cable giving problems, but I haven't had these problems and I have used them outside, exposing them to sweat and numerous cable snags. Having the ability to replace the entire cable assembly for roughly $30 is a nice plus too.

In short I'm very happy with these headphones. The fact that these sound so good, yet are so small and portable is amazing to me. If you have a discerning ear and might find the need for occasional EQ on some recordings to be a nusiance, you might want to spend more and go for the SE315s. If you are like me and don't want to spend more than $100 on a set of portable headphones that might get lost, stolen, or otherwise damaged, then look no further.

Pros:
-Noise isolation is amazing
-Sound quality is impressive for price
-Comfort is very good, 5+ hours is easy, and sleep is also possible.

Cons:
-Mid-bass might be too heavy for some, can be tamed with a little EQ."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, these are Shure, but what does that mean to you, and why should you buy these? These are of the quality you would expect from Shure. This is a newer design by the manufacture that allows you to change out the cord with different models. The highs are crisp, the mids are fantastic, and the bass is powerful. These come with several in ear pads that allow a custom fit for you. You've tried the cheap in ear monitors, so now may be the best time to upgrade to these in ear monitors. You won't be disappointed with this model."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Bose in ear headphones for so long I didn't think there was anything that could be better other than studio headphones. I was wrong way wrong, a friend of mine bought these things and I just so happened to borrow them one day (couldn't find my Bose) and these blew me away. In fact the next day when I returned these to my friend, I told him I bought some on Amazon last night.

I simply love them, along with great sound they basically cut you off from the outside world with its sound isolation technology. I thought my Bose were good at that and after using these I realized that Bose didn't do anything but let outside sounds be heard. I also like how the actual speakers separate from the cable so after extensive use they can be replaced.

The only downside I have had with these is the over ear part of using them, seems to be hard for them to keep their shape once in your ear. Shure could have done better in my opinion by just keeping it simple with a cable hanging from them.

Overall, these are well worth the $100 you will spend to get them, they are far superior to Bose in-ear headphones. If the money isn't a problem to you then these will serve you well."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. But first I have to say, I got sent a defective set. Needless to say I was pretty disappointed but I sent them back to Shure for a warranty claim. Within 2 weeks I received a brand new set, no questions asked. The new set was amazing. I've used mostly cheap headphones. The best I've had was a set of Skull Candy Titans earbuds. These blew those Titans out of the water. Great sound, high highs and low lows. The sound isolation is great and I really like the over the ear style. I've fallen asleep with these in my ears and didn't wake up with sore ears. Just a good product all around....with the exception of getting defective ones of course."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was disappointed for a while that this product wasn't available on Amazon Global but recently a friend came back from the US so I asked him to bring it back for me.

I must say it was worth the wait. These earphones are really solidly built - the cables are thick, heavy and long enough for the rowing machine (putting the phone on the floor). The sound is rich and natural sounding. I use them over a mix of audiobooks, pop, rock, hip hop - it handles everything well. Of course, the sound would assumably be even better with the higher end Shures but you'd have to pay several multiples of this (you can see from all my reviews that I have a strong value bias). For this price, I'd say this beats the Ultimate Ears 600s and are now the ones I like to reach for to enjoy my music.

I think one thing that really helps are the foam tips - it forms a very good seal, making the music even more immersive. I wonder why not more manufacturers ship their earphones with foam tips?"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for use in my church praise team in-ear monitors after a recommendation from our worship associate minister. As a bass player, I need good bass response without losing the highs from the other instruments and vocals and these fit the bill! With other earbuds, I had to crank the bass so much to overpower the drums that my ears would be ringing by the end of the day. The noise isolation of these earbuds allow me to turn down the volume but hear more, and save my hearing!

My only gripe is that the foam tips are a bit difficult to remove, but that also ensures that they don't come off in your ears!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I work as a scopist (a person who edits legal transcripts for court reporters) and use buds daily. I was looking for a comfortable set to replace the ones I had worn out. Sound is VERY important since I need to hear exactly what's going on in depositions and trials, and these fit that bill perfectly in that regard. The sound IS great. However, they drove me nuts! I hated the over-the-ear wire. I was very awkward. I wear glasses and it was frustrating to get that wire to stay put. The buds kept falling out (and I tried several sizes) and the wire annoyed me. I couldn't just pop 'em in and go. I had to adjust them each time. No thanks. I don't have time for that. I got the Bose IE2 instead and LOVE them. The sound is amazing and I don't even feel them in my ears. Easy in, easy out. Good luck to you all in your search."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best workout earphones out there. The over-the-ear design limits that pounding noise you hear when you tap on your wire when having earphones in. If you are not buying them for working out, then I seriously do not recommend buying earphones at all. Get a pair of decent headphones with a bigger soundscape."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelation on these iems is shockingly effective. The cable isn't particularly comfortable but is extremely durable and keeps theme from falling out. The overall sound stage is fairly narrow but not quite cramped and not at all muddy. The basses are rich and strong but certainly not overpowering, the mids are clear and the trebles are articulate. They performed just a little better than I wouldo expect from a relatively quite cheap pair of IEMs. Would recommend would buy again."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphone doesn't live up its hype/amazing reviews on Amazon, PC Mag, and many other expert consumer electronic reviewers. As a person who has been quite active in the earphone market for the past 5-6 years, the earphone doesn't project the sound of a $99.00 worth of a machine. I would recommend getting something else with a similar price like Beats - urBeats (sigh, here goes the hate) or Klipsch X5/X10 rather than this earphone. But I really appreciate their customer service for letting me return this thing, thanks.

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am surprised that this earphone didn't eork for me. I aas counting so much on its brand name. The sound is very thin and broken. My husband used it for his game but he wasn't also happy for another reason that it don't hold up well. I wished I had the time to return it.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to have quality sounding ear buds. I had eventually hoped to find a pair of ear buds I can skate with. Generally I struggle w/ ear buds falling out as I look left / right in traffic and sweat being an issue.

I got these Shure SE215-CL just to try them out. I wasn't so much concerned about the sound as Shure is generally decent quality (bit over priced in my opinion compared to what you get just like Bose).

After wearing them at my office desk in Orlando, FL, I realized the sound quality was fairly decent w/ a nice bass quality and noise canceling. Sadly I could not wear them for more than 15 minutes. After 15 minutes sitting in front of my MacBook, I realized I was in great discomfort. No matter how I position the anchors over my ears, they sank down and pulled my tops of the ears down along with the discomfort of having the buds in my ear which I assume you grow used to...

Point is these were extremely uncomfortable in my ears as a personal opinion. Your mileage may vary but after 30 minutes, it was clear this was a return for me."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for durability and decent sound quality. I wasn't expecting the best sound from them but wanted something on par with Klipsch Image S4's. After trying multiple different ear piece sizes and listining to them for 5 days I finally gave up. They don't sound as good as the $37 Sony MDR-EX210's I've been using for the past month... let alone the image S4's. They lack any mid range sound performance and have no bass except for extreme low notes (rare in most music even rap). The main reason I bought these was the durability. Aparently Shure failed here too as the left side intermittently cuts out a few times a day and has since day one.

I was hoping to have a decent sounding pair of earbuds that would survive the abuse of being used 8 hours a day for over 6 months.My past 4 pairs of $70-100 headphones have all failed near the cord connection to earbud, the cable, or from liquid. At least those earbuds sounded good for almost a year before they broke. These were a failure from the begining."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own these earbuds and i need to say that these are the best earbuds i have ever heard.
About the isolation-
The earbuds are so isolating when you first use them you cannot hear anything or anyone when you put your ipod at 25% power. If you think that you could go on a jog with these be careful cause you will not hear a thing. After a while I need to take out the earbuds because it can get uncomfortable hearing nothing from the outside world.
Also when you play the music it will feel like the music is coming strait from your brain.
Sound Quality-
The treble is nicely represented, not to harsh and not to rolled off. The mids are brilliant but when i first used them i thought that the vocals sounded a little quiet on these but i find that after a month or two these earbuds break in and everything sounds beautiful. Now my favorite part, the bass. I love the bass on these. I have the ATH-M50 and those sound great but sometimes id like a little more boom to my bass, and these earbuds do a fantastic job of delivering bass (Its not annoyingly bassy, but I find it to be just right).
Another note-
When I was looking for earbuds i had to choose between these the soul by luda, and the beats. These earbuds are made for ADULTS and not some fancy pantsy rapper. Dont get the cool looking pieces of plastic because they look cool, save your money and get something that will sound better- PLEASE!

Anyways if your looking for a sub 150$ headphone than look no further because i cannot recommend this headphone enough."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these and used for about 4 months on and off. I was pleased with their performance. Then the right ear piece seemed to lose one of it's drivers and became very quiet so I sent it in for repair. Shure sent it back saying it was a counterfeit and they couldn't service or warranty it. I haven't been able to get any service from Amazon either so now I'm out my money and a pair of in ears.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! Fast shippers.

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although advertised as fitting those who like fidelity of music, they did not fit to my ears to make the sensation of being isolated from the outside."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones for the price! I don't think there's a better set of budget in-ears for limited use out there. I bought three sets of these for my worship ministry at my church, and they are holding up great. These are the sets most of the team prefers to use. Love the swivel feature."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasted 100 bucks. I purchased to use as in ear monitors as in the description and blew them out in first rehearsal.Of course this was after the return period had passed.I used in studio for about a month
and they sounded great but at performance level they just dont cut it. I figured i would purchase these to get a feel for what i might need in a performance setting, what i learned is 100 bucks doesnt get you a useable IEM.Nice little ear buds not so nice IEM.
spend the money get something you can really use. Shure makes great products but these are NOT useable IEMs for a three pc rock band."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent headphones for me one of the best on the market with a spectacular presentation and a size suitable for the man who uses it every day and a high quality material like the sound
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot comment on the audio quality of these earbuds because they were defective on arrival. They were needed for a concert on 9/12/15 and now we have to go out and get another pair someplace local where we can evaluate them directly. The earpiece was too large so one of the smaller ones was needed. The earpiece was either forced on or an adhesive was used. I pulled and twisted on the earbud with all my strength and it finally came off a millimeter at a time. Was far too difficult. To make matters worse, the other side earpiece completely broke off from the device before the earpiece would come off, thus ruining the entire se215."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's a quick review of these Shure SE215-K earphones The sound quality is wonderful. Good bass and even mid's and high's. It took a little while to get adjusted to the fit of the earpiece but after a few runs you don't even notice it. But I must say, because of how the earpiece goes over the ear sweat tends to run into your eardrum. Not good. Also the connection at the earpiece needs to be eliminated. Does not hold up and may cause interruption in the sound. Very frustrating. But if your a casual listener these are great and I would recommend. Hopefully Shure will come out with a sports version."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Short and sweet. Sound quality is good, not 100 bucks good, but good. Incredibly annoying design, constantly slips out when Im running. Very annoying to put back in. The whole loop over the ear thing is ridiculous. I would not buy this design again, but if they had a more straight forward in the ear design Id consider it."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelent
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Brand new. Un-boxed. Plugged in. Noticed the left side cutting out after only 10 minutes. Pitiful, PITIFUL quality assurance by Shure! These should have NEVER passed inspection (if they even inspect in the first place). Other than that, they sound ""okay""."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,i really love it
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay - nothing is meant to last forever...but these earphones are top notch. Recently my old Shure SE headphones broke. The cable near the headphone cracked due to being dried out. I had them for 7 years and listened to them twice a week, while on a plane and used them in the gym. They cancel out the noise w/out using sound. I tried changing to Klipsch and Etymotic, but didn't like the cords. When I moved, they were extremely loud. I reverted back to Shure and I am glad I did. Shure's repair policy and customer service is garbage, they wanted $90 to repair my old ones, and for a few bucks more I could just buy new...but they last a long time and a have great sound. Food for thought..."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,so amazing~~~
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these for a couple of months now and can't get them to fit right most of the time - only on occasion am I able to get them to sit tight. Then they're amazing except I dread that anyone will try to talk to me because you can't hear anything and then need to take them out which means struggling to put them back in again.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones. Warm, well rounded sound. You'll hear everything more clear than you ever have. Ambient sound isolation is great.

They can be a little tricky to get in your ear at first, especially if you have small ear canals like me."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute piece of junk. Broke within two weeks, no hard usage, no exposure to moisture. It's under warranty, but it's not worth the time or money for S&H to replace. Good sound quality, but not very comfortable. I bought these because they were supposed to be durable and reliable, but it was a waste of time and money."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy cheap headphones, because they brake all the time. I am brutal with them. I use them in work & the gym, etc. I decided to buy some good one's as the the cd in my local gym was seriously wrecking my head. My friend recommended this set and he was right. The minute I put them in my ears I knew I had been idiot. I heard parts in tracks I hadn't heard before. Sound isolating is the way to go. If I get a year out of them I'll be a very happy camper. Definitely worth the dollars,"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them Great!!

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound quality but the actual ear buds are awkward and it's hard to get them positioned in your ear properly. Bending the wire over your ear is also annoying... I had an older pair of Shure earbuds that was much better. Just put them in and go without having to fiddle with them...
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Right ear failed (quit working) during 12 mi run..grrrrr! :-( The bass and overall sound were excellent though. Besides failing, my only issue was putting them on/around/in my ear quicker. I'm returning these and going back to Bose!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. They have great bass, clarity in the high end, and good definition in the mid range. They come with six different sets of ear pieces and I found a good fit, so almost everyone will be able to find a good fit. I've been working in a sound booth part time for the past five years and have tried many different sets of headphones, including some that cost much more than these and honestly these are the best value for any in-ears under $225."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these earphones, great noise cancelling and quality sound at a reasonable price. However, it seems that it was too good to be true, as just after 1.5 months of moderate use, the left earphone died. And it wasn't a cable issue as I switched the cable around and still had no sound coming from the left monitor. Quite a shame, as I'm sure it wasn't something on my part as I'm really careful around my electronics. Can't return as time's up for RMA."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good!!!
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never been an in-ear headphones kind of guy, but these are great. We use this on stage for worship, and I literally only hear what I want to hear."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from Klipsch S4i, these sound much louder, much bassier and almost everything is better. However using the Klispch I used to love the overall neutrality of those, these are a teeeny bit bass heavy but that's fine by me and m sure with a lot of other people too.
Totally worth the price and infact probably the best you can get within this price range."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of Shure SE115s which I liked very much. Unfortunately, I left them behind on an airplane. Since the 115s are no longer available, I ""upgraded"" to the 215s. Compared to the 115s, which had strong bass but a very warm overall sound, the 215s sound very tinny to me, more like some $40 Sony earbuds I had a few years back."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"sorry to said but i have a cheaper headphones and are doing the same work as if it was like this expensive headphones, don't have a lot of volume, i was looking for a headphone so i can hear music in a loud environment,"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great. I use for playing music in a band at church and my old ones always distorted when all the different instruments were turned up. I used these for the first time and had no distortion. Nice to be able to have adequate bass and drums without the crackle and buzz. Took a little to get used to how they connect in the ear, but after a few tries I had it down."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The listing mentioned nothing about the earbuds designed to be worn LOOPED around your ears. I bought these for my wife for Christmas. Wife hated them. Then had to hassle with the return
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great sound quality, but the ear buds are cumbersome to use. I am sorry that I bought these as I don't use them now. They take too much time to put on and then they do not stay in ."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're used to the old Shure headphones (as I was) you will be disappointed by the size and shape of these. The large plastic diaphragm is very uncomfortable, at least for my ears. I'd recommend trying one of the competitors since now there are many more than there used to be.

Sound quality is as good as ever though."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely well designed IEMs with an excellent design with the exception of one design flaw.
I'm very hard and headphones and though I liked the Klipsch S4s, I was going through a new pair every 3 months.
The cable connection to the earpieces kept going bad. So the detachable cables on these IEMs sold me.
The cables are extremely durable and thick, and detach through a unique swiveling connection to the earpieces. I got quickly used to over-the-ear style which also takes some the strain off of the cable.

Sound quality: Very very good for $100. These take ~50 hours of breaking in, but after that provide
very solid bass and clear albeit slightly rolled-off highs. Compared to the Klipsch S4s, they are more balanced across the entire range. Overall, not quite as much bass punch as the S4s but more neutral mids and highs.

The one design flaw: The plastic posts that hold the earbuds on are longer than average, which helps hold the inserts on with more force. Unfortunately, the plastic posts will also easily break if you happen to step on the earpieces. After 3 months, both are broken and the IEMs are unusable."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Now the right earphone is so low I can't hear anything. I unfortunately would have to return these.

Changing my review, the left earphone is no more working properly, the volume on that one goes out intermittently and is always low. I mostly use this earphone when I fly, which is twice a week."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am, well was, a big fan of Shure. I have used an E2C for a number of years and was really impressed with their quality and performance... these were work horses. As a highly trusted companion they were with me at least a million miles and so many airports... and they just WORE out. So... I purchased the SE215-K... - really impressive sound! I pulled them out of the box and took them on their maiden voyage and for the first few hours they worked like a champ then things went down hill. The sound started fading and coming back and then it went mono with intermittent stereo with a weird phasing sound... I twisted the plug and stereo would come back and once I let the plug go it would go back to mono. I changed Ipods (spares in case of battery failure) but they were the same - even checked my phone. I fidgeted with the cable and realized the failure is in the plug... uh oh...

I guess I could get on a soap box about quality but why...Shure had a great product - typical. I am sure Shure chose to save a hand full of pennies and introduced a sub par supplier... and their quality has plummeted. If I wanted a $20 set of in ear monitors I would have bought them - instead I paid a little more (lot) for QUALITY but that seems didn't come in the box."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,They weren't that amazing for the price they give. They say they feel good after long periods of wearing but it's not. After 10 minuets of flat no bass listening they hurt my ears and I just put on my cheap iPad headphones which I prefer over these.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading a log of reviews both positive and negative, i took the plunge and bought a pair of these. The quality of the earphones is great if you could get them to stay on your ear. Having them stay on my ears was the most challenging part of it. They would keep falling out even if you start chewing gum or something like that. Because of the discomfort i had in having them on my ears i rated it low, for quality i would say its a 4 star product"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these buds when they worked. First pair was intermittent out of one ear the first day. I liked them enough to try it again. Got the next pair and they worked for about a week. Just long enough to really be disappointed again. I would pay $200 for a pair of these that would last a year. Buy, getting tired of shipping them back. Moving on to another brand. Based on other reviews it sounds like this is common. I'm surprised there are so many good reviews. Maybe everyone writes them in the first week of owning these things."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You have to be a pure audiophile to not love them.
3 best things
1. Sound quality
2. Build is sturdy with nice thick wires but not so thick they are unmanageable.
3. Can replace damaged wires without having to buy a while new pair with detachable ear piece"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered Shure SE210-A-K-EFS earphones 2 years ago (and loved these) and I needed a replacement for them. I figured these new earphones would be as good or better, but Shure has redesigned them and the earphones are now horrible. I could not use the orange foam sleeves that I prefer with these new earphones and none are provided. It took forever to figure out how to put them in my ears. They are a one size fits all and they don't fit my ears. There is a stiff wire that bends around your ear and if you wear sunglasses or glasses they will move the wire and pop the ear piece out of your ear. Once you figure out how to get the earphones in your ears they feel very uncomfortable. They actually hurt my ears. The sound was not as good as my old Shure earphones because the fit was so bad. The did not go into my ear far enough for me to hear full sound. I immediately arranged for a return and refund. I then purchased some Audio Technica over the ear earphones that a friend recommended. I will use them until Shure comes to their senses and designs an earphone that fits and is comfortable. I hope the people from Shure are reading my review. I am so disappointed with Shure's new earphones. I've owned Shure earphones for over 12 years and I will not buy them until they make changes to the fit."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great while it worked. Dead in less than two months. Seriously disappointing considering the sound and build quality of 535’s...I wish it would translate over to their Bluetooth cord.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good quality (expected from Shure) works great with my se215 drivers, call quality is superb, battery life is good, very happy! No issues or complaints."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones have excellent sound quality and the reinforced cable near the earpieces solves a problem I had with my last pair of Shure earbuds - the cable frayed near the earpieces after just a couple of months.

On the other hand, they don't do a very good job keeping out ambient noise. My active noise-cancelling headphones are much better at that."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst purchase ever. The trouble is with the detachable model of the earphones. Maybe I got a defective cable - or many people are having this issue - I have no idea. The earbuds keep detaching themselves from the main cable. The result is that I lost the left earbud twice. Support was good about replacing it once - the second time around they quoted a price of 78$ for replacing the lost earbud. Save yourself the trouble and buy a pair of the Bose Sport Model. Totally every cent worth the extra 30$.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off saying that for price on Amazon, the Klipsch headphones are a great buy. I have owned them for about 6 months before they started shorting out. Im not sure if it was the headphones themselves but I tend to run through earbuds rather quickly. That let start the direct comparison.

Comfort:
I would have to give a slight edge to the Klipsch headphones over the Shures here. The Klipsch soft ear sleeves just slide in but there is a pro and con to everything. The Shure's use a foam tip that expands in your ear. It creates a much better seal and therefore has better noise-isolation then the S4's. My ear sometimes feels a little discomfort after wearing them for a while but i may just need to switch the smaller sleeves they provide.

Secure Fit:
The SE215 has the clear advantage hear. The headphones are tricky to learn to get in but once you do the very nature of how the sit in the ear makes them much more secure. The headphone cord comes forward then loops over and behind the ear. Tugging on the cord rarely budges these things. Meanwhile, I have had problems with the S4's coming out, especially if I'm working out.

Ease of use:
The S4's have the edge here. You simply push them in. The SE215's require to roll the foam tips before you put them in to get the best seal and to loop the cord over your ear. that can be annoying if they fall out while running. That said they much less likely to fall out. The S4's have alternate of putting them in that involves looping the cord as well but i found it to be uncomfortable.

Noise-isolation:
Advantage goes the SE215s for the reasons mentioned before, the foam tips.

Construction:
Both seem well constructed. The SE215 feels more substantial and the cord is much thicker. It seems less prone to tangling.

Performance:
As i wrote this I listened to the same song once with each pair with the same EQ and volume settings. The SE215 were louder and sounded cleaner for the same songs and settings. The bass was deep and the highs were clear. The S4's are no slouch either. They outperform most other sub-$100 earbuds out there.

Bottom line:
Both are a great set of the headphones. The SE215's are $100 and the S4's are $60. Do the Shure's justify the extra $40? yes. but its all personal preference. The S4's are a steal for $60. That said I really appreciate the superior performance, fit, and noise-isolation."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's very convenience when you go wireless, easy to connect, great battery life
When I connected with my SE846s the sound is just acceptable, sound not powerful and not crisp, the sound stage not wide as with the stock cable
Sometime I faced sound lag and sometime its drop

BTW it's good Bluetooth upgrade for your Shure SE series if you think you can accept with a bit lower sound performance from your current SEs with a cable"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, but these don't fit my ears that well. I have been turning the over-the-ear part forward since they don't stay in my ears otherwise. They get uncomfortable after a while."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's disappointing because these are advertised as providing 37 dB of isolation, assuming a good fit using their foam earplug-like attachment. Here's my thoughts:

1. The shape is odd and clumsy, like sticking a yo yo in your ear.
2. The cord is long enough to skip rope with.
3. You need small hands and a death grip to remove the tips.
4. My over-the-ear, non-isolating Sennheiser's have better sound isolation.
5. Removing these and re-inserting takes time, so using these in the average workplace is out of the question.

As a basic test, take a cheap pair of store-bought earplugs, which typically provide 29-32 dB of isolation, and find a spot with some amount of background noise (low-volume television, etc...). With isolation this good, you should see someone's lips moving when they speak at normal volume, but you shouldn't hear even a whisper. These headphones don't even remotely come close to 37 dB of isolation. I'm assuming they used some sort of test device with inflatable ears to make this claim."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, very good sound! The only problem is that the soft part of the ear bud doesn't quite fit my ear, so the headphones tend to fall out. I tried putting another size on and they won't go on at all. I used the tool and read and reread the instructions and I can't figure out how to get the ear pieces to fit on there. Once I finally figure it out, this product will rock my ears off!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed new headphones for my ipod, something practical, yet with good sound quality. Before this I had the Klipsch S4, which provided really good sound quality, but the cable didn't last long... So after doing some research I got this ones, and I'm not totally happy about them. Yes, the sound quality is awesome, but they are really uncomfortable, they even kinda hurt, and just to get them on I need some sort of manual.

The other issue I have with them is the sound isolation feature. Even though it works incredibly, I never thought it would be an issue for when I went out and around. I like to listen music while commuting or just out walking, but adding to the fact that they are uncomfortable and hard to get on/off, it gets me slightly paranoid not to listen to anything around me but my music, just something to keep in mind... And even though I can't listen to anything around me, I can listen to my steps, and that can be really annoying...

So even though they are good at doing their job, we are not a good fit..."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont waste your money. I bought them thinking they would at least last a year based on their price. after less than a month of use the input plug doesn't work like any other cheap earphones out there. The earphones I had before this where 15 $ skullcandys which lasted 3 moths. You do the math.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great, exceeded my expectations.
The sound isolation is great, you just have to choose the right sleeve for your ear.
The buds don't fall out of my ear, so I take them everywhere I go.
They're great for workouts.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased in march 2017, used less than 10 times by august one side went out and and the other side is hardly working.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I fell in love with Shure SE-Series over 4 years ago. When I purchased my first pair of Shure SE-115's, great design: the wires were not too long and there was a nice ""break away jack"", so one could switch between sound systems. Very cool,
simple, and durable.
The new SE215-CL's are designed so that the stem insert part that goes into my ear canal, is not offset enough from the speaker. The bulk of the speaker causes an insecure seal with the foam (thats on the stem), causing the device to fall out of my ear. If the stem were longer, that would create better distance between the speaker and stem insert, so the foam could then sit and expand in my ear canal. A minor issue for me is the look of the newShure SE215-CL Sound Isolating Earphones SE215-CL, they remind me of hearing aids.
I'm a lover of simplicity and function, and I'll be the first one to buy the ""old"" style again, if Shure ever decides to bring back the SE115's."

The sound coming from them straight out of the box is incredible - really, just blows Klipsch out of the water (hey, it surprised me, too ;o) ). I could hear tones using these earphones that I never knew existed using the Klipsch. The sound is very well balanced and rich ~ clarity? outstanding!

I LOVE the slightly longer cable.

Watch out - the ear sleeves are really hard to change ... It was much easier to change detaching the cable and I used a toothpick to pry up under the sleeve ~ once I did that - it didn't take me two minutes to change them out (figuring that out of course took longer than that ;o) ) ...

It's taken me a little while to get used to the cord going over the ear style - but take them on and off a few times and it's no problem.

For the person who said the Noise Isolating was a ""con"" ~ to me, it's not - they are, after all, 'sound isolating' earphones right? It's a plus and it definitely works :o) (and there are warnings in teh packaging not to use in any place you *need* to hear surrounding noises)

Shure Se215- the sound is there but its not as clean and crisp as the klipsch

Mids: the mids on these things are decent listing to acoustics the guitar notes came though clean.

Vocals: the vocals of the se215 are not there; not present as the klipsch, it's not warm and clean like the klipsch and listing to fem voices, the vocals are some time a little up tempo un-natural sounding at times

Mids: the mids on are present when these are broken into or burned in the sound of these sound like there Refrence speakers every thing just sound so right and its not over powering

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I read plenty of reviews on Black Friday and CyberMonday this year and the reviews on this product seemed mostly positive. Now that I own a set I can claim that these are the most comfortable, best fitting earbuds I have ever tried. I started my earbud experience with Etymotics Research legendary 4s and 4p earbud. Etymotics Research is not only the inventors of in-the-ear earbuds, they won awards and top picks 10 years after release. The 4s model was compared to a $10,000 pair of headphones by an audiophile magazine review, convincing me to purchase them for about $350. They lasted 10 years.

I was a little surprised that the upper end of frequency range is 17.5Khz, a little low for human hearing (20 KHz). Bass response is fantastic, as long as you have selected the foam earpiece that fits well. The nice thing about the foam is that it is very soft, so I feel more comfortable with these than the Etymotic model. I feel I can use these all day. I like to listen at concert levels. Not very healthy but I can tell that there's no significant levels of distortion at louder volumes. Mids are full and clear, highs (tested with Chopin's Etude #5 -- a piano solo) are also clear and have great presence.

I'm sure things can only get better as these are broken in and I have spent time with them.

I've also picked up a pair of jvc xtreme xploders (both the higher end $50 metal model and the $20 cheaper model), which I would give a good review to, but for the price of the Shure's, I would recommend saving your money up and spending more -- after all you will be using these for many many hours. The Shure model is better fitting so bass response is going to be better. Of course, a poor fit on any earbud will give you tinny results. The initial earpieces on my xtreme xploders and the Shure SE215 were both too small, and gave that result."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for 3 years. Left ear just stopped working. Not clogged. I check the right ear on the left side and it works, so i know its not the wire. I checked the resistance of the speaker coils, left and right chanel....left speaker completly open. It just failed. One minute they were working, the next silence....always listen at a casual volume. 3 years it not to bad I guess, thats why i gace it 4 stars, and they do sound very nice.

Same time the left speaker died, the right speaker wire ( metal wire to allow to stay bent around the ear) broke, poked through the casing and stabbed my ear, lol.

So it seems they have a 3 year life give or take before it starts t break down.

100 bucks seems high to me for these, but after 3 years of constant use, its nnot such a bad price tag."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What you get: One pair of clear colored Shure SE215 in-ear ear buds that have a silver cable with a standard 3.5mm plug, a small carrying case; and interchangeable small, medium, and large ear 'sleeves' in two different styles.
What they're for: Listening to audio with the use of a separate media device.
About the reviewer: I purchased these on Amazon.com and have owned them for about 5 months. I'm a musician and an audiophile enthusiast who uses these ear buds with my phone and computer to listen to metalcore, EDM, pop, and rap.

5. Value 9/10
These ear buds are well made and sound great! They are made with a clear plastic, which is cool because you can see the wires and driver housings on the inside. The clear ear pieces will match anything you're wearing. A layer of flexible Kevlar protects the first couple inches of cable coming from the ear pieces. The cable itself is made of woven silver and bronze material and wrapped again by plastic tubing.

The shape of the ear pieces' bodies contour perfectly to rest snug in your ear, and an assortment of exchangeable sleeves ensures a tailored fit. The orientation of these ear buds are designed to have the cable run up and over your ear, and then back down. Although previous reviews (Amazon.com, 2015) reported that these ear buds can be worn the traditional way, with the cable hanging straight down. There will be no problems using these ear buds while you're active, but keep in mind these ear buds are isolating and you will not be able to hear the outside world while using them.

Their sound is produced from a single speaker in each ear. These ear buds are the least expensive ear buds in a line modeled after Shure's original in-ear stage performance monitors, which were well received by live performing musicians who needed a way to hear themselves in noisy venues. Higher models in this line have more speakers for each ear.

All ear phones, headphones, and speakers are 'colored'; set to specs usually determined by an executive or the companies R&D department. It's color is a natural EQ that stems from the speakers hardware and physical components. These ear buds have exceptionally honest sound reproduction. If you like overstated bass or high end then you might perceive these ear buds to sound flat, because they do. These ear buds can produce sound at nearly the entire range of human hearing.

The only thing these ear buds are missing compared to others in the same price range is an inline microphone for making calls on your mobile device or computer. But the cool thing is that each ear piece is detachable from the cable. So you can replace the cable with an after market one that does have a mic-if you need it. This feature would also be useful if the cable or either ear piece were to break. Since the whole thing is modular you could just replace the broken component instead of the whole thing.

Overall, these ear buds are excellent value. At a $100 price point you are not likely to find a better combination of good looks, durability, and phenomenal sound. These ear buds would be good for any discerning music fan, but they would also work well for audiophiles on a budget."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't bother spending more for the higher Shure SE models. These sound balanced and accurate and sound isolating is definitely the way to go. I use these while I work (desk job) and on Sundays when performing.

The only caution I can provide is that it's generally not a good idea to wear these anywhere where hearing outside ambient noise is beneficial. (e.g. jogging, driving, etc.) -- as these are extremely good at blocking outside noise.

One really nice improvement (over my black SE215 copy) was that they finally added a plastic grid/mesh slightly inside the foam piece. This prevents earwax from getting into the actual ear piece. Now earwax is confined and far easier to clean/deal with.

Having trouble figuring out which one ear piece belongs in which ear; left or right? I had originally found it annoying that I couldn't see/read the ""L"" and ""R"" on each earpiece like I could on my black pair... but that was only until I discovered that each ear piece has a color coded ""dot"" indicating left and right channel. (red for right, blue for left). It also doubles as the point where you need to line up the ear piece should you wish to replace the cable."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older pair of Shure earphones, the E2C I think. They were great until the cables got slammed in the door, exposing the wiring, and had to be replaced. I bought some Klipsch ones based on excellent reviews, but I hated them in comparison to my old Shures. The Klipsch ones got stolen (good luck with those awful earphones sucker!) I couldn't find the E2Cs, but these seemed comparable--Shure earphones for around $100. These are great, maybe better than the E2Cs. They are ""noise-cancelling"" in the way that they fill up your ear canal with a tight seal--great for airplanes, etc. without the big-old active noise cancelling devices. Seriously, I've had people talking to me and I can't hear a word until I remove them. Great sound reproduction, especially deep bass. I love them. If I had to pick a downside, they are a bit bulkier than say the stock iPod pieces of trash, but these are fine for running, working out, etc. I wouldn't cycle with them just because you wouldn't be able to hear any upcoming cars or other road hazards. Another good thing about these--if you work out hard and sweat like I do, you build up earwax in the canal of the earphone. These come with a special wire-loop device specifically built for cleaning that out! Keep up the good work Shure."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Deep and powerful bass, outstanding forward mid range, only bad thing is the highs tend to get rolled off though they seem to get better as you keep listening to them. If the highs are not enough for you, its nothing a little bit of EQ can fix. Like many IEM's, try driving this with an amp or just pump more volume with the device you're listening with. That's where they really shine, especially the bass. Overall, amazing sound, I just feel that the clarity of the highs could have been better.

The over the ear design and may be uncomfortable for some, but soon you'll learn to appreciate the ergonomics the SE215 has to offer. They sit almost perfectly in your ear, and its design helps block outside noise, and it does so VERY well. Just make sure you got the right ear tips (These come with 3 sizes of foam, and 3 sizes of silicone rubber ear tips) to ensure maximum seal and comfort. If none of them work out, there are always alternatives like the Westone True Fit, Westone Star Tips (Which are my favourite as of now) or Comply foam tips."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't expect that a set of ear buds would be able to replace my over ear noise cancelling Audiotechnica headphones. Boy was I wrong! These things sound amazing and the sound isolation is very effective. They look nice everything about them feels high quality.

My biggest complaint is that I had a very difficult time figuring how to put them on. I never would have thought I would be searching Youtube for videos to find out how to put a set of ear buds in my ears but for the first few days that I had them this is what I was doing. It may take you a few tries to figure out how to get them in and sealed properly. Myself, I squish the black foam sleeves then press them into my ear, not just stick them in, actually use some force and press them in and then make a downward twist motion to settle the body into my ear. After a few seconds the foam has expanded and is blocking outside noise. Once you figure out how to insert them you will be very happy!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, and their sound isolation is pretty intense. I have to take them out of my ears to hear people talking loudly to me, which is a great way to focus while working. Overall their sound is slightly ""warm"", with maybe a bit more pronounced midrange, but I have found it quite comfortable to listen to music and podcasts for long periods of time while I work.

At first the cable over the ear threw me off, but once I acclimated to the different fit (my previous experience was Apple earbuds) I can never go back."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the headphones while they lasted. I have had them for less than three months. I was about to use them, turned them on (according to the headphones, the battery had 6 hours left). They connected to my phone and suddenly nothing happens. Button does not seem to work, no audible messages or anything. I have tried charging the headphones, but even that doesnt work.

Very disappointed since I have had them less than a few months and only use them while going on long walks (which is not that often)."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these things.

I bought these mainly for traveling on airplanes and they work amazingly. The foam tips are great, easy to put in (Just like foam ear plugs) and they block a good bit of noise.

Sound quality is pretty good as well. i am sure the're better sound quality headphones available, but for the price these things are great.

Read other reviews about the poor cable quality. I've only had these for a month or so and don't use them everyday so I can't speak to the quality yet. I do plan on wrapping them to avoid issues just to be on the safe side."

They're cumbersome and awkward to get them on. Forget the ability to just push them in your ear. They have to be oriented in a certain direction and then you have to make sure the cords go up over your ears.

Once I finally got them on, a side-by-side test of the same song showed that they had no better sound quality than my JAYS T00075 A-Jays Four (which I also bought here on Amazon for $22).

I've been a big fan of Shure mics for years. This was my first time trying out their headphone products. On one hand, I'm tempted to think that the sound quality might be better if I continue up the ladder and buy one of their more expensive options.....but then I think:

A. Why should I need to spend more money to sound as good as a pair of Jays $22 earbuds?
B. And would buying a higher priced model make them any less cumbersome to put on?

Have to look at the ""r"" and ""l"" signs every time, and even then I'm futzing with them for a couple of minutes before they are in properly... and that stupid stiff wire is always twisting the wrong way so you have to keep pulling it back over your ear.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Son pleased with gift and use of ear buds.He is using them in worship team sound system and feels they work well. Won't use them for jogging cause too much outside sound blocked & he wouldn't be able to hear activity around him when running.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For a very low cost IEM, this is definitely the best and most affordable for price range under 100."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a drummer, I have used SEVERAL ""In Ear"" and ""Over Ear"" headphones...For the money these are by far the best that I have purchased."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These replaced a pair of monster turbines. The Shure have a better range of sound, but the turbines bass was way better. I like the way the earbuds are attached and can swivel. The cable is very sturdy and I have no worries about it being damaged (The cable is what broke on my turbines). I am happy with these but wish they had more bass."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and block out a lot of the outside noise so you can hear the music well. This is my second pair of these guys.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Took a while to get used to, and to find the right ear bud. But when I did, wow."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't do may reviews, I do it just for products I consider either really good or really bad. These monitors are part of the former group. The sound is amazing. Low, mid and high frequencies are masterfully balanced. I used to have the Shure E2C, and although they sound good, I wasn't thrilled about their bass. I'm not a bass head, but I like to be able to hear the presence of drums and bass in my music. Although the E2Cs did a good job, they were not excellent. The SE215 blow the E2Cs out of the water in every single part of the sound spectrum. I don't think you need a burn-in period with these (although I burned them in for about 14 hrs beforefirst use).

Fit is just great, extremely comfortable, much better than the E2Cs. They isolate outside noise very well. I just bought them and I am extremely happy. At this price, it is a no brainer."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love the way these things sound but after only a couple of months of use the cord has turned green with oxidation. They worked for a little while longer but the right side has stopped working all together. I would never purchase these headphones because of the design flaw that causes this to happen. What a waste of money these were!!
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of wireless headphones. I've own a few shure products and a selection of wired and wireless earphones, but these are by far the best pair I've owned. I use the wireless adapter with my e535 earphones as well.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand the reviews, honestly. These are uncomfortable and the sound is flat. I'd rather waste my money on Beats and at least give the appearance that I'm enjoying my listening experience. Save your money and buy a pair of socks instead."

They sound great, but only after a month the left headphone stopped working. It was not damaged or abused so I can only assume it is a fallowed unit."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very quickly, the sound is great but the ear buds are very difficult to insert. Despite a couple weeks of effort, they still take quite a bit of time to get the wires just right that they can be inserted."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the buck you can't beat these. I gig every weekend and play at church...these in-ears will SAVE your eardrums from the constant beating and drone of live music, plus you sing a lot better if you can hear yourself."

I have had these headphones for about a week, and they seem sturdy, and feel fine in my ear. However, the sound is very fuzzy."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think if you have never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones these might be OK. However, they are no where near as good when it comes to quietness. In addition, you hear the cord movement and they are not that comfortable."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply a great audio quality for a reasonable price. If you like high quality audio but do not have the budget for an over 300 dollars pair of headphones, I would highly recommend this. The dettachable cable is a great ad so you can replace it and not buy a whole new pair of headphones and the bass is heavenly clear."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I give it to stars because it works. I really should take one away though, because it Cuts in and out. I already had a set of the earbuds, SE 215’s, And very much enjoyed those. However the quality of this product is very very poor! I am highly disappointed"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you very much ! have a good time !
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While the noise cancellation worked well, the low range bass seemed non existent. Even doing bass boost on iPod was not enough. Also the in-ear fit was difficult. Overall very disappointed in the product. Bought Bose ear buds for same price and am very happy."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are everything they are supposed to be.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've previously owned the E2C which I liked but like many users had experienced, mine broke 3 times within 2 years because of exposed copper wires. Although Shure would replace them for free each time they broke but it was still quite annoying. There're a few things that I really like about the SE215 in comparison to the E2C:

-The packaging is extremely easy to open. I no longer have to slice open a rock with my scissors/cutter just to get the earphones out.

-Comes with a earwax removal tool which is helpful in keeping them clean.

-Stronger bass and better overall sound quality.

-The cord does seem a tad sturdier and is detachable, which allows easier replacement just in case it breaks again. But I hope it won't come down to that.

If I'm not mistaken, these earphones come with a 2-year warranty during which Shure will replace your earphones for free. More info at:

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The first time I ordered these the left side had a bad connection and would only work on occasion so I sent them back and ordered a new pair. I just got the second pair out of the box and it's doing the exact same thing. It looks like I'm not the only one who has had this problem either. This company is a joke.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were great until they stopped working. I have had them for 3 months, treated them well but the left ear bud stopped working. I expected more from sure. Very displeased"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I am on my 2nd pair because the packaging smooshes the right medium foam ear plug which is my size. It doesn't pop back out and because it is already compressed down it isn't filling my right ear canal. The left one works perfect. The other two included sizes are worthless because they don't fit. I thought the first one was a fluke but just got my second set and it is the same thing. It is pretty annoying. I have a flight coming this week and will try. I see in the reviews they say give a week.... Bad packaging Shure. Someone in your design dept wasn't paying attention."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lose one star for price. These aren't just fancy earbuds. They provide superior sound. The cords are heavier duty than any I've found and it's snag free. If you need to listen to audio in a noisy environment, such as a motorcycle, airplane, or factory, I cannot stress how well these block out ambient noise. I would never have spent this much on these if they hadn't been recommended by a long distance motorcycle rider. He was correct. These are worth it. Excellent purchase."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better cable than before
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fine product, clear sound, well made and sturdy -- what you'd expect for the price. Unfortunately, not a great fit for my elephantine ears. Also, make sure you're comfortable with cords looping over your ears first."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily the best earbuds I've ever owned, and that's listening to them before I burn them in.

Let's temper that statement - I have only owned apple stock buds, a few different $15~$20 sets of earbuds, monster turbines, and these. The only real competitor here is the turbines, and surprisingly, I'd guess because of Shure's use of a dynamic driver in this model, the Shures blow the monsters away in bass punch and clarity.

I have small canals, and I actually LIKE silicone inserts - the small silicone inserts fit beautifully.

Depending on the shape of your ear you might have a less comfortable fit, but these buds feel like they were crafted to fit perfectly in my outer ear.

The sound is great, full and rich and with a more powerful bass punch than I'd predicted. As an extra plug, SoundEarphones managed to deliver them to my door a full 2 days before the 1st expected arrival date. I'm going to start burning in these headphones tonight and plan to wear them enough to start bumping into people accidentally.

Edit: Thanks to a comment from another user I changed these from 4/5 to 5/5 since I really shouldn't reserve a higher rating for a more expensive pair of earphones. These Shures are most likely the best set for this price point.

1 more thing: Very glad I went with clear instead of black, they look really impressive."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful sound. Came from a set of Ultimate Ears and these have a stronger low end, but still a very rich sound throughout the range. Still working on the fit to get it where it'll sit naturally and comfortably, but that will come."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The earphone is rough. It seems like be renovated. The sound is same to the iPhone's earphone.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most well known iem's in the business. I orderd a pair of 1 more triple driver to begin with but then kept thinking how the shures would do. Shures are a single driver compared to the 3 drivers of the one more, 1 dynamic and 2 armature balancers. I tested them both and can say buy the one more tripple driver. They are the same price but the one more should cost more. The shure are not ergonomic, you can't lay down with them and they have no online Remote as well as having a reputation for falling apart. I won't tell you all the features of the 1 more, go look at them on amazon. All in all the 1more sounds sooooo much better than the shures. The shures offer better lows, but only by a pinch. Everything abounds better with 1 more"

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these earphone is atrocious. Is it possible that I bought a fake? Can't believe Shure would make such a terrible product. Returning it right away.

He really tried to act excited and grateful but they were uncomfortable in his ears. I did return them and had no problem with the return of refund. So there was a positive to the experience. May work well for others but not for my hubby
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No sound from one of the earbuds after about a month. Shure's customer service is terrible and their returns policy was clearly designed before the internet was invented. Wouldn't buy from shure again.

Sounded nice for the month they worked though."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good but the cable for the right ear seems to have broken or something. They only sounded good anf at equal levels for about 10 minutes. I've never had a pair of headphones so frail, really bad manufacturing."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know I could probably do better with a more expensive set of ear buds like the Shure SE315 or se425 but for the price these things kick ass! I work in a very loud wood mill factory , and these things drowned out all the noes. I hook them up to a Fiio Andes E07K on to my Galaxy Note 2 and it rocks!

They handle the bass extremely well seeing how I got it tweaked out with Poweramp Music player for Android.

cons: they do take a little time to mount onto your head. and get all my gear up and running but it's sooo worth it.

If you mount them properly like they tell you to there is no line nose. the complaints about line nose is BS"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had other ear buds from Shure that I loved and had great sound, so I trusted the company and bought these as a replacement.

But they're not good! I don't know what the other people reviewing them have been listening to, but there are songs that I know have a low bass, which can't be heard on these at all. They're also surprisingly uncomfortable because the buds themselves are really thick and the hard plastic is actually jamming itself against my ear (no change in the latex piece helps this problem).

But mostly, they have no low bass (I listen to a lot of electronic music-- they're the worst for psytrance!) and are pretty much only acceptable for listening to podcasts. I lent them to a friend who was surprised that Shure made them because they're so bad.

Not worth the money! When I listen to songs I know, I am disappointed with the sound quality."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had the earbuds for less than 20 minutes and the left bud started cutting out. I returned it immediately.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I need noise canceling earphones and already familiar with SHURE products, I opted to buy a pair of Live Sound monitors. I find them awkward to use because they have to be adjusted over the ear each time you use them. The wire is soft and once you take them out, the wire straightens itself out. The purpose of buying this kind of monitor was so that I could place them over my ears, so twisting each one into place each time I used them was annoying. The left one shorted out from turning.The RT. ear is marked in red, the left in blue. You must find this color each time you use them. They are fragile and would not stay in the shape I had placed them. Although the sound effect was good, the product is substandard in my opinion. SHURE is generally a good brand too buy, but not this product."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took a little getting used to at first, but after a week or so these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I have owned. They fit just right in your ear and don't randomly fall out."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE215-CL as a replacement for my Beats earbuds. The sound quality was quite impressive. Solid bass, good mids and highs. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of the left earbud became erratic the next day and any movement caused the sound to drop out. It was probably a defective unit, so I decided to return them. Shipping was excellent as I received them the day after I placed the order. Great Customer Service as vendor offered to replace them."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. The sound is amazing and so clear but they are hard to keep in my ears. It is easier if you keep both buds in your ear though.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned the SE115's and absolutely love them. The ""only"" issue is that I've gone through about 3 pairs in the past 18 months due to damaging the cable, so Kevlar is a must from here on out.

The sound quality between the SE115's and the SE215's is indistinguishable to me, so no issues there. The fit is entirely different though, and I have yet to find a sleeve that creates a perfect seal to get the best base response and not hurt my ears. The other potential issue is that the part of the cable near the headphone has a hard, 3 inch protective plastic cover around it, which is great for protection but means the headphone gets knocked out of place easily when the cable is touched.

To sum up:

Pro's: Sound quality, Kevlar, fits flat against your ears (great for listening to music while in bed)
Con's: Less snug than the SE115's, protective plastic cover makes it easier to knock the headphones out of place."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Those giant bose in their carrying case take up SO much room in your carry-on, don't they? Well these are your new airplane solution. The foam part that goes in your ear is made of earplug material, so you squish it and it does its part to block noise without being this huge thing on top of your ear. They pack up compact and are my new favorite traveler's secret. When I am playing music or podcasts on my phone with the normal white iphone style headphones (not even on an airplane!) I have to turn my volume all the way up. When I am listening to music on a noisy airplane with these headphones I have my volume one click above silent - that's how noise isolating these are. I love them. I know they're a little pricey but compared to the fancy bose they're a bargain."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have a great, balanced sound with a surprising amount of detail and clarity considering they only have the one micro driver.

Replaceable cable is sure to add to the lifetime of these. Also the cable itself is of the highest quality I've ever seen. Noticeable micro vibrations are a thing of the past with these. And there going to take a real beating to cause damage to them.

The case is alright but it's not really going to protect the buds if you sit/step on it or anything. It's purpose is mostly to make it more convenient to transport them, witch it performs admirably. You can order a harder case that comes with the more expensive versions if your worried about it (there fairly cheap to) but it's not really an issue for the way I'll be using them.

And now for my one issue with these. Removing the tips. This isn't something you'll do often once you found your size thankfully but when I first got them I obviously wanted to try them all to get the best seal/fit. These suckers are hard to get off, the foam ones in particular because you have to use so much pressure it feels like your going to tear the foam. Fortunately the foam was more resilient then I anticipated and they regained there shape without any noticeable damage. My other concern was that the tip they slide on to is plastic. You can tell its a thicker good quality plastic but with the way it sticks out combined with the pressure needed to swap tips I was sure that it was going to crack.

Maybe I'm just a little to paranoid and I understand they don't want the tips sliding at all but the tightness applied here seems a bit excessive to me.

In closing I'd say Sure just made themselves a new fan and in the future I'll be looking to get some 535's. If they can get this great a sound with one simple micro driver I can only imagine what 3 hi-def drivers with a passive crossover sounds like."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high because I've been a shure fan for years, but these were so disappointing that I returned them. First, they feel very cheap. I have a pair of Beats X and Bose Soundsport. Shure needs to use a higher quality wire. It is extremely thin. I think that what did me in was the bluetooth connection. I can listen with my BeatsX until the battery dies without missing a beat. The Shure headphones would cut out every few minutes. I just became very annoying and distracting."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earphones because I had this collegue at work who would constently talk very loudly, which prevented me from beeing able to concentrate on the tasks I had to perform at work. These earphones are a mix between earplugs and actual earphones. With these I can concentrate on my work without being bothered byambiant noise. The downside is that I don't hear my phone ringing. The sound quality is good but not as good as my koss porta pro earphones Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case. When there is no ambiant noise, I prefere to use the latter."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great! The ""noise isolation"" works very well by block out sounds from entering your ear. Not like the ""noise cancellation"" type of earphones at send a signal into your ear to counter outside noise. I use the silicone ear pieces. The set also comes with expanding foam ear pieces that work even better for noise isolation. The foam pieces are like those a construction worker or gardener (with a leaf blower) would use. You squeeze it and stuff it in your ear and it expands to fit the contours of the inside of your ear, forming a nice seal for ""isolation."" They stay in the ear really well. But for me, even the smallest size started to bother me after awhile by putting excess pressure to the inside of my ear, so I'm sticking with the silicone ones. I'm happy the set came with so many options. The stethoscope effect is very minimal. The loop around the ear takes some getting used to and is a little awkward at first, but once you have it molded around your ear, it works well."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome IEMs. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and this was no exception. Sound quality is pretty good without an amp, and when driven a bit sound amazing. Don't be fooled into thinking you need a ton of drivers to monitor a single instrument. I play the bass, and these are great for practicing. If you're planning on doing stage monitoring or some other inputs at once maybe look into IEMs with more drivers.
I do notice some pinging reverberations when audio is cut off abruptly, but it might be my old amp.
The removable cable is also great, you can find replacement or upgrade cables elsewhere on amazon. Also the multitude of replaceable eartips are a good inclusion, I'm currently using the small foam ones so I can insert most of the assembly into my ear, but the silicone tips are acceptable as well."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on sound quality and noise reduction these get a solid 5 Stars, but I'm docking them two stars because I'm on my third pair in less than five years. At $100 a pop, I wish they have more than a 1 1/2 year average lifespan. I really do love them, they sound amazing and do a fantastic job of quieting the world during a busy public commute, but I'm deeply annoyed that they implode so quickly, and I do take impeccable care of them, handle them gently, listen at moderate volume on average of 8-10 hours a week, designated case, clean regularly. It's also worth noting that my first two pairs died the same way, an audible pop and loss of the left channel, not a slow degrade of quality, but a sudden short.

If this latest pair follows the same pattern, I'll be looking for a new brand unfortunately."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great earbuds. The same quality you'd expect from Shure and the regular SE215s, now with BT. Like other 215s, you can change out the wire if it wears out instead of replacing the whole device. I'd recommend going and reading one of the countless other reviews of the regular 215s if you are curious about sound and build quality of the earbuds themselves. I'll cover the BT differences, though.

There are three controls on the device - volume up, down, and the power/answer and end phone call button. The inline microphone is really clear over the two calls I've had today. I asked the person on the other line if they could hear a difference, and they said I sounded great. There's also a LED indicator light, which could honestly be a little larger and in a more convenient spot. I also noticed it was hard to tell what side of the wire was the left and right - I wish there were larger or more visible indicators there. There's also a ladies voice that warns you of your current battery levels when they are getting low and when you turn the device off and on.

Overall, this is a great quality pair of earbuds! Especially at this price point. I've tried the Airpods, and at the same price point, these blow them out of the water."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For an earbud, the sound is fantastic. I'd actually rate these as sounding slightly BETTER than ATH-M50s. The sound isolation too is really, really good. Basically, if you like music but don't want to drop bank, these are what to get.

That said, they're quite uncomfortable. After 2 hours of listening, the inside of your pinna WILL hurt from the plastic body rubbing it. Also, putting them in takes practice, and is certainly not fast. Compared to my old ""jam them in your ear canal and go"" Sennheiser CX500s, these require a good 30 seconds or more to put in, between positioning the bud, wrapping the hard piece of wire around your ear, etc. And once they're in, they're in. Even if you swap the soft tip for the silicone (which took me 10 minutes and a youtube guide the first time), these are VERY isolating. Expect to not hear anything short of a concert around you.

So there you go. Very quirky and a pain, but they sound outstanding, especially for the price."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"( I listen to different styles, but most of the time - black metal, death, doom, goth and industrial. )

SE215-K are Amazing little earphones!!! After burn-in the sound quality is getting close to my $400 Denon D2000s. A little less bass (but still enough), but SE215-K have more natural (realistic) sound. SE215-K don't need to be amp'ed, I didn't hear any difference. They need to be deep in ears to get sufficient sound isolation (up to -26 db) and great bass. Carrying case is nice and useful! They look very good (in ears and in hands :) ) Big plus that they give me less sound pressure on my ears than D2000s do.

I would recommend these earphones to everyone, unless you have a budget to get 535s, UE reference monitors or sennheiser IE800 :)

I've had Shure headphone in the past and the cords need to be replaced very often. I'm sure these are not that different. Plus the replacement cords are very expensive for this version. For a $100+ cost, you should not have to replace the cords. A better buy is the Panasonic RPHJE120P In-Ear Headphone. It fits well, has good sound quality and only costs $5."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure se215 uses a dynamic driver, so does Sennheiser in their ie 800 IEMs. These IEMS are the best by far in this price range, extra awesome earphones. Shure uses dynamic microdrivers with the Shure se215 and the se112 IEMs, which I could not tell the difference in sound, when I compared these to the 1000 dollar Shure se846, I VERY, VERY, MUCH WANTED THE se846 Shure to be far better than my se215s and se112s, I switched back and fourth between these IEMs at least 30 times and could not detect a difference in sound quality, only that I had to turn them up a notch or two. I am very sorry to say that the se846 Shures which uses moving armatures, found in hearing aides are going back. The Shure se846 are a fantasticly great IEMs but so are the se112 and se215, Shure just uses two completely different ways of achieving the same awesome results. Shure was really onto something with their great sounding dynamic microdrivers, they should go back and see what else they can do with the exceptional Shure dynamic microdriver, Sennheiser came up with the ultimate ie 800 IEM using a micro dynamic driver. I think that the Shure se112 and the se215 sound so incredibly fantastic, because they are the gateway to all other Shure earphones, why climb the ladder and continue the journey if these IEMs are average or mediocre? Plus Shure foam tips are not included with the se112 IEMs which make the IEM sound 40% better."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent a few days researching what earbuds to get and eventually decided on the Shure SE215. After receiving them and using them for a day I'm returning them the next.

I would only recommend these headphones if you're a single use person. If you're plugging them into one device and one device only and not transporting them around. The sound quality is quite good but other than that everything else about these are very poor. They do have a lot more bass however than the comparable BOSE earbuds.

The style of these are extremely outdated. You can feel it from the cord, see it by the length and the plug is designed to go right into the input. If you have a case on your iPhone or other unit, you won't be able to use the SHURE headphones with it. So again if you're single use like the laptop, then it's probably okay. The earbuds are extremely difficult to take off and change out, while also being awkward to put on.

I had to give these a one-star because after I took my case off of my phone to use them at the gym, sound wouldn't come out of both earbuds only one. If the plug was turned just the right direction it would come out of both, but this is difficult to do. Returning them after one day of use."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best pair of $100 IEMs out there. A relatively neutral soundscape with punchy bass (not overwhelming though). Highly recommended for the price range.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these when I first got them, like my favorites. I replace my beats with them. Stayed in my ear, sound great, clear highs, full bass (for earbuds). Unfortunately after a 2 months, where the wires connect with the earbud there is a swivel, this seems great at first because they don't tangle. Its the downfall, tons and tons of static noise in your earbuds after little use."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Shure earphone for many years and have been pleased with the quality and durability. The SE series, however, uses a connector at the base of the earpiece which creates a poor sound quality when engaging in exercise such as running. Apparently the connector pin used to attach the cord to the earbud rotates within the fitting when the user is engaged in movement. A cutting in and our of the sound results. The review and recommended self-repair at the following link is informative: [...]. Bottom line: Don't use these earphones if you intend to exercise while wearing them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The audio is fine but the bluetooth implementation is pure garbage. Everyone else seems to have bluetooth figured out. Shure should stick to what they do best and this ain't it!

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"April 4, 2015. Well, I guess I should have listened to folks who cautioned about poor quality. Purchased the Shure SE215 from Amazon on Dec 6, 2014. Now less than 4 months later, the left earbud does not work. I use these VERY LIGHTLY. Only during plane travel, probably twice a month. I listen to classical music a lot and have many full ear phones and ear buds. Last few years I have been very happy with Sennheiser and Klipsch, but wanted to try Shure. Guess I'm sorry now. The SE215 are still under warranty (2 years) , but I have to pay to return ship. Poor quality and now I have to $$ and take the time to send, what a hassle. I'll update this review when I hear back from Shure. But for the moment, four months of very limited use, and they don't work, so one star (one star only because zero star is not an option, they're broke.)"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This rating would be drastically different (5-stars) except for one extremely annoying “feature” of the Bluetooth functionality:

When the battery gets “low” which is under 10%, every 2 minutes the headphones stop your music playback and announce “battery low”. Every. Two. Minutes. I know the battery is low, let me enjoy the last bit of battery I have left to listen to my music, not to the robotic voice constantly reminding me that the battery is low.

Also to pile on, headphones only report 100%, 70%, 40% and 10% via Bluetooth battery reporting to iPhone. That’s way too big a gap for reporting battery life. 10% steps would be acceptable, 30% steps are near useless.

*While writing this review, the headphones told me “BATTERY LOW” 3 times."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The design on these however is absolutely terrible and they are not sustainable. The jack was a pretty loose fit on my standard iphone 5s and over time got looser and looser to the point where even a slight motion would dislodge them. These are completely useless if you intend to run or eve walk with them since they fall out of the jack so easily. Additionally putting these headphones in is a pain and cant be done in a cold weather. In warm weather sweat can easily cause these to slide out of your ears. Basically these headphones are now only good for staying completely still listening to music. I guess if you want to do that the sound quality is alright the highs and mids are clear but the bass is a little lacking.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For extremely expensive headphones, you could get better ones for cheaper. The sound isn't as crisp as others. Not as clear. I gave them away for free. I personally like my Sennheisers better."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not impressed with either the comfort (even after purchasing additional earbud tips) or the sound quality. I usually listen to music from my Nexus 6p phone. The SE215-K didn't have a lot of volume ($30 pair of wired earbuds from a truck stop were louder) when connected to my phone, but were decent when connected to my desktop. I found the ear wrap piece to be confusing and irritating when orienting the ear buds to go into your ear canal. I expected more from a $100 pair of earbuds with reviews as high as these are on Amazon."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used it immediately and fell in love with it. The sound was awesome and the snug fit was great! Great product!
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Are they good? Well yes. They worth the money. But! You're gonna need to spend another $50 to get Shure Phone Cable if you want to listen music on your phone. Why? Because the plug on default cable is so annoyingly bad it will lose connection with the phone on every slightest move. Even if you don't need a mic, you still gonna need to buy the cable. And you cannot get earphones with already installed phone cable.

I miss a pin on the cable. It's slightly heavier than other earphone cables and absolutely needs something that you can pin it to the shirt.

Also Shure support left me unhappy. One of the sleeves came damaged. There is a few spares each of different size, but you get only two medium ones. So I asked them to send me one. They told me to call them and order. Here on Amazon, those spares listed for $20. I explained them that the sleeve came damaged, and just because of one sleeve I don't want to send the whole thing back. They refused to send me a replacement and it seems after all I'm gonna need to spend another 20 and buy them myself.

So in the end these earphones will cost me in total ~ $170+tax. Is there any better options for that price? Sure, there are plenty. Good headphones, but they trick you to spend more.

BTW. It took me almost a month to find a way to properly get them in my ears. Remember, place the earpiece the way that logo would be laying horizontally and would be readable (it should not be upside down), and then turn the cable downwards, so the whole thing will look like G letter and not the way how it looks on the picture. At the point where cable connects to the earpiece, it easily rotates. And don't waste your time bending the cable behind your ears as it says in the manual."

The Shure SE215 has a great, balanced sound. It's among the best that I have had (under $150 budget).
Built quality is great, with detachable cable. It feels nice in the ear, but I didn't like the cord. It is thick and heavy.
It's as thick as a USB cable for example. The cords weigh twice Sony's and three times the Bose and Klipsch ones. (Yes, I actually put them on a scale).

The sound isolation is better than the others. But it also suffers the common problem with all noise isolation phones.
You hear your own body walking, especially when the cord touches you.
Overall I think Sony XB60EX gives you the same level for lower money.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this headset in January 2013 and the sound is already starting to cut out (as if the wires are pinched). I only use them while sitting at my desk for work (very light use).
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sorry to say that I am relatively disappointed in these IEM's. I listen almost entirely to heavy/death metal and bought these because I read numerous reviews that they are amazing for this genre, because if you listen to this genre as well you know it is hard to find good headphones for it. Well, these IEM's kind of suck for this genre. In general (for all genres) the bass is weak, if you set an iPod's EQ to hip hop to boost the bass the head phones can't handle it and give that crunchy plastic distorted sound when the bass hits. I compared the same exact songs with the same EQ to the free Apple headphones and those did not distort the bass and sounded much better than the SE-215's. If the EQ was off there was almost no bass presence in any song. The mid's and hi's are pretty good, the hi's don't overkill like most headphones. The build quality is ok, it is very difficult to disconnect the cable from the monitors, which is good, but I'm starting to have the infamous left monitor intermittent connection issue after just a month of owning them. The audio connector is way too huge, you can't use it with about 95% of iPhone cases. The sound isolation really is amazing, I don't use the foam tips included because they are impossible to take off and you pretty much have to destroy them to take them off, but the silicon ones are just as good at sound isolation. The chord is about 3 ft too long, and the memory wire near the monitors is just way too stiff and makes it difficult, even when formed to your ears, to keep the buds from pivoting about the bud and sticking out of your ear. The cable construction is very good, I feel confident they won't break because of frayed wires. But I have also tested these with hip hop, pop, dubstep, techno and rock. And really they don't sound that good, they are pretty much on the same level, if not lower than the free Apple headphones just with a more
Comfortable fit and significantly more inconvenience. I will say that if you listen mainly to acoustic music, with no bass, then these are the headphones for you. I really wish I could return these now. I'll probably sell them and buy the Klipsch S4's or whatever that everyone recommends."

First thing is these things are a bit of a hassle to figure out. The short instructions don't explain much. Finally went online and saw a video and figured out that you have to wrap the wire around your ear yourself. Does it cost that much to put an L on the left bud and an R on the right?

Second, once you get past that, the ear buds come with the middle size foam already attached. Now if you don't want the foam or have smaller or bigger ears, then you've got to yank really hard to get the foam off the ear buds, and I mean hard. And as you are doing this, it really feels like the small stem upon which the foam sits is going to break.

And last but not least, once I got the correct foam size on and figured out how to put them on, the sound quality was horrific. And I don't mean just bad. I mean awful, bad radio with a dying battery bad.

For nearly $100, I expected some really top notch ear buds. But what you get is really a mess. Hard to put on, foam pieces hard to take off and put on, and miserable sound quality. Like I said, these are not just bad, but horrific.

I got a pair of wrap around ear buds with a microphone included when I purchased a Rosetta Stone course and that little system is like 10x better than this.

Like I said, I'm not sure what's going on with these, but I absolutely don't recommend them."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been purchasing shure earbuds for 4+ years. A common problem among the last three I possessed is that around the 1-2 yr mark the wiring right where the chord connects to the earbud would start to fray. I'm a stubborn individual and have been convinced that despite this enraging flaw, the sound quality and design of the earbuds left most others in the dust.

Fast forward to this month. I just bought this model, and was excited by the prospect of the chord plugging into the earbuds, avoiding chord wear and tear. Then the left side goes dead during the 1st test run.

I'm going for a replacement opposed to refund in the hope that this was a lemon. But if anyone has recommendations for reasonably priced earbuds with good sound, nice fit, and DURABILITY, please comment on this rating. I'm open to suggestions if the replacement earbuds crap out on me."

I don't know if it's just me, but the ear foam heads destroy the sound quality, don't stay in, and are near impossible to take off. The rubber heads have slightly better sound, but will not stay in for a second because of the insane weight of these headphones. The part that should wrap around your ear does not bend enough and is too stiff to use. My cousin also bought these and is having many of the issues I'm having. What gives?"

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are deaf, these are the headphones for you. Look cool, terrible sound. Please be aware that these headphones functioned properly however I am completely dissatisfied with the quality of sound produced by them. They fit well, the foam ear buds are great, but between all genres of music I listen to they sound like trash. House, punk rock, classical, opera, rap, I have tried everything I generally listen to and was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of all of them. The worst was when a Mos Def track came on that I usually enjoy. I was so put off by the attempt of the speaker to get low enough bass I had to unplug the headphones and listen to the song on my phones speaker. Walgreen's has a set of $14.00 headphones that out-perform the E215s. I am not pissed about trying these headphones, I am more pissed about the 5 bucks I am spending to return them. They were not worth $5 for a 1 day trial. In fact, if there were a store I could buy them for $5 right now? I would probably still go for the $14.00 Walgreen's specials. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using the smallest plug and it still seems too big. This hanging over your ears is a joke. Can't be done. Wires are too long, so it's hard to get a good seal to block out other sounds."

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I mainly use earphones at work and in bed before I go to sleep. It's the latter scenario where the problem is. Getting these things in your ear in the dark is a chore. I'm coming from Apple EarPods so anything sounds good to me. I plan on going with either AirPods or Beats X once they drop. That should hopefully solve my nighttime issue.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these earbuds believing that they were genuine Shure Products but recently discovered that they are knock offs or counterfeit products. I sent these into Shure Repair facility to have them fixed and they sent them back because of counterfeit problems. This issue pertains to fraudulent business from the seller. I spent over $100 on this item and am now noticing degradation and deterioration in the left side earphone. It disconnects and stops working. the cables have also started turning blue and are falling apart. I would not recommend buying this product unless it was from the Shure Manufacturer themselves.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot of positive reviews on this product and saw that even if the cord broke it could be replaced and thought this would actually be a good headphone. Sadly it is not. The sound is very tinny and cheap. Yes they aren't the most expensive headphones, but these sound cheaper than pairs that are $20. I ended up getting a plantronic wireless pair for less money and they sound much much better. Don't bother with these, keep shopping."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The design of the replaceable cords causes the sound to cut in and out when you turn your head. Why do $100 earbuds have this problem? I ended up returning them because it was so annoying.

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I was looking for something different. The design of these headphones gave me a bad headache all the time. The headphones are designed to go into your ear canal for better sound. I started to get used to them would still get mild headaches after listening to them for a long time, like during workouts. Great sounding headphones but if you got sensitive ears, which I guess I do, get something else. These headphones also do not stay in your ear during long workouts where you sweat a lot. Good luck finding some that don't, but for 100 dollars I at least don't want headaches. Five stars for sound, Two stars for comfort only........"

Well, after using these for about 10 hours I was having the sound cut out while I walked or turn my head in a certain way. I did some research on the issue and, according to a post at head_fi.org this is a common problem with these headphones, or those that use these same detachable cables. I'm returning these. So disappointed and will not be buying another pair of Shure earphones."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What a waste of money. For $100 the sound is lame. The design is awful as they don't fit in a normal ear and should have came with a shoe horn to cram them in your ear. Once in your ear the sound is muffled by the cheap cushions put on the end. In the continuation of poor design. The plug into my iPhone is too wide to get past the bumper. I had another set of Shure headphone that needed to be replaced because of faulty wiring. Poorly designed and contructed products. NEVER AGAIN!

Buy the JBuds J3M Micro Atomic In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Mic (Jet Black) . At $25 these exceeded all my expectations and have a microphone to boot."

Never traveled with them, rolled the cords, etc. Always had them hanging in place for weekly use at church. One side shorted out within six months, the second side shorted out yesterday. When I pay $100 for a set of headphones, use them infrequently, and take extra care with them, I expect them to last longer than 6-9 months. Very disappointed in the durability of this product."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for about 3 months now and I am not impressed. While they do stay in my ears when I run, I've recently noticed that they are starting to loose sound. Both ear buds constantly going on and off while I run. I have checked my audio jack with other head phones and they works fine. If you have a $100 to spend on head phones, buy something else, just not these. They are not worth the expensive price."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"not easy to use it , needs to get the hang of it. but its really good at isolating outside noise . eg: metro ride , bus ride.) but that can be dangerous when you drive as u dont hear no s*** at all."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY THESE IN EAR MONITORS

I am a young drummer and very short on money. I saved up along time for these because I play in a band. The day I got these they worked amazing. 2 weeks after one fell on the ground and broke. It cost me 50$ for a new left side. Recently the right side stopped working. It would cost me 50$ more to replace them. I had might as well buy a new pair. I will never be purchasing anything from this brand any more for as long as I live. Nothing but trouble."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of Shure SE 425s that broke. While waiting to get them fixed, I need a backup set of IEMs. I saw these 215s and since I love my 425s, I figured these couldn't be too bad and at 99 dollars, seemed worth my time.

Definitely a good purchase. Like the 425s, the cord for these is detachable, which is great because usually I destroy cables pretty quick by snagging them on something or just bending the wires inside too much from use.

The sound is great. Now, I am not a full-bore audiophile. I don't listen to only lossless tracks directly made from the master recordings of artists. But I do listen to a LOT of music and like my music enough to know that ipod earbuds are awful and cause you to lose so much texture of music. The 215s help ensure that does not happen. While they are not as natural-sounding as the 425s, the quality is still great. Sometimes the bass may be a bit heavier than it should be but it definitely not anywhere close to too heavy and, at the price point, quite good.

If you want a decent IEM without breaking the bank and don't care about absolute ""perfect"" sound translation, these are a very good choice.

Tip: The foam tips that come with these make my ears hurt. And the silicone tips never seal right. I know this is not an issue for everyone, but if it is for you, I recommend getting some custom tips made. There are numerous sites you can find online that will make these using either a home impression kit or one make by an audiologist. I have a set for my 425s and they are super comfortable and create a great seal for excellent sound."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned two previous models of Shure earphones, all of which were similar in desigh to these. However, I always manage to leave them on a plane or at a hotel thanks to heavy busines travel and my general forgetfullness. The sound is always excellent and I prefer this type to other (electronically) noise cancelling designs. After a year of use, these are my least favorite. No real complaints on the sound (and after all that's what's most important) but I found the wire used on the SE215s too inflexible. Despite the articulating design, it is difficult to determine which is the left or right and the cable is not flexible enough to comforatably wear with wire-behind-the-ear which is my preference. The plastic around the connector is too large for most iPhones if you are using a protective phone case. Shure no longer includes ear buds made with the foam material I liked (though it may be available for order). As with all of the Shure earbuds I've owned, correct positioning in the ear is critical so I would have liked more choices included. However, these picky complaints aside, I still think these guys make the best sounding earbuds out there - well worth the additional cost (if you can avoid losing them)."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not make them stay seated in my ears. I tried all of the default ear pieces in every possible position and even tried the 3-vane shooting-style ear-canal plugs for them and even those would not work properly (came out after a few minutes and were painful on the ear canals). Maybe I just have incompatible ear structure for these to work. They sounded OK, not great. I was disappointed in the bass response."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't have enough great things to say about these little things. All in all, I have tried ME Electronics dual driver earbuds, and the SE 215's beat them. I tried the Sennheiser HD 598, and SE 215s beat those too! And by clear margins, I had my roommates try and test the headphones with me too, just to get a more sound opinion, and not sound like I was crazy. For a little under a hundred dollars, you can transform your sound experience with these little IEMs. They pack a serious PUNCH. If you haven't tried them yet, you are really missing out.

The sound isolation and the way it cups into your ear is very awesome too. They have a set of tips, you should test each of them to see which one keeps most snug in your ear. Once that is done, it really makes a huge difference. The outside world is completely shut out, and it's just you being transported into a different world. You'll hear sounds you never heard before.

Seriously, amazing."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a wired set of 215s for well over 1yr. They are amazing compared to other headphones that I've owned. Minus the cables continually having issues, mainly due to the harsh conditions that I put them in on a daily basis. The wireless bt-1 has yet to give me any reason to complain! The battery lasts over 1 full day, zero clarity or connectivity issues, and the price us great!

I mainly use these in conjunction with a Samsung Galaxy and an HP Laptop."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely high quality, seal out sound well, and sound that would be suitable to use both in a studio or casual listening. However, after 2 or 3 hours, they do begin to wear on the ears a bit unlike some other higher end headphones. It's not horrible, but it is noticeable."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile but I enjoy listening to music, particularly jazz and classical. These earphones are outstanding, particularly at this price point. I can literally hear and focus on different instruments being played in any given selection. This is head filling sound at its best. It did take me a few days to learn how to wear the earphones properly, but the memory wire makes it easy....it was my learning curve and no fault with the product. The product comes with various sizes of ear tips and they are comfortable and isolate sound very well. The included carrying case is high quality and a nice added feature."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were recommended by a friend as I was looking for earbuds that would reduce noise while I was outside.

This product acts like an earplug with soft, form fitting cushions on the inner ear piece. There were several different sizes included with the package. I had to change from the medium size down to the small size, and removal the ear cushion was a bit difficult as it was very snug on the earbud.

Once I had the earbud seated properly in my ear, then the sound just blossomed! It may take a few tries to find the most comfortable fit for you, but it really does help reduce outside noise and gives you great sound for your podcasts and music.

NOTE: Some persons have recommended the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves for SE model earphones product, since many persons have difficulty using the original inner ear cushion on the earbuds."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got them I the mail today. They arrived SO FAST and loved them from the start. Very well build and very sturdy. I have gone through so many pairs of crappie headphones in my life. Most break after two or three weeks. So I did a lot of research and found these. The price was a bit scary because I was so use to getting new ones that I thought ""wow it's gonna suck if these break"". I took the plunge and bought them after I read tons of reviews all over the net. Well it was worth it! These headphones have no business sounding this good!!!!! The tips that came attracted were a bit hard to get off that came preassembled but I just used my teeth lol. They were to small and memory foam which just feels weird so no harm if I damaged those. I just got the HTC ONE and with the beats these are even better!!! Take the plunge it's worth it!!!!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality:
These are the best sounding headphones that I have ever listened to. The bass is tastefully powerful, punchy, and does not cover up any of the mid-range or high frequency sounds. The overall sound is very detailed AND pleasantly smooth. I hear things that I have never heard in my music before. They are so detailed, that you can often times tell when bands have changed equipment or producers from album to album. Truly amazing! The mid-range sounds come through very well. This helps to especially define vocalists', pianists', and guitarists' sound. The highs are slightly cut and if the headphones had any weak spot in their sound, it might be here. This would be due to the fact that the headphones have only one driver, which is made to respond to the mid-lows the best. If this is crucial to you, I would go to something with more than one driver.

Break-in Period:
Make sure to play medium volume music through these headphones for around 80 hours before expecting proper sound!!! When I pulled the headphones out of the box and took a listen, I was disappointed. They sounded very loose. The highs and mids rang in my ears unpleasantly. This break-in period is crucial to complete before you decide if you like the sound of these headphones!
Build Quality:
These headphones' cables are thick! I'm hoping this translates to many years of use. The only spot that concerns me is the cable's connection to the ear buds. I have not unplugged these yet and plan to keep it that way as some other reviewers have mentioned concerns with this. I also noticed that the shafts that hold the foam or rubber ear tips on are quite thin (I do not know the exact terminology for this piece). Overall, these seem to be very tough headphones and I am fairly confident that they will last for several years or more as long as I continue treat them well.
Ergonomics:
These are the most comfortable headphones that I have worn! They take a little while to get used to at first but once you get used to them, you can wear them for hours on end. I have fallen asleep with theses in and woke up eight hours later without any pain or discomfort to my ears. That day, I continued to use them for a good four hours studying. I still had no discomfort, whatsoever. This is very pleasing for in-ear headphones.

Usability:
There aren't any inline controls or a microphone. This makes usage a bit clumsy because you have to use your phone or audio player controls to do anything. For me, this is not a concern as I bought these headphones for their sound quality.

Overall, these are probably the best sounding, strongest pair of headphones that you can buy for $100!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sound amazing......when they WORK! I owned them for a month until they broke.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so impressed when I bought these. I loved the clarity and the sound of the bass, perfect for most types of music. I couldn't get enough and thought I'd finally found the ones. Then I started noticing a weird electronic buzzing during parts of songs with no sound, such as intros and endings. Shortly afterwards the left side died. It's been about 2 months."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was so expensive that when I opened it I was shocked to see just how terribly it was built. The cord is stiff and unwieldy, yet tangles quite often. The earpiece options are all hard to put into your ear. On top of that, the way this earphone was built makes it so you HAVE to put the stiff unwieldy wires over the top of your ear before you can even put it on. I would recommend this product to absolutely no one because frankly, I can't imagine how anyone would like something so terrible yet so expensive. Its only saving grace is that the sound is at least decent amid all the terrible construction."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few months of using the headphone the music started cutting out in my right and left earphones and after a few weeks it cut out completely in my right earphone unless I physically held the cable near the plug right above the strain relief ribbing and gently moved it into the exact position required to get sound through. I had at this point purchased another cable which had a mic for my phone so I held off addressing the issues with warranty department as I could still listen to my music with the new cable. But then the new cable with the mic started experiencing the same issue. The left earphone would cut out as well, though intermittenly, in conjunction with and sometimes separately from the right earphone. The headphone cable fails right above the plug where the strain relief ribbing is located. When I sent my headphones in with the cable to the warranty deparment to be replaced they would not replace the cable. I go ta message back stating that the cable ""performed as expected"". I plugged the cable into the earphones and had the same exact problem that I sent it back under the warranty period for. This was near th end of my warranty period so I can only assume the following:

1. They knew the warranty would be over soon and did not want to replace it because I would not be able to make another claim as by the time I got it back I would be out of the warranty period.
2. The tester did not read my notes regarding the issue and just put in a standard line on the form.
3. The tester was incompetent.

I purchased these earphones and cables expecting high build quality and a reputable warranty department neither of which has been the case. The cables look like they are high quality but are prone to the same failure as evidenced by the two seperate models of the cable for the same earphones filaing in the same exact manner. This is due to one of the following problems or a combination of them:

1.Poorly designed cables.
2. Poor quality materials.
3. Poor qualitfy control measures.
4. Poor manufacturing practices."

Replacement ear phones are shipped with it but you can't remove the existing ones. Or at least you need a PHD to figure it out.."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these Sure SE215-K headphones on May 20th. Precisely 7 days after the `return window' expired (30 days) these $100 headphones crapped out on me. I was so pleased to finally find a pair of headphones that sounded great and fit snugly. Then, the first time I put them in after returning from a trip abroad, the sound is horrible. The bass has completely dropped out and everything sounds muddy. What a waste. Totally disappointed. I'll be contacting both the seller Rock-Rock and Amazon and Shure if need be to see if they can find it in their hearts to offer a refund for these faulty headphones. I shall return with an update. UPDATE - Amazon customer service did the right thing and sent along a return label."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones in no small part because of the 2 year warranty. I was tired of buying new cheap headphones every 6 months and decided to pay a premium for something that would last me a couple years.
After 4 months of casual usage, the right earbud stopped producing any sound at all, after 6 months the volume from the remaining earbud dropped to maybe 10% of the original. ""That's a bummer"" I thought, ""but this event is exactly why I bought these headphones!"" I sent the headphones in for repair and lo and behold, the warranty does not apply because there was earwax damage! These are in-ear headphones, there will be earwax on every pair of these ever used for a decent amount of time! In fact, this pair of headphones came will a specialty tool specifically for the purpose of cleaning earwax out of the buds (a tool that I used regularly by the way). This appears to me, a way for Shure to refuse to cover under warranty a vast majority of the claims that come in. The cost of repairing + shipping is more than the cost of a new pair of the same headphones!

Do NOT buy these headphones, and if the warranty process on these is any indication - don't buy any Shure headphones."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: GREAT sound, sturdy cables, detachable cable from the ear bud (amazing idea - brilliant)
Cons: cables don't wrap well around ears - or I""m challenged possibly, cables too heave to stay behind ears when working out in any vigorous manner. For example, bend at waist and hang from the hips, buds fall out and cables unwrap. Utterly frustrating!!!!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return it as it did NOT fit good in ears!
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is of a $30 dollars headphones - there's not other way to put it! They are weird shaped and it takes time to getting used to. I am not a big fan of the loops over ears.It's just too much skin contact to feel like you wearing ear-buds.The wires are felt on your neck and this is the way it was designed too..
The wires are too thick and not flexible enough. The product is made in China- I can tell it affects quality.
Sound isolation is good - that's the only positive, but it blocks all sound. Sometimes on a airplane I want to heart when a food cart is behind me but not the constant engine noise.
I am thinking about returning them as they are just not worth the price."

NOTHING. AND, on top, I can hear tiny details, I can hear some sort of a distorted sound in the low-end spectrum, especially on the second unit."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair Of E2C's that were given to me as a demo from Shure years ago and I wore them to the point of the rubber around the cable coming off and the wire breaking inside the cord jacketing causing the sound to go in and out... Having a background in the audio business for many years and very particular about performance i was more then apprehensive about a new pair of IEM's living up to my standards. Im one of these guys who always says ""They don't make them like they used to"" But Wow the SE215's are AWESOME. I opened the zipper case and at first glance I immediately noticed Shure has fixed the part of the cord that touches the top of my ear by using a small piece of flexible tubing around the cord and a piece of metal or like substance to hold the form of the top of the ear. Shure also made the ear bud swivel and detach so the cables can be replaced if at some point I manage to wear these out as well. Next on to the Listening, I have to say the sound out of the box was thin and lackluster. Not what you would expect from Shure. After reading some helpful reviews about IEM's having a break in period I decided to give it a shot and run them over night on my Ipod at medium volume. To my surprise the next morning the sound had completely changed. Wow what a difference. Shure didn't let me down after all. These sound better then the old E2C's. Bottom line for only 99$ buy you a set of SE215's, give them a little break in over night and then experience what your music is supposed to sound like. Thanks Shure I am a customer for Life !!!!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these earbuds last week. I am a weekend musician and planned on using them for both in-ear monitoring on stage, and mp3 player use on airplanes, etc.

After one use in each application, I am very happy with the sound, and VERY unhappy with the fact that every time the cord moves, sound cuts out to one of the earbuds. Where the removable cord attaches to the earbud, there is a design flaw that permits cutting out. Trust me, nothing is more frustrating than being on stage and having to stand still like a robot in order to be able to hear out of both sides of these earbuds.

I returned them immediately, and am very disappointed in Shure. This should not be happening on the scale that it is. Google search SE215 problems and you will see what I mean. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earbuds for my vive and the plan was to use the mic inside the vive.Bad mistake Shure is a good company I never had issue with anything else I bought from them...but,the SE215K feels like I shoved a pair of needle nose pliers in my ear canal and opened them.I was using the smallest thing that they had for it.The sound was mediocre as well.I used them for 45 minutes,testing out different types my music and playing my vive with them.The pain became unbearable and the sound coming from them was lackluster,if I am being nice.The earbuds that come with the vive are even better than these,and they were free(kinda).Also the box is glued together,there is no folded box that is pretty standard with boxed items.They glued the flaps together,you need to be very careful if you are opening this box up and want to keep the box in case of returns."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were great headphones while they lasted. Only worked for about a month and a half and then the left ear bud stopped working. Very disappointed since they were expensive for ear buds.

Second pair arrived broken, the right speaker didn't work whatsoever. Not much more to be said there.

The third pair actually managed to survive a week before they spontaneously started to sound as though both headphones are totally blown. Despite the fact that I rarely ever brought them past half volume.

I am not buying a fourth pair because the returning process is annoying and I don't want to further waste my time. They sound great when they work though."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The shape is bulky and awkward in the ear. The cord is so stiff that the sound of the music was drowned out by the sound of plastic shifting around. The bass was completely missing from the music and the treble was nauseating. WORST EAR BUDS EVER. I'll have to go back and buy a replacement pair of Bose, even though the Bose cord is cheap and flimsy. If only Bose could use a stronger cord, like these but without the stiff part near the earpiece, I'd be in luck...oh well."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish they would have fit and sound half way decent. They made my ears hurt when they stayed on and sounded like a empty beer can, no base at all. The Bose equivalent are just a little bit more expensive but magnitudes better sound and fit, and if you want the ultimate then get the Bose noise canceling. Either of the Bose are magnitudes better than these."

Shure SE215 PHOOEY!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones becauase of the great reviews but it actually sounds no better than the cheap Skullcandy's Ink'd I bought for $15. Comparing the two, I hear just a slight difference in the detail of what I'm hearing than the Skullcandy's (which is in favor of the Shure's). Volume wise it is about the same. I bought a Cowon J3 which has 39 presets and BBE Effect which is supposed to make the music sound better. I know that Cowon players have amazing sound but are horrendous in other areas. Put the setting on Maestro on the Cowon J3 and you will hear incredible sound just out of the Skullcandy's. I used my Android phone with the Shure SE215's, which comparably sounds similar on my Cowon player, but the volume is lower and I heard very little bass. I also bought the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd (which is exactly as it says, it has a microphone) and it has excellent sound and bass. It also sounds even better in my phone than these Shure SE215's. The only real problem with the Skullcandy Ink'd is they don't last more then 2 months and the sound goes. But the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd I've had for 5 months. You can also get a voucher through their website to replace your earphones. Overall, I'd say save your money, get a good media player or phone and stick with the cheap Skullcandy's."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a replacement for my LG Tone earphones and thought I would give the Shures a try. Shure in-ear headphones have always been on my radar but the over the ear design (never been my favorite) and price have always kept me away. I decided to take a chance with the SE215-CL-BT1 and have not been disappointed. I decided to go with the 215s over the 112s because of the detachable (and replaceable) cable. My experience with Bluetooth headphones has shown that when Bluetooth headphone go bad it is usually a short in the cable. The SE215 cures that problem. When/if I have an issue with these I can just replace the cable and keep the driver. Shure got the over-the-ear design of the cables just right . I have tried this same design in headphones from Klipsch and Polk and have found them extremely annoying and uncomfortable. The Shures are so comfortable that I forget that they are over the ear. Battery life is good at roughly 8 hours per charge and charging time of 2 hour is fast with a quick charge of 15 minutes that gets you 2 hours of listening time. Another bonus is they come with both silicone and foam ear tips. For me the silicone are a little more comfortable and much easier to insert. The foam tips take a little more practice but if done correctly you get a much tighter seal and much better sound isolation. The clip for your shirt collar is a nice touch and helps keep them secure because you really don't want to lose a $150 set of earphones.

So is there anything that I don't like? I only have a couple of minor gripes. 1) once in a while they get finicky and touching the earbud or cable causes dropouts. This has always been fixed by disconnecting the cable from the earbud and plugging it back in. Something you have to take them off and do and definitely not something you can do while driving. 2) I really wish the cable was just a bit longer. I like being able to clip them to the back of my shirt and letting the earbud hang over my shoulders down on my chest. However when I do this the control pod falls just behind my right ear. Not a big deal for accessing the controls but the microphone for phone calls is also there and callers complain that I sound like I am in a tunnel somewhere. This is easily fixed by clipping them to the front of my shirt collar and the mic falls just where it needs to. It just doesn't feel as secure because if they come unclipped then they easily fall to the ground. Both gripes are minor and easily over looked based on the next part of this review.

Finally, how do they sound? Oh my god the sound. If you get a good seal on the tips (keep trying different tips until you find your own personal ""sweet spot"" which for me it is the large foam tips) the sound is nothing short of amazing. Bass is tight, deep but not boomy. Highs are crisp and clear. Mids stand out just as they should. These are a very balanced sound. Efficiency is so good that I have found myself listening at volumes almost half of my LGs. Sound quality leaves the LGs in the dust. I have almost stopped using my Bose QC35s because the sound of the Shures are so far superior. The only thing the Bose have on them is the active noise cancellation is better than the Shure's passive noise isolation but the sound quality difference makes this a non-issue except in extremely noisy environments. The sound on the SE215-CL-BT1 will give my AKG 701s (my favorite headphones I have ever owned) a run for their money. Something I never expected out of a set of in-ear headphone.

The final verdict: Buy them. You won't be disappointed."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, but the design sucks."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these a few days ago. I bought them to wear at work to block out some noise from computer equipment. It is a tedious task to figure out how to put these in your ear if you have never used this type of listening device before. Once I got them in they were pretty good. Blocked out a decent amount of noise but very hard to take out to answer the phone and then put back in quickly. I actually have to tug on my ear quite a bit and push them in to get these to fit in my ear canal.

I could see myself using these on a 14 hour plane ride with no problem or a very long walk. Otherwise I would probably just grab a pair of ear buds and be on my way. The foam tips that come with it were okay. It took forever for them to go back to their regular shape after being smushed and one was completely irregular to begin with so I couldn't use that one. I might try them again when I have the patience to wait around for them to expand and fit in my ear canal. It is nice that they offer the different sizes.

I do love the fact that the cords are heavy duty and that the ear pieces swivel so the cord doesn't get tangled up."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds have very good sound quality, but my disappointment with them is the lack of iPhone compatibility. The optional phone cable accessory is way too expensive for a low quality wire. The phone cable isn't designed for ""over the ear"", doesn't have the cable ear reinforcement, and the button assembly looks clunky. The included cable has such a large mini jack connector that it doesn't fit with most phone cases such as the Apple bumper case. There's no excuse for this after 6 years of smartphones. Shure desperately needs to offer these earbuds with the option of a higher quality phone cable instead of the normal cable."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for use with my 535s.

Sound quality is not great, sounds as if I'm listening through a tunnel, really disappointing. There's also no support for the aptX bluetooth profile, so quality takes a huge hit on devices that support aptX. The difference between this and the Sennheiser Momentum BT is significant.

There's lots of interference walking down busy streets, with passing cars causing stutters or complete dropouts.

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were okay until they broke on me after 8 months. The sound started to cut out when I was walking after about 6 months. I contacted Shure. They couldn't fix them and opted to not replace them so they refunded me the money. Can't complain about the refund but for headphones of this quality and price, they should have lasted more than 8 months.

The sound quality was pretty good. They did get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a while (my commute to work is about an hour and a half).

Also, I put these things in first thing in the morning after showering, so (gross) my ear wax got the buds dirty a lot. Now, I am a very hygenic person. I don't clean my ears every day (you're not supposed to) but I definitely do not let wax build up more than the average person and these got gross quick.

So glad I switched to Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones. Well worth the additional $10."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these se215 headphones to replace 6 year old E3 where the phono jack was worn from plugging in so much. Got them in April and use them 8-10 hours a week. The left earphone started cutting out and I would have to jiggle the rotating connection on the earphone. That would work for a minute or two then became more frequent and completely cut out. Now it is dead. Tried cleaning the connection and switching connections left-right right-left still no luck. The pivoting connection is horrible and moving connections are destined for failure. I will stick with a fixed connection next time. They do have more bass than the E3's but the E3's have more robust cables and connectors.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to buy these headphones a week ago. I'm not an audiophile but received some bose in-ear headphones a few years ago as a gift and loved them...until they stopped working due a problem with the cord/wiring, which seems to be a common issue..

I was sold on the sound quality of the Shure headphones and other customers' reviews. So, I picked these up in anticipation of a big overseas trip. Well the headphones showed up and worked great for two days. Then, the left earbud inexplicably stopped working altogether. I had specifically bought these b/c I liked that the cord was detachable from the earbuds - after the cord issue w/my Bose I thought this was a great product feature. Well - that doesn't mean jack if the earbud stops working...after ~4 hours of light use!!!! Not sure if it was a lemon or what...but bottom-line, Shure needs to do a better job w/quality control. Judging from the few other posts on here, I'm not the only one to have them break after a few days of use.

the sound was good while it lasted...I hate shopping in general and there is nothing worse that doing your research, making an educated product purchasing decision, and then feeling like you got screwed due to cheap manufacturing practices..."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"MY OPINION:

Durability of the spliced ends: I get a new pair of earbuds pretty much every year because the wires (where they attach into the earbuds) eventually get worn and break. I'm a 44 year old woman and wear them for running or while on the elliptical (so general wear and tear). Being that I have professionally done the same type of splices that where done on these ""refurbished"" earbuds, I know that these splices cannot withstand (for very long) the movement that they will be subjected to if one uses them when exercising. I would never recommend that splice with a wire that will be moving around very much.

Cost of this refurbishment: I had already spliced my old pair (at home--for free), with a much more reliable splice job (so I guess I'll keep using my old ones until I order NEW ones). I'm curious as to how the seller feels he/she rates to charge $99 for this repair splice, that takes about 5 mins. I really have to question the ethics of that.

Next issue with these earbuds: I have a pair of the old Shure 215's, which I purchased about a year ago, only mine are better because they have a part that can be used with a cell phone. I may have missed that feature in these refurbished ones, but I would expect the newer version to have, at a minimum, the same features--not less.

My last issue is that now I'm being charged to ship them back because I'm not willing to settle for the quality of this product?? And I also paid to ship them to me.. I feel like I got jacked since the earbuds are junk--in my opinion.

By the way, the replacement ends (when you need to change them out), I think I saw somewhere that they cost $40 by themselves. For that amount, you've spent about half the amount of the original cost of the refurbished ones."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had read up on these ear buds as a good alternative to the larger over the ear noise canceling headphones and was very surprised to see them show up at my door a day early, however my joy ended there. Right from the start the box showed signs that it had been glued shut (finger print where super glue had removed just a little box paint), clearly previously opened, but I figured I'd see if it was perhaps just cosmetic damage and that everything else inside would be fine; it was not. The cords had been twisted together, appearing to have kinks, and the different sized cups and cleaning tool was missing. Clearly this product had been returned by someone else and the seller simply sent if off to me without even inspecting the outer box for 'tampering'. For a product that goes INSIDE the body (all-be-it a very small amount) I DO NOT WANT a previously used product that didn't even get inspected. I'm sure the ear buds are great but I'm never going to find out because I'm not interested in any product from a seller who doesn't care enough inspect this 'type' of product before trying to send it off to another customer. For the price I was expecting a 'new' product, not one that had already been inside someone else's ears."

The cable produces medorcre sound quality with the 535’s. I have exprenced better buletooth sound quality from first generation Beats studios. Additionally, there is a female voice that prompts for any action the device takes, like connecting or low battery. Extremely annoying, considering music will already be playing before I am prompted that the headphones are connected or you’ll be notified 7 times to a low battery before it’s completely exalted."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a longtime SE215 wired user and was looking forward to the wireless experience. This is my second pair of SE215 wireless earphones - the cable on the first was literally damaged while removing from the packaging (which Amazon immediately replaced). This pair was great until I ran with them in the rain (day three). I knew that there was a problem when the volume started to involuntarily lower to zero, and the buttons on the remote would not do anything. Once inside, I disconnected the SE215s from my iPhone via the iPhone's Bluetooth menu (SE215 remote buttons continued to be non-functioning). Ten or so minutes later, I attempted to power off/on the SE215s via the power button, only to have the LED go solid red and nothing else functional (cannot connect to iPhone, power off/on, etc.). I called Shure Technical Support and was told that I should not charge the SE215s and wait until the battery dies, then let sit for ""a couple of days"" and see if they work. They also recommended that I place them in a bag of rice. Unacceptable for a product that I will use for workouts; going back to Amazon permanently today."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't waste your money on this product. I have used Shure earbuds for a few years and absolutely love them. Except for this pair for two reasons.

First - the earabuds are very difficult to adjust to the ear canal. It took a great deal of twisting and turning each bud for each ear. It never felt secure in the canal or the ear itself. The fit is extremely poor.

Second - the quality of sound was awful, very tinny, male voices nearly sounded like females. I have many movies on my iPod and couldn't get the sound to be anything like the sound tracks.

This Shure product is a great disappointment. It is going in my drawer to never be seen again."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible sound for its price class and not comfortable to wear. I played with them for 30m and threw them in the trash can.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound. I've had several versions of these headphones over many years, having bought each subsequent model as they've updated the design. This one delivers as expected in many ways - most notably the audio, which is probably the most important aspect. There are a couple of disappointments, however.

One flaw is that they are just not very easy to get around the ears and into the ear canal. They have a stiff sheath along the few inches of cord nearest to the buds which does not mold easily to the shape of the ear. I understand what they were trying to do - presumably they wanted to give that section some sturdiness so that the cord would mold nicely and stay in place - but the execution produced the opposite of the desired effect, actually making it harder to get the cord to hook around the ear and stay put.

Moreover, because of the substantial plastic casing around the electronics, the buds don't fit in my ears very squarely, and the positioning is easily disrupted by any contact. Any pressure on the bulky outside of the buds - such as from a pillow or even a headband when it's cold - can cause the fit to be distorted, the foam to collapse, and the sound to be muted. Not ideal.

I'll continue to use these headphones and I'm not in a hurry to replace them, but they are not as well-designed as previous Shure models, and when it is time to buy again, I will research other options."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not an audiophile but I know cheap earbuds. I've tried many - Sony, Phillips,MEE,Etymotic, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Klipsch and a host of others. For just sit-down listening it was clearly the Klipsch s4. But they are not built to stay and not that great at sound block. For my more active phases the MEE(or something) had the best earpiece that was flexible to mold around your ear and the bud itself was not bad. It stayed there, blocked the ambient sound but didn't sound great. Hey, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. But then came pre-Black Friday (once known as Thanksgiving) and Amazon drops the price of these puppies and Wallah! I snap them up. These sound a little better to me than the Klipsch, have the same ear bending wire to mold it around the ear as the MEE and the unique way it fits and the cushion just fill the entire ear canal comfortably with the best earbud sound. That;s 3 out of 3 if you don't count the price. Get these if you're limited to $100 or less or wait until next Black Friday"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just could not get them to stay in. I guess I am getting old. Left the old shure earbuds at home when we went on a trip. Simple, 90 degree turn, put it in your ear and it stays. So I ordered on amazon and shipped ahead. They arrived before we got there and we continued on ready to use them. The instructions are very unclear how they go in. Kind of shows one way, but they are not as simple as the 90 degree kind. Since then I have found the instructions online as how to fit them in the ear.
When held in, they sounded fine.
I purchased this model because they have the two types of ear forms: the foam and a rubber one. They come with 3 sizes that fit most any ear."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received the headphones yesterday and tried them out immediately. Well first I got to say these headphones sound great! Awesome sound and deep lows, which should be expected out of a set of good quality monitoring headphones that cost this much. My only complaints are that the earphones don't fit exactly in the inner ear unless you have them just right. So you have to mess with them a little until you find the right position for your ear. If you don't have them positioned correctly, the sound is awful and you won't be impressed at all. The other complaint is the price. There are so many monitoring style earphones out on the market today that are much lower but I'd imagine the sound quality would not be as great. Well, just for the record, this is not exactly true. I also bought a set of MEElectronics M6-BK for around $20. These headphones sound almost as good, for just a 1/4 of the price. If I would have known this before, I might not have purchased the Shure earphones. Although I'm a little remorseful for purchasing these Shure headphones at this price, I'm not dis-satisfied about the sound and quality. The biggest difference you'll see upfront between the Shure and other earphones (in the lower price range) is the quality of the build. The Shure has heavy duty wiring (lined with Kevlar) and gold connections, where the $20 headphones do not. So in short, the Shure earphones are a good buy if money is not a major deal breaker."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 7/12/13: I am changing my initial review after about a month of usage. A couple of things happened to change my mind.

First, I realized I hadn't been wearing the earpieces correctly. After inserting the units, I needed to tug on my earlobe and push them flush against my ear for a snug fit. Previously, the piece that rests on the ear kept popping out. I guess doing this directed the sound waves differently in my ear and it greatly improved the sound.

The other thing that changed my mind is that I did a side by side comparison with new Sony MDR-EX33LP I ordered after my initial review. The Shures sound is much richer and balanced and I'm able to clearly hear more subtle components in the music -- even at low volumes -- compared to the Sony, which has improved my listening experience.

So I'm glad I stuck with these. I guess the most important thing to keep in mind is to make sure you're inserting these 100% correctly in your ear for the best sound.

-------------------------
I really tried to like these ear buds but was just not able to do so. I am a big fan of the Sony MDR-EX33LP/SLV EX but one side always stopped working after a few months so I was looking for something sturdier. I chose the Shure headphones based on the reviews they got for durability and sound.

While they certainly seem durable, the sound is disappointing. The best way to describe the sound is flat, lifeless. I tried burning them in as recommended and also different EQ settings but no difference. The Sony's sound, on the other hand, is great -- bright, clear and punchy.

The one thing I do like about the Sure headphones is that they're very comfortable and do provide a good deal of sound insulation. I'm going back to the Sony model and will keep these for wearing when flying."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Sound great. The only problem that I have is when trying to put my helmet on (motorcycle helmet) they are easily pulled outta my ears. They are a little difficult to get the hang on putting them in your ears, but after a couple tries it gets much easier. Would be nice if they had some picture instructions in the box with them. Other than that they have great sound, better than the last two pairs of bose headphones that I had. They give you tons of extra cable, which gets caught on things if you run with or are around stuff and moving. I'd suggest using a zip tie to wrap up a small portion of the wire while in use."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, the comfort level isn't the greatest. Just so everyone understands, these are not regular ear buds. They are in-ear monitors. The larger plastic piece fits inside the ""concha"" area of the ear (look it up.. I had to as well). This is where prolonged use may become uncomfortable if that section doesn't fit well. Otherwise, the construction on these are great and once again, the sound quality is great."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement to my Sony XBA-1iP, which were rather lacking on the lows especially. Not only do the Shure SE215s have beautiful sounding lows, the sound coming out of these is beautiful in general; very well balanced. I found the factory default covers to fit my ears just fine, but there are plenty of alternatively sized covers that come included in a resealable bag that can be left in the carrying case, which is also included. However, for about the first week of use, the fit for these did take getting used to as I've never owned a pair of earphones before in which the cord goes behind the ear. After getting used to it, the fit on these are suburb - you can easily use them for hours on end. In regards to noise isolation, the manual these come with says ""Wear them like you would a pair of earplugs"" and boy, do they make for great earplugs. That said, the noise isolation on these is so great - even at a low volume - that it can pose a hazard if you plan on going for a walk/jog with these on.

Plain and simple, these sound great, they fit great, and they're great for listening over extended periods of time."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now owned 5 pairs of quality, sub-$100 ear buds and this is my favorite pair yet. I first bought a pair of Etymotic ER6i's which had a nice, clean sound although they were a bit thin on the bass. Thin wiring finally gave out on those and one of the ear buds quit working. I also had a pair of Klipsch Custom 2's, a dual driver IEM that had a rich, warm sound that I really liked. A trip through the washing machine damaged the cables which gave out completely soon after. Since then, I bought another pair of Etymotics (MC-5) and a pair of Klipsch S4's. I've been pretty happy with both of those, although both pairs have their weaknesses that have bothered me a bit and I kept thinking I could find something better around the same price point.

After reading positive reviews of Shure's IEM's for years I finally decided to get a pair. I bought these SE215's and I can't praise them enough. First, the build quality on these is unbelievable. The cables are much thicker and heavier than any other pair of ear buds I've owned. Everything about the fit and finish on these feels solid and gives the impression they will stand up to some abuse. Like the Klipsch Custom 2's I owned, where the cables come out of the ear buds, they have a small section of memory wire that you loop over the top of your ear rather than just dangling down like most ear buds. This takes a bit of getting used to (mostly when putting them on), but works well once you get the hang of it.

They sound great. The bass is deep and solid, but doesn't overwhelm the midtones and highs which are crisp and clean. Compared to my Etymotic MC5's the bottom end is much more robust and satisfying. And the mids and highs are cleaner than with my Klipsch S4s. I have a difficult time believing you'll find anything that sounds better without going into the $150-200 price range.

I'm a runner, and I always take in to account how a pair of head phones will perform when running. The Etymotics and the Klipsch pair are both pretty solid for running with only a couple of issues. They both can produce a lot of cable noise which tends to cause you to increase the volume to drown it out. And they both have a tendency to start working their way loose in your ears as you begin to get sweaty. Both of these issues appear to be solved with these Shures. The heavy duty cables and the way you loop them over your ears solves the cable noise problem.

The only complaint I've got is that I wasn't really happy with the included sleeves. I got a good seal with the silicone sleeves, but they have a small ridge going around them (from the molding process I assume) that irritates my ears when I put them in. And I had a difficult time getting a good seal with the memory foam sleeves. I suspect if I experiment with them a bit more I may like them, but they also seem pretty fiddley...something you can't just pop in and out. I ended up using a pair of dual-flange sleeves that came with my Klipsch Custom 2's. They fit on the ear buds easily and are easy to quickly get on and make a good seal.

I've very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality, excellent sounding pair of IEM's for under $100."

Left side snapped together with a definite click and took some effort to plug/unplug. Pretty disappointing as I had read tons of reviews about how great these were.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these are great except for the highs as bass overpowers. Left earphone stopped working within a week :( had to return.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As background on me, I've heard or owned almost all the $1,000+ universal IEMs, JH Audio, Shure, Noble, ie800 etc. But I was always curious about the SE215 because of its good reputation, and at $90 I thought, what the heck it's worth a gamble.

Observations below:

1. The bass issue: As many have noted, these put out slightly too much bass if you use the black foam tip and get a good seal. But it's just a little too much. What I mean is that it's not an insufferable amount of bass; just annoying; like, ""that drum could have been toned down just a bit."" The good news is that if you switch from the foam tips to the silicon rubber tips, the bass goes down and it's almost perfect. Also, a little too much bass is both a negative and a positive -- although excess bass takes away from other frequencies, sometimes bass sounds good; if you want to hear the drums in your favorite tracks, this will deliver. Update: After breaking it in, the bass toned down.

2. The mids and highs are underrated. I saw the reviews about the SE215's poor highs, and I was expecting an AM-radio-style muddy mess. But this can deliver the highs. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bright headphone; it's a warm headphone. But its treble is not deficient (and remember that a warm sound signature is safest with iems, because highs are the frequencies that can damage hearing). [EDIT: Update after a month of use: they've gotten brighter and brighter over time and now I would characterize them as neutral or even bright. So make sure you let them break in.]

3. The imaging / sense of 3-D spaciousness is good. That's to be expected from basic headphone science; a pair of dynamic drivers will generally image better than multiple balanced armature drivers (partly the nature of a dynamic driver, and partly because it's hard to perfectly time the sound from multiple drivers.)

4. These will sound noticeably better with a proper dac/amp, as opposed to just plugging them into your phone.

So I know what you're thinking -- how does it compare to the $1,000 IEMs? Basically, the expensive IEMs are just a little better at some elements. Some have better vocals, some better highs, some better detail, some better imaging and so on, and some are worse on some of these dimensions. But this $90 thing is in the ballpark, which was surprising. The best analogy I can give is with cars. You have Ferraris, Bentleys and so on (call these the top of the line IEMs) , and you have garbage like the Smart Car or a Vespa (call these the Apple earbud). The SE215 would be like a BMW 3 or 5 series. To put it another way, if I got stuck somewhere without all of my expensive IEMs, and all I had were these, I would be fine."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I hate these earbuds. They don't stay in my ear at all. Even the $20 iPhone ear buds are better.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought the mic is included. I need to use it for the phone calls. I have to order another cable with a mic, disappointed. Have not used it yet. so no comments on the quality."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes some incredible IEMs, but it seems like they aren't so good at the cables. Which is why I'm glad they're removable. I picked these up from the airport after losing a competitor's set in a hotel room and they hardly work. It's nice there's a voice there to remind me that i have more than 2 hours of battery, but out of nowhere it loses a connection and then refuses to turn back on until I plug them in and unplug them again.

The cables themselves aren't balanced correctly, the button/mic thing sits below your right ear, and the battery kinda lays across your chest or behind your head, depending on how you wear them. The cables are really long from ear to ear so you end up with a clunky, chunky set of cables in what should be elegant and small, especially for the price.

I'd wait for the next version."

4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As stage monitors, these earphones more than do the trick. The ""in ear"" experience is like no monitoring experience you've ever had. It literally changes the way you play and sing. The intricacies of the music come to life inside the Shure 215 earphones. The primary reasons that I am satisfied with these headphones could be summed up by simply saying the following: They should fit pretty much every single ear with ease. Not only will they fit, they will be comfortable. Not only will they be comfortable, they will immerse you in a world that is 37db quieter than what you're used to. I'm not going to lie, it's a bit of an adjustment, but an adjustment well worth the making. They will be stable on your head. While the provided fit kit helps the earphones stay firmly planted in your ear canal, the cabling will help stabilize the earphones even further. The ""moldable"" cable around your ears greatly cuts down extraneous movement and the additional piece that pulls the cabling tight to the base of your skull greatly reduces the pull from the cable hanging down your back. All of this is great bu the key here is the sound. You will hear nuance in your performance that you've never heard before. These earphones have pristine highs and mids that greatly help with vocal and instrumental performance. While it is a little lacking on the bass end for my taste, any good sound system will have some outboard gear which should include an EQ for the stage monitors so the lack of punch in the bass shouldn't be an issue for the live performer as you will be able to correct this in the EQ. These earphones come with a number of ""fit"" options that make finding the right ""fit"" for your ear a snap. The included fit kit comes with a good array of foam and flex materials that made fitting my own ears very quick. The cables that go to each earpiece are detachable. Not sure why I would want this feature but something like this would come in handy for maintenance or replacement. The actual cable has a piece that allows you to draw the earpiece cables tight against the back of your skull. This provides nice stability. The sound isolation is excellent. The cable is not exceptionally long. I'm about six foot and the actual 1/8 inch adapter for the cable hangs just below my waist. So if you're very tall you might consider that this cable might not reach waist level. For most, however, I wouldn't think this feature would be a hindrance...especially if you don't plan to use these earphones in a live music setting (stage monitoring for example) There is FORMABLE cable around the earpieces so that you can mold the wire to the contour of your ear. This greatly improves the stability. There is no kind of EQ control within the headphones so depending on what you're listening to, and what you're listening to it on, you might notice that these earphones are a little treble heavy. But of course, that is what you should expect in something with a single microdriver. So, for a fair price, you actually get an array of nice features that make this product well worth the investment. I think the construction, the fit, and the sound of these earphones are quite good. My primary use for these is in live music settings. These earphones are my stage monitors. Thus far, they have proven to be both durable and reliable. So like I said...good construction. The fit is such that I can wear these earphones for hours on end with little to no discomfort. So, like I said...high quality fit. The sound is the only thing that is a little lacking but I blame the single microdriver moreso than anything else. If you're using these earphones in live settings I would most definitely recommend the use of an EQ to improve the articulation of the bass frequencies. But, having said that, I am in no way disappointed with the overall sound of these earphones. I quite enjoy watching movies with these earphones. By nature of their design these earphones provide a unique audio experience in modern films where the stereo sound field is being highly manipulated. So anyway, good and diverse overall..."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have high expectations of Shure but the SE215 didn't wow me in any way. Having said that, it's the first earphone I've owned to get the right mix of all the characteristics I look for in an earphone. I'm more demanding of an earphone than a stay-at-home headphone, it has to do more than stay on my head and sound good. Things like durability, isolation and microphonics, among other things, are important and Shure gets that.

Comfort/Design:
They were not as comfortable as they looked. It's a personal thing but they literally rubbed me the wrong way, not so much as to be problematic but it dismissed the notion I had of any IEM of this shape being instantly comfortable, something I will think about for future purchases. Still, they were adequate and I would pick an over-the-ear style cable any day. Due to the cable route and the cable itself, microphonic noise is as low as I could reasonably expect. I was not able to comfortably listen to them while lying on my side but your experience may differ.

The Shure ""Olive"" foam tips are comfortable and I found them easy to fit. I've never had the issues some people have with memory foam eartips or earplugs but I still found them easier to handle than most. Contrary to popular opinion, they can be cleaned without entirely losing their performance.

The cable jack is solid and properly strain relieved but is bigger than with most other earphones. So much so that most iPhone cases (the ones that cover around the jack) that aren't of the super-thin variety will not allow you to plug your earphones in.

Isolation:
It will be hard to beat any Shure for isolation at this price point. I can't fault it at all, any more might be dangerous.

Durability:
With the rave reviews at the time, I had high expectations and my initial impressions were good. It was the best feeling cable of any IEM I've used and it looked rugged enough. It resisted tangling or kinking and felt like it would outlast my other IEMs by far but I was wrong about that last one. My first cable broke at just over half a year and the 2nd cable lasted about that long as well. Both were swiftly repaired under warranty and my final cable lasted an impressive 2 years although at that point, the memory wire had punctured a whole in the heat shrink that at the part of the cable that wraps around your ear.

The cable is still better than most of what I've used at this price point but it wasn't all I was lead to believe it would be. It's great that you can replace them yourself but when the cable costs 40% (it used to be more) of the earphone's original price, it's no longer a big feature. I can imagine SE535 owners shelling out the 40 dollars but I don't feel it's worth it for this one.

I didn't have many issues with the earpieces themselves although I did crack the housing when removing a stubborn eartip with force. It did not affect the sound.

Sound:
Shures generally have an inoffensive sound and the SE215 follows that trend. It is a bassy headphone but the bass is controlled better than many other popular offerings at this price point, the Beats come to mind. The bass ends up being the predominant aspect of the SE215's sound but it stops just short of overwhelming the midrange. The treble is rolled-off which contributes to the inoffensive sound but also kills off any airiness the SE215 might have had. It does tend to have a ""boxed-in"" sound which isn't poor but not impressive. It's not the most energetic earphone but it has enough to keep up with most forms of music. Detail is not the best on this Shure but it has a smooth, warm presentation that I generally find to be quite pleasing.

It won't knock you over with its technical ability but the overall presentation is good. If you can enjoy your music for $99 then you should have no problem doing it with the SE215.

You can easily find better sounding earphones at this price but you will find it a lot harder to find something that can top the SE215 in all the aforementioned areas. Sonically, it's not a hugely impressive earphone but Shure has created a product that does its job very well. The SE215 is probably the best earphone I've used on the go and for this price, you can't go wrong."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using a cheap no-brand MMCX BT cable I was pleased to see Shure finally produce an official BT solution — and for it to be retroactively compatible with my SE535s. Albeit for a lot more than I paid for the no-brand variation.

Overall, I’m quite pleased. As others have noted the cable design feels less than ideal and I generally end up wearing it in front of my neck. The battery often makes it uncomfortable to have the wire dangling behind.

The biggest issue I have with the unit is the microphone. This unit is really sub par for phone calls, Siri, etc. This is really disappointing given Shure’s expertise in microphones and the price being paid. I have had a number of Bluetooth headphones over the years and the microphone on these is the worst. I have to switch to the phone to be heard. It’s too bad.

If you don’t care about phone calls or voice dictation, etc, these are a good option. Otherwise, enjoy the music, and hope you don’t receive too many calls!

UPDATE: The call quality issue has worsened. I had to buy a separate dedicated bluetooth headset to handle calls, unfortunately, since I received too many complaints about inaudibility.

I am thinking my cable may be defective. While the unit has a two-year warranty, unfortunately it will take a couple of weeks to process a repair (there's no cross-shipping) and I will have to pay for shipping. Not the friendliest policy, considering I paid $100 for a simple cable and some pretty commonplace electronics these days. On top of what I paid for the original SE535s as well... Oh well."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds are comparable to two tin cans and some string. The stock ear buds that are provided with the iPhone are better. I would not recommend these to my worst enemy. The sound consistently fades in and out.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's the deal: shure earphones short out where the cable connects to the speaker piece. 4th pair of shures and absolutely my last (2 others have done the same thing). Thought new detachable cable design would make a difference. It doesn't. Too bad because sound quality is great for the price. No longer will I exercise my insanity with this brand. I've used these new se215s 4 times and the left earphone is already cutting out. Same story. I buy earphones to USE them, not to screw with filling out repair reports and shipping services. I GUARANTEE that if you buy these one or both sides WILL short out. Consider yourself warned and avoid these unless you like buying things that don't work. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the first set of Shure earbuds I've owned. I had a set of the E2c's, which were fantastic. After about 5 years of hard labor, they finally gave up the ghost, and suffered the usual death by cable rot to which that series of buds were so prone. So I took to the search for a replacement, and these were my criteria...

1. They must be in-ear style buds, with the option to switch the sleeves (The piece that goes in the ear). Also, they must include those swappable pieces.

2. They must have a good warranty of at least 2 years.

3. They must not cost more than ~100 USD.

4. They must sound great.

(These are in no order of preference, and all considered equal)

So with that in mind, I also need to mention that I was partial to Shure. Mostly, because the E2c's were my first real good set of earphones, and broke down all my stigmas as to ""Why would anyone pay so much for headphones?"" So here is my review.

The Sleeves - There are 2 different types of sleeves bundled with this set; one a flexible rubber, the other a re-expandable foam. Each has three separate sizes, to help you find a good fit. I tried both. The foam sleeves feel nice, so long as you insert them like earplugs. They expand nicely to your ear canal. They offer fantastic sound isolation, and stay inside. The rubber sleeves are comfortable, but they are constantly being pulled out of your ears by the very stiff cord. I will try them again once I get the cord broken in a bit more, but for now, I'm going with the foam sleeves.

The Warranty - 2 years, not bad, but my E2c's had 3. From what I hear, the cable rot issue is still going on, but I will expand on that in a minute.

The cost - If you can get them for 100 USD, then do it. I think they are normally 2X that price.

The Sound - At first, I was a bit worried. I was hearing some odd pops in the earphones. Pops that I shouldn't be hearing from a headset this expensive. But, that turned out to be from the player I had them plugged into. I tried a different source, and no pops. They are at least as good as my E2c's were when I first got them. There is some talk about the lows and highs and all that, and I don't know about all that. I know that I was getting some weird looks at the restaurant I was at when I was headbanging and booth-breaking (sit down dancing at my table) to the music. I listen to a lot of rock, electronica, and trip hop, and it all sounds great.

Other Stuff - I mentioned the cables, and for good reason. Shure has a history of cable rot; the insulation on the wires literally rots off, and results in dead headphones. To combat that, they have added 2 features. One, an additional layer of insulation around where the wire goes over the ear (The most common place of rot). This likely extends the life of the cable, which makes it even thicker than it already is, which makes it VERY stiff. This stiffness leads to the cable not staying in place, and needing some serious breaking in, which in turn could lead to breaking the wire. So be careful, and be patient. If you use the foam sleeves, then it isn't that big of a problem.
The other thing is that they made the cable able to be detached from the earpiece, which means you can replace it if it goes bad. This is nice, except that, it's proprietary. It is unlikely that Shure will still have these cables in a few years available for purchase or otherwise. So while it's a nice feature, you likely won't be able to use it for anything other than changing the color of your wires. (It would likely be a good idea to order a spare once these earbuds are discontinued).

I also want to comment on the case that comes with the set. At first, I didn't like it, becasue my previous Shure's had such a nice case. It was solid, with an insert in the middle that you could wrap the cords around and place the drivers inside of. This case is soft, and has no way to manage the cables or drivers other than jsut stuffing them inside, which is what I didn't like at first. But over time, I have grown to like how much more compact it is. The soft case fits easily into my pocket, and keeps everything pretty contained (the last case bulged a lot). And I've never once had an issue where I felt they were compromised as a result. So I would say the soft case works quite well, and has a sharp looking Shure logo on it.

So that's my experience with the 215's. I recommend them to anyone that knows how important a good set of headphones are, but doesn't have a lot of money to dedicate to them."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually purchased these off Shure's website with a 3 year warranty 4 years ago. I've had these since then and have not had a single problem out of them! I originally bought them for the purpose of using them as studio monitors on stage at church (I drum in a youth band).

When you purchase them, you're buying the headphones, the cord that they detach from, the small case to carry them, a small cleaning tool that is extremely useful for cleaning debris out of them like wax and whatnot, and 6 different buds to go in your ears; 3 sizes of foam for full and clear bass and long term comfort, and 3 sizes of a rubber-like material for athletic activites (I discovered they were water resistant when I ran a half marathon with them and many 5ks and I sweat ALOT). Even though the foam tips sound amazing and are more comfortable, they are tougher to clean and the rubber tips still sound fantastic. I actually use the rubber tips mostly because they're so much easier to manage.

The cord in my opinion is the perfect length. It's just long enough to where you can stand upright with your device in your pocket and have a fair amount of slack but not enough where it can be cumbersome. THE CABLE FOR THE HEADPHONES IS ALSO HIGHLY TANGLE-FREE. I remember about a month ago I went to work with my headphones wrapped in a circle in my pocket. I pulled them out when I get to work and my friend says, ""you did not just pull those headphones out of your pocket untangled.."" I laughed and held them from the headphone jack and let the rest fall and they unraveled perfectly before I proceeded to roll them back up.

The case is durable and very useful; it has a small D ring clip to attach it to whatever.

As far as maintenance goes, there is a small booklet that comes with the headphones that is very straightforward with everything from cleaning to swapping earbuds.

I'm reviewing these just now because after 4 years of having these and literally not a single problem, I believe I should share the word about how phenomenal these babies are. I'm buying a pair of white ones for my younger sister cause she is always taking mine.

Hope this was helpful!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not to be confused with the shute ear buds (which are fantastic). I have owned 2 of the shure Bluetooth components- product I am reviewing. I have broom using these for 6 months and have had the 425 model ear buds for 2 years.

Pros: great Bluetooth range and battery life
Con: the cable connecting to the ear buds is horribly designed. HORRIBLE DESIGN:

With 6 hours of battery life, the battery is sizable and, even with the garment clip, it is too big/ heavy. Further, it’s position on the cable doesn’t allow the small “wire to wire clip” to center when trying to take up slack. Next, factor in the volume/ controls on the right side of the cable... I’m currently on the stair machine and it is hitting my cheek, with each step.

The first product I had would short out when I would move. Exchanged it- no questions asked. Thank you.

The current replacement I am using still shorts on occasion (I’ve cleaned the connectors). And the red and blue indicator lights seem to have a mind of their own- lights are sometimes “on” when the power is turned off. And vice versa.

For exercise, the product is not good. At all. There seriously is no good position to clip the battery and not have the controller hit your face. And if you position it behind your head, the controller still hits your neck when you move.

This would be a great product if the user sat still and held their breath.

For the quality that the shure is known for, this component is aweful."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many of you, I heard of Shure's sound quality and wanted to own a pair of their earphones. After becoming an owner of the SE215s I was very happy with the purchase until I recently ran into a sealing problem with the foam eartips. I tried cleaning them, but the problem was so bad the earphones continued to leak environment sound and fall from my ears. I reached out to the company and I was directed to buy more accessories from Amazon, then hung up on. With Shure's reputation I expected better customer service, so now instead of buying new eartips I'll be buying new earphones from a company that cares for it's customer's satisfaction."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for about a month, having bought them at one of the audio stores at an airport. After replacing the silicone tips with comply foam tips, the quality of sound and true isolation was fantastic. Nice detailed bass, transparent highs and nice balanced miss. Awesome job for buds that can be had for around $100. They rival the UE triple-fi's that I paid almost $400 for a few years back.

Bluetooth connection - don't get too far from the source, and don't have more than one active Bluetooth connection to your phone or you might have dropouts.

Mic/voice quality... Meh. According to people that I've talked with while using this device, it's a bit boxy sounding, focusing on vocal midrange as opposed to having a rich deep sound. I've played with mic positioning as well-not much difference in quality.

So what you're getting with this is well balanced audio, provided the tips provide a good seal. Silicon tips don't work for me - I only use Comply Foam tips - I'm also a pro bass player and struggled until I found the Comply solution.

Bluetooth can work well if within ten or so feet of the source and no other conflicting BT apps are concurrently running.

Mic vocal quality is ""adequate"".

For $100, this is a no-brainer..."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They produce good audio and are generally fairly comfortable. However, beyond the technical, they are poorly designed. I've had past earbuds at this level from Shure and they consistently have the same problem. Because of the way they fit on the ear, the wire ends up losing a contact somewhere. In the older models, this meant a brand new replacement. On these versions, you can separate the buds from the wire, which tells me the company figured out it was a common problem on the old ones. However, what this now means is that the wire will break every 4-5 months and you'll have to replace that. If you're under warranty, great. However, eventually that ends. I don't want to own a pair of headphones where I have to replace the cable and pay $20 every 4-5 months. I've liked them through ownership but the fact that they can't figure out how to make the wire more resilient is a fatal flaw that the company needs to address. With that, I'm done with Shure products."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these phones to replace an older pair of Shure sound isolating phones I bought several years ago and loved. This set is probably NOT going to work for most people so I would NOT recommend them (I will be returning them).
First, the plug DOES NOT fit in the jack of an Iphone if you have a case on it - you must REMOVE the Iphone from the case to plug them in which is very annoying.
Second, the plugs themselves are difficult to fit into your ear and the cord section right next to the plugs is very stiff which causes the phones to come out of your ears over and over again. The best way to get them to stay in place is to wrap the cord over the top of your ears after inserting the phones and that isn't practical for many people and thus shortens the overall cord length making it inconvenient.
Lastly, the phones themselves spin at the entry point into the ear ALSO causing them to come out of your ear if you move the cord.
All in all, VERY DISAPPOINTING product. The sounds quality is ok but the other factors - can't plug into Iphone if it has a case, and dont stay in your ears outweigh the usefulness."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these but now that I've tried them I'm shocked by all the good reviews. First off the bass is almost non existent, even with my galaxy phone's custom eq bass all the way up its marginal. I was hoping they would stay in place well, I like to use noise isolating headphones while working in my shop using noisy tools, but they fall out easily and don't isolate all that well either. The sound is really sad for this much money. They do look nice, the cord looks heavy duty. I was using Plugfones ear plugs which surprisingly sound better than these but they also keep falling out of my ears. I think these are the worst sounding earphones I have owned."

The cord makes a lot of noise, when it rubs agaisnt my clothing and at the table. They don't feel great inside my ears and it is very uncomfortable to wear then on the go. I also must say that the cord is unnecessarily long. I am 6 feet 3 and there is too much cord hanging when I stand up. I also tried then for a quick run and hated the experience!

The headphones sound amazing. Noise isolation is stellar and I think these are great headphones. The headphones came when expected. Packaging was fine and the box was not damaged at all. But when I plugged in the headphones to my iPad, the sound was funny> It was unbalanced, with more sound output from the right side than the left. I thought maybe it was a connection error, so I tried them on my PC at home and they were buggy with that as well. I do like the memory foam ear tips that are given, they do provide a perfect seal with your ear, (just make sure your ears are clean lol). The quality of the items is probably the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. I think I might have just gotten a bad pair since so many people have given this good reviews. I even bought it after it was recommended on a website as a best buy under $100. Hopefully my return goes smoothly. Might go for the Bose Soundtrue headphones, those were recommended too."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering I've had these for roughly 5 years I definitely owe them a solid review. These were my first real audio investment as a kid, which honestly started an addiction. The buds have been everywhere with me and have always been my go to. For reference I own 7 headphones ranging from $100 (these) to $900usd, including a $3000+ klipsch surround setup from their RP lineup. These easily hit above their class and it amazes me now that they go for $100 (bought them for $200). They have a very bright, happy sound and everything is pure, especially in the mids. They don't slap incredibly with bass heavy stuff, but they'll leave you with a smile, especially if you're a beats user. Of course there are negatives. For example the cables. With daily use and abuse you can burn through them within 6-8 months. But it's not so bad, they are replaceable for a reason and it takes 30 seconds to attach the new ones. I haven't had problems with the connections yet and I recently compared my buds to a pair with about 5 hours on them. Couldn't tell which pair was which unless I looked at them! Ohh and the visuals... the Shure branding will rub off with time and give them that ratty type look, but I don't mind it one bit. Honestly the branding on it just screams ""steal me."" It's like seeing a pair of raybands with that iconic name. I intentionally scrapped the branding off it after a year and now just the inner ""SE215"" remains. If you're stuck between earbuds and full headphones I would recommend the buds (these). They're going to be more cost effective and sound better. I can comfortably say they compete with $300 over-ear headphones. Hooking these up to a tube amp makes them very bright also, which is interesting. Comfort is obviously good - light weight and comfy foam eartips."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased these earbuds, although good, was expecting better !! My go to earbuds are Klipsch Image S4 so I did a few sound and usage comparison tests (I had previously owned a pair of Shure E3's - great treble and midrange, best sound isolation, but no bass and poor durability).

Pros
1. Very good mids and trebles (but not as much as the E3c's)
2. Sound stage was very good and 'up front'
3. Very good sensitivity
4. Lively sounding

Cons:
1. Very clunky to plug in to your ears and for me not the most comforable (not the best for extended sessions)
2. The 3.5mm plug is a bit bulkly
3. Not as good as the Klipsch in terms of expressing sound subtility / timber / musicality
4. Very average in terms of sound isolation (will have to experiment with the different buds)

I've come to the opinion that Shure rellies on their mid/treble capabilities (bass is now better than previously) rather than on ability to bring out subtle parts of the music and general musicality.

[UPDATE]; After trying out different different inserts I ended up switching from medium foam to large foam inserts. This lead to much better sound isolation and sound quality. The delta in sound quality with the Klipsch was significantly reduced but not completely. Comfort also improved a little. (Also tried the large non-foam inserts but were not as good for me)"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,way too complicated to put on..wire and ear piece a nuisance
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these because they allow me to use a set of my mid quality IEM's (215's) wirelessly. They generally get the job done, but there are some issues.

When I use these with my Macbook, the audio skips every 3 or so seconds. Very frustrating. I basically can't use them wirelessly with my Macbook which is one of the main reasons I got this device. I'm back to using wired on the computer.

It works flawlessly on my iPhone X which is definitely nice. Walking around without cords is a game changer, especially with better quality sound than most of the wireless buds you'll find at Best Buy or the like.

I don't like the big battery unit in the middle of the cord. I wish the battery and the mic were housed in one single piece of plastic. I can't really find a perfect position or setup to have these exactly where I want them because the battery is in a sort of frustrating location.

I get a lot of complaints about the microphone. When using my OEM Apple earbuds, I've never had anyone complain about not being able to hear me. But if I talk on the phone with these wireless ones, I get a lot of ""I can't hear you very well"" complaints. I'm usually relegated to actually holding the mic up to my mouth while talking through the BT1's mic.

Overall for me this has become the perfect ""listen to music while on the subway through my phone"" device or any situation where I'm just going to be listening to music or a podcast through my phone. Otherwise there are too many frustrations to use these as much as I'd actually like to (talking on the phone, listening through my Macbook)"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was expecting
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these through an online music store and not through Amazon. I've had them for two and a half months. I sent them back twice already. Once the blue light stayed on constantly and drained the battery and the second time they would not charge. So now, they will not charge at all again! When they did work, I would get occasional dropouts, usually about after 30 min of listening. It seems when you get static noise.....beware....that's when I would start having problems with them. They do not sound as good as the wired SE215 even though the use the same drivers. So, now I have to send them back for a third time. Now, Shure has been quick in replacing them when I sent them in for repair. But, if I was Shure, I would be ashamed of having my name on these. Don't get these! They will be a nightmare to use....that's when they are actually working."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is no doubt that Shure produces the affordable headphone with excellent sound. I am always the big fan of Shure SE215. It provides the excellent output of the base with the detailed quality of the sounds. I was super excited when Shure finally introduces the market with their wireless headphone and I made the purchase without much of the consideration. But my nightmare begins.
Of course, SE215 is still providing its excellent quality of sound. But what makes it is a terrible product cause of the tag design. I guess Shure has no idea how to put the battery to the headphone, so they have to make the tag like design to put the battery. But it is heavy and it swings with body motion. So it is extremely terrible when wearing it in the gym. The tag swings with body motion and attaches to a side of the body after the slide. This makes me want to give up the product and back to Bose family.
One more thing, they do not how to calibrate the connectivity. When you are in a busy public area, the headphone is always get distorted. I never experience any of this with my bose SoundSport wireless.
The connectivity issue and the stupid tag design are totally ruined this excellent headphone!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Within the past few weeks, I purchased a pair of Bose QC3 on-ear headphones. Next, I sent an older pair of Shure headphones in for repair and for a fee, they were replaced with the Shure SE-215 model. Finally, I've received a pair of the Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones for review purposes. While they're all different in a number of ways, they are all very nice sounding headphones. I thought I'd compare the three models.

The challengers:

Bose QC3:

These headphones were recently discontinued in favor of the Bose QC25 headphones. They feature an on-ear design rather than an over-the-ear design like the QC25s or the in ear design of the Shure or Panasonic headphones. These are powered headphones using a proprietary battery. And with this particular model, if the battery dies, the music stops. Fortunately, newer Bose headphones apparently don't have this issue, that is, you can listen to them even with a dead battery. Fortunately, the batteries last a very long time and extra batteries can be obtained at a nominal cost.

These Bose headphone are pretty comfortable. Their ear pieces are apparently made from memory form and because they sit on your ears, they don't get as warm as the over-the-ear models. They are obviously much larger than in-ear headphones, so they'll take up more space in your carry-on bag.

Despite all of this, I probably enjoyed the sound of the Bose headphones the most. I'm not sure that they're the most natural, but they simply sound really good. Price is an obvious consideration, as Bose headphones can run $300 and up easily. These headphones have an electronic noise-reduction circuitry, and while it's imperfect, it will come in handy in noisy environments.

Shure SE-215:

The Shure SE-215 headphones may be the most neutral of the 3 headphones tested. They have a very pleasant, natural and ""effortless"" sound that is highly appealing. While I probably enjoyed the Bose headphones a bit more, I suspect that the Shure headphones are probably the most accurate.

This is an in-ear design with a somewhat awkward fitment which could require a bit of work to properly seat them in your ears. However, once properly seated, the sound is outstanding. Shure provides a nice and very small carrying case with a cleaning tool and a large assortment of rubber and foam earpieces. Foam is recommended for most listeners, as they seem to the the most comfortable and will expand and mold to the listener's ear canal.

Speaking of comfort, I found the Shure headphones to be less comfortable than the Bose headphones and probably the least comfortable of the 3. It's not that they're uncomfortable, but it's hard to forget that they're there. While I don't think the SE-215's are advertised as noise cancelling or noise reducing headphones, noise reduction is likely the best of the three, simply because the tight foam earpiece's seal tends to block out most outside noise. These are really outstanding headphones at a price that I consider to be very reasonable. However, as mentioned, unusual fitment can create a problem getting these headphones fitted just right.

Panasonic RP-HJX5-R:

These are far and away the least expensive of the 3 headphones reviewed. You could possibly buy 10 of these Panasonics for what one pair of Bose headphones cost. While the sound is impressive and well balanced, I found the mid-range vocals to lack presence and the highs to be slightly exaggerated and shrill.

But before I scare you off, I'm nitpicking because the reality is that they sound quite good. I listed to the same track over and over while switching from one headphone to the next to the next, and all 3 were excellent.

Fitment is simple. 3 rubber earpieces (no foam pieces) are provided, along with a tiny velveteen case. Of the 3 headphones discussed, these are the easiest to carry around. Neither these headphones nor the Shure SE-215s require batteries, so that's a definite convenience.

The Verdict:

As noted, I enjoyed the Bose headphones the most. But they're very expensive, relatively large, and some may consider the fact that it has to be used with a battery as a drawback. I rank these headphones #1 in performance, #2 in sound reduction and #3 in value.

The Shure headphones are also excellent, but the fitment is funky. I rank these #2 in performance, #1 in sound reduction and #2 in value.

Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones have outstanding sound and are a steal at the current price. While the sound isn't quite up to that of the Bose or Shure headphones respectively, it's awfully close. I rank these a tight #3 in performance, #3 in sound reduction and #1 in value.

All 3 headphones are outstanding and all 3 carry a 5 star recommendation. As a side note, I purchased the Bose headphones used in ""like new"" condition, so certainly that's an option for anyone who doesn't want to drop hundreds of dollars on the Bose headphones. And for those on a budget, the Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones are very close in sonic quality to the others and far easier on the wallet."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using Westone UM Pro10s, but they kept failing under warranty. For that reason, I was given special permission to return them to the retailer in exchange for another brand, and I chose the Shure SE215s.

The first thing I noticed is that the default earpads were unusually big. It took some wrangling, but I eventually got them off and replaced them with smaller ones. That helped quite a bit, but the monitors themselves aren't nearly as ergonomic as the Westones. The Westones felt as if they were molded to the curvatures of my ears, and could be popped in and out in a second. The Shures, on the other hand, seem bulkier and don't sit well. I really have to cram them into my ears to get them to stay, and even then they occasionally twist themselves out of a tight seal. I never once had that problem with the Westones.

The wires coming from the Westones are light and flexible, allowing you to quickly rest them behind your ears. But the wires coming from the Shures are rigid, and therefore not friendly to people who wear glasses. Even though they can be bent somewhat like a coat hanger, I can't inconspicuously tuck them behind my ears, and sometimes they'll even swivel themselves away from my ears under their own weight.

I have no complaints as far as the clarity of the audio is concerned, but the Shures sounded significantly brighter than the Westones... almost bordering on unpleasant. But they also put out more low end than the Westones. Personally, I prefer the flatter response of the Westones.

I ended up re-purchasing a pair of Westone UM Pro10s, and now I use the SE215's only as a backup when my Westones are away for warranty repair.

POSITIVES:
* Cost $50 less
* Slightly longer cord (allows drummers to clip their headphone amp to their trap case)
* Brighter and deeper response (if that's what you prefer)
* Two-year warranty & lightning-fast warranty replacement service
* Apparently longer-lasting

NEGATIVES:
* Clunky - don't fit as well
* Wiring is too rigid to make inconspicuous
* Sound is a little too brilliant for my taste

UPDATE: After about 1 1/2 years, one of the ear monitors died on a gig. I sent it in to Shure for warranty repair, and they mailed out a replacement extremely quickly."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to earphones I weight comfort, fit, and durability much higher than normal headphones. They're simply far more important because earphones can have a direct impact on the health of your ears. Because of that, the 215s get 3 stars.

Sound:
The sound quality is good for the price. Not amazing, but its better than most headphones at the same price point.

Ergonomics:
They're pretty bad. The wires join too high and too close to your chin, and as a result they pull on the earpieces. The wires also have 2 inch-long reinforced segments that you can mould around your earlobe. The problem is that they're too short and that makes it easier for these segments to be pulled out from behind your earlobe. You have to constantly adjust your phones to make sure they're seated properly behind your lobes.

Shure includes some foam tips that imitate Comply tips but they aren't as comfortable and breathable. The sizing of these tips is poor as there's very little size difference between the small and medium tips but the large tips are almost 40% larger than the medium tips. My ear canals are right smack-dab in that range that is just barely too large for the medium tips and too small for the large tips. As a result, I'm stuck between having to shove the tips in my ear farther than they should be going and dealing with the additional pressure on my concha or i have to use a tip that's too large and deal with the discomfort of the pressure on my ear canal. I thought I could expect better ergonomics from Shure, but I guess at this price, they couldn't care less.

Durability:
I haven't had them for a long time but they seem pretty durable. However, speaking with expertise as a product designer, I predict that the bad ergonomics will wear out the components faster than if Shure had been more generous with the length of the cable. Since the cable itself is modular I'm sure that Shure could offer a better cable but i doubt they'd do it since their consumer earphone line is probably not their most lucrative division."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Until now, I had given up on Bluetooth as a legitimate audiophile’s wireless headphone. Hiss, echo, crackles, and connectivity failures eliminated the purchase of any Bluetooth headset.

Then a salesman at B & H in NYC alerted me to this Shure Bluetooth connection line. Same price as here. My beloved headphones could be wireless...could that be true?

Phenomenal! Clear, crisp delicious sound. You can still here the bassist’s fingers plucking the bass in an acoustic jazz trio. Definition is intact at all levels.

Highly recommended to owners of high-end in-ear Shure cans, like the 535’s. Don’t hesitate to consider this patch line to give wireless life to your in-ear headphones.

5 stars."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these back in May 2014 because I had just got a drum set and I didn't like using headphones while I played(made my ears extremely sweaty). Once I found out that drummers praised these I pulled the trigger and bought them at guitar center. I will admit It take awhile to figure out how to wear these earphones due to the design and I will admit I was ready return them, but I was able figure it out. Comfort is typical of IEM's which in my opinion is satisfactory. When I'm out and about with these they do start to feel uncomfortable about an hour into wearing, but thats just my opinion. I mainly use these when play the drums and these are comfortable for that. Now the sound is fairly balanced. The highs are rolled so don't expect a sparkly treble, but the highs are good. The mids are nice and smooth and the bass is nice and tight. The bass is definitely thick, but it doesn't muffle the mids or highs. Now would I recommend these? Yes if you're a drummer, now if you're a regular person I wouldn't because the design is a bit awkward. For on the go listening I would suggest the Bose sound true Ultra, V-Moda ZN, or if you want an earbud design the bose soundsport would be great too. For the fellow drummer these are perfect."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the SE210's in the past, so I just assumed I'd be getting the same thing with maybe better clarity or frequency isolation or something. I'm not an audiophile, but I am a physicist. So I use the wrong words, but I know it's very difficult to drive 10Hz-20kHz off of one tiny driver. There's always room for improvement.

Shure may have improved things, but they also significantly changed the frequency response. The bass end isn't flat. It goes up significantly. This is basically Shure caving to the Beats phenomenon, where style and loud bass matter more than overall quality.

Granted, the result isn't as terrible as it could be. But I found that the driver couldn't handle mids and highs while the bass had a significant beat. Things get muffled fast.

Not to mention my personal issues with bass. I needed office earphones. The problem is that the bass is too punctuating to me, and I couldn't focus on my work.

So, when the reviews say ""a little bass boost, but not a bassist's earphone,"" that really means there is quite a noticeable bass boost, but at least it's not the only thing you can hear. I don't like significantly altering the sound from how it was mastered, and I don't like the overwhelming bass and mid/high muddiness. Others probably love the boosted bass and focus less on the mids and highs.

Just be aware, and try and check out the frequency response curve to see what I'm talking about."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although without a doubt these earphones sound great, they are not however ideal for working out. Sure you can find the best fit so the earbuds stay snug and fixed in your ear, but they are very sensitive to water or sweat. I primarily used mine for running, but these aren't meant for that. Shure customer service claims that they can withstand heavy sweat based on the fact that a lot of musicians used them on stage, but I've gone through 3 pairs because the detachable earbuds get corroded over time. In spite of disconnecting the earbuds from the detachable cables to let the earphones air out, my earphones still became corroded over time. These earphones barely lasted me a 9 months. Never again would I invest money on Shure headphones. I would recommend looking at other brands that would be good for every condition.

If I were looking for workout earbuds, I would concentrate more on the Bose Soundsport or Jaybirds which is what I'm considering now."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible, they sound like earbuds from the dollar store. They're tinny, lack bass, etc. Everything you don't want in an earbud is in this. Do not buy unless you want to be dissapointed."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My seven year old Shure EC2s were showing their age...and I bought them back when they were *way* more expensive than they were when they were discontinued. I called Shure, direct, for some replacement tips and asked what is the current replacement for the EC2s and they told me about the SE215s. So, even though my old E2Cs still work fine, I gambled on their advice and purchased the new SE215s. My summary of them follows, in no particular order:

1. Sound. In the end all you judge a set of monitors (headphones, buds, etc.) by. They sound as good as the EC2s and that is a serious compliment. Definitely more punchy bass....very evident first time I fired them up. Soundstage is balanced, highs are good, albeit a little less crisp than I'd prefer, but I'm a serious treble freak anyway. Not in the universe with today's monitors geared towards *extreme* bass, which is a compliment by me. Very, very good...a worthy successor to the EC2s in sound quality and imaging.

2. Build quality. They're slightly smaller than past Shure in-ears, which is good. Come standard with the medium, foam inserts. Monumental pain removing these, initially. TIP: Don't try to twist them...get a fingernail under the bottom of the tip barrel and carefully (and with MUCHO force) work them off the main body sleeve. Genuinely, I thought I was breaking them and sending them back they were on that hard. Be forewarned if you don't like the standards tips...after getting them off, all subsequent changes were slick and easy.

3. Cord. Nicer in a way, pain in another major way. Larger cord than prior models, super, super tough. Replaceable too! How cool is that! You *never* see replaceable cords in sub $200 kit, ever. Course, they're also even tougher to remove than the tips, so, again, that's weird. They couldn't, at this price point, make them screw-in; they're snap-in.

4. Fit. Here's where it gets dicey. If these are your first 'in ear canal' monitors, you have a learning curve. Everyone has different ear geometry, so, at first, it's always a crap shoot inserting 'in ears'. The seal has to be perfect and you have to experiment with the various tips to get it *just right*. In my case, I've used Shure's for years, so I've got it down to a science. Even knowing that, these were a bear getting right the first time. Why? Remember those 'larger' cords? They have a moldable, approximately 3-4 inch section that allows the phone's cord to be molded back around your ear (you do know these are 'behind the ear' cord fit, right?) and, until you get used to it, it's a pain. I had to *unlearn* years of fitting to get these things just right.

That said, when you get them in right and crank on the music source, they're very, very good. Again, as good as prior Shure models and at a price point at least 50% less. There are some compromises made (no screw-in cables), cheaper tips than prior models, lack of a rewind spool in the storage case (prior models had them).

But at this price point, who cares? They work fine and are inexpensive enough that you don't baby them like a set of $500 in ear monitors.

But be warned: You will have to take time to:

a) find the right tip that fits your ear's geometry

b) learn to insert and get the cords just right behind your ear

c) learn how to take off tips occasionally and clean them

Great bargain at this price point."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the se215!

I recently bought the symphonized nrg 2.0 for the times when I don't want to deal with my full size headphones. I loved how they sounded, and decided I wanted a more upscale in ear monitor, hence the purchase of the se215. I'm so glad I took the plunge with them. as much as I loved the nrg, the 215 is just in a different league in terms of sound quality.

the 215 is built well. I love the detachable cables, that's a very useful feature if you're rough on your headphones. the overall feeling I get from the 215 is one of quality and durability.

sound quality:

overall sound signature - neutral to slightly warm, with good, but not deep bass impact. balanced comes to mind, though it's far overused in regards to sound signatures. but I'm at a loss so that's what you get!

bass - decent. I wouldn't call these bass monsters at all. but they offer an acceptable level of bass impact for my ears. my nrg in ear hit harder, but with less detail and more boom. the 215 has far more bass quality, vs the nrg bass quantity. I don't like thunderous bass so I prefer the 215 bass.

mids - perfectly mixed with the overall sound signature. the mids are neither recessed or forward, blending wonderfully with the rest of the frequencies. I usually like a mid centric sound signature but not for in ears for some reason. the mids are warm and very well detailed. vocals are great on the 215. there is grain, in my opinion, but it sounds good. I really cant complain for the price.

highs - smooth smooth smooth, yet not rolled off or sibilant. some of the best highs I've heard in a headphone, period. there's just something about the highs on the 215 that I love. they're not the most detailed of all my headphones, nor the smoothest. but I just love them nonetheless. the only other headphone that has highs I like ALMOST as much are my top tier mrspeakers alpha prime. I'm not saying the highs on the 215 are literally as good, they're not. but I just prefer them anyways, they just engage me the most.

soundstage - ok. I have yet to hear an in ear that has a big soundstage like you get with full size headphones. and since I listen to full size headphones for 5-8 hours a day, it's tough to adjust to the in ears when I'm using them. I cant offer more here, sorry. I'm just not that used to in ear models as much.

power requirements - low. in my opinion you don't need an amp. I used the 215 with my lg g4, my wife's iphone 6, and with/without a fiio e12 amp and off brand dac dongle. all I can say is the source had far more impact on the sound than the amp/dac. going from the poor sounding lg g4 to the iphone 6 had a much bigger impact (improvement) on sound quality vs adding the dac/amp to the lg g4. and when adding the amp to the iphone 6, all I really noticed was more headroom. so I'd say an amp is not needed.

comfort - excellent. I have zero issues getting a good seal with the supplied ear tips. no complaints here.

overall I'm really loving my se215. it's a clear step up in sound quality and refinement over the nrg 2.0. I find myself grabbing the 215 far more than my nrg, to the point I might gift the nrg to my cousin. maybe..."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these near the end of 2016. I was between these and Sennheiser's in-ear Momentums. As a budding audiophile, I love these headphones! As far as noise isolation goes, you are completely covered. Whether you are on a loud plane or commute, or simply walking around campus, these puppies got your back. While these headphones aren't conventionally ""pretty,"" the true beauty of these headphones lies in the sound. If you are like me and you listen mostly to Rock, Blues, Jazz, and Folk, then these headphones are what you are looking for. The mids and highs are definitely there, but let me tell you, the lows are out of this world.

My main over-the-ear headphones are the Sennheiser HD 598s and even though I like the over-all sound of those a bit better -- because of the type of music I listen to -- I really enjoy listening with the Shure's because they have their own distinct sound profile. I use a Fiio e10k DAC/AMP while at home and the Sennheiser's dramatically benefit from it, but the low impedance of the Shure SE215-K makes for a great listening experience even without an external DAC or amp. These are perfect for listening to music on-the-go from your favorite Apple or Android device and decent enough that they pair well with my MacBook Pro (late 2013 model). I have the version without the in-line controls, so I can't speak on that matter.

The only negative to buying a pair like this is that, for another $100 you could get something like the RHA T10i IEMs. Not that it detracts anything from the Shure SE215-K, but just something to consider in the long run. I also had to make a similar decision and I personally chose the Shure, because they are the best ""bang for your buck"" as far as pure audio goes. Be warned however, that some people, including myself, experience some ear discomfort after wearing these for a prolonged period of time (after about 3 hours of use), but it is not insufferable.

Overall, these are pretty cool headphones to experience for yourself, even though they might get a bit uncomfortable at times. At this price range, I recommend these IEMs 100%."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphone. I would recommend them to anyone who wants in ear headphones. I have had wireless buds for a while now. While I like Beats Power beats along with the Bose entry in ear buds. I feel the sure SE215 delivers the best all round sound and comfort for the money. The bass is very deep and rich and the highs are good yet could be higher. Noise cancelation can be adjusted by the type of plugs you use with them. I personally enjoy using the Medium foam plugs for the commute on NYC subways. When working out with these headsets it does feel like you are transported into your living room with the stereo blasting. Battery life is fantastic. The 6 plus hours on a charge is a great thing. Power Beats headphones usually last about 3 hours and for how I use that that sometimes does not make it to the days end. I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys their music and want to be free and mobile.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for just under a week and have to say that these are absolutely amazing. I was travelling and forgot to pack my Bose noise cancelling headphones for the flight - which truthfully are way too bulky anyway. I came across these at the airport of all places and am so glad that the sales rep recommended these above all others (value for price - I didn't want to spend too much considering I already had pricey ones at home). It was actually the fit that sold me on these (I was given a disposable sample to try out first). You would think these are not comfortable but they are, there is a bit of wearing in period (for me my right ear canal only) but after a couple days I was used to them or they had adapted - in fact I fell asleep with them on for an entire night and didn't wake up with any issues. There is a process to wearing them but after figuring it out, it gets incredibly easy and the over the ear wire eventually molds to the shape of your ear (this was something the rep had told me about and I have found this to be the case). I've worn these to work out and they never moved at all unlike every other in ear model I have used in the past (I normally use Beats Tours for workouts). Bottom line, I did not hear a single thing other than my music while flying, so objective accomplished. Says something that I've been using these over my other (much more expensive in the case of the Bose) headphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these. My SCL2 series cord actually cracked and I sent them in to get serviced. Long story short, I received these pairs from Shure. I am so happy with these. The buds that come with these are much better than the ones with the SCL2. I am using the expanding foam ones. The first time I used them, they expanded and blocked out the noise. What this meant was much better Bass and clarity. I am a drummer, so using these was incredible. The sound is really clear. As I drum, I hear minimal sounds from the kit and more from the monitors.

I recommend these for musicians. One reviewer said that it was a bad thing that they isolated the sound around you. That means they are doing their job. If you want earphones that bleed the outside noise, then, buy cheaper models, or use the buds that don't use the expansion foam.

I would've given these 5 stars, but the only thing I am skeptical with is that the cord close to the ear buds are very stiff and you have to bend them to conform around your ear and back of your head. I just think that eventually, these too will begin to crack, but we'll see. Maybe that is why they designed them to bend is so that it protects it from cracking. But, that will be determined in the future.

I recommend these monitors for musicians and as a drummer, I can tell you, these work very, very well. Recording or live performances. I use them in both scenarios and they work incredible."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's interesting to read the reviews of this product. While the SE215 perform better acoustically than cheaper ear buds, it's not a very high bar to to surpass to be honest. Simply due to the physical limitations involved in making an acoustic device this size, most modestly priced ear buds sound absolutely horrible. So using ear buds as a benchmark, the SE215 sound better than average, but not better than a cheap pair of full headphones. I have a $20 pair of Philips headphones that completely destroy the SE215 acoustically. They have a more extended and balanced sound stage. And I can pop them on in 2 seconds, not the 30 seconds it takes to fit the Shures.

So, I'm not a huge fan of ear buds for critical listening. I purchased these to use as in-ear monitors in my band - a utilitarian purpose to which they perform reasonably well, but that's where my use of them begins and ends. Compared to modestly priced headphones, they just can't compete sonically. I wonder how many people who gush over the sound quality have ever tried a good budget pair of headphones at a fifth of the price. I guess many who rate these so highly don't know how sonically superior a half-decent set of headphones can sound.

Ultimately, they provide sufficient audio quality for casual listening, and enough isolation to do a pretty good job as IEMs. But they are a long way away from what I would consider high fidelity sound. And as a set of earphones for casual listening, they are a real hassle to fit."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the perfect headphones. They have ""memory wire"" and so can fit snugly on your ear while you are jogging. They feature a replaceable cord (replacements are a bit expensive at like $30, but still, a very nice feature). They sound great. They are perfect.

I've used a number of earphones over the years. These sound better than the Etymotic MC5's to me. At least they are more tremendous while still giving good detail. And they fit better, have better ergonomics. The other are the Meelectronics M6 sport. Those are significantly more affordable, at around $20, but they don't sound nearly as good.

Don't bother with other headphones, which fall out of your ears, have their cords get frayed, etc. Just buy one pair of these, and be set FOR LIFE."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my 225's for years. I'm still completely satisfied with them. I've actually owned several SE models, including a pair in the 400 range (my dog ate them and I couldn't afford a new set... So I bought some newer 225's). These are phenomenal headphones. Sound quality is brilliant, I still hear things in songs I've been listening to for years that I never noticed before. Well balanced signature, and crisp clean sound makes any music genre pop in these. The over ear design takes a little getting used to, but once you get it, they feel very natural and secure. I find them very comfortable for long listening sessions.
I use these on long plane rides, and while they are not noise cancelling they do isolate well enough for me to drown out the plane easily. As I said before, I've had them for years. Durability has definitely been a surprise as their previous models had issues with wires shorting. While I would love to be writing a review of the 500 series, these have been making me a happy listener for so long I had to review them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an updated review which reflects additional experience and adversity with these headphones. Initially, I was unable to establish a tight seal with my ear canals when placed in the prescribed orientation. This resulted in the base and overall sound quality being compromised substantially. After a few days, I decided to approach the seal issue by replacing the medium-size memory foam pads installed by the manufacturer with the large size included with the unit. I soon discovered that it is not possible to remove the pads by following the instructions provided in the manual. They will not rotate or comply in any manner with attempts to dislodge them. I was certain that if I applied any additional force that the nozzles would snap off. After a great deal of effort, I was finally able to remove them by stretching, pulling and deforming with a surgical hemostat. Of course, the pads were destroyed in the process. I then installed the large set of memory foam ear pads and the problem was solved. The sound is considerably richer, but not a great leap beyond the quality of my less expensive Sennheiser buds. The wires around the tops of the ears are a nuisance and do little to stabilize the earphones. I am definitely not looking forward to the next time that I have to replace the pads."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In short, these are amazing for under $100.

I'm not really an audiophile, but I did a lot of research on IEMs (earbuds that sit deep in the ear), and I thoroughly tested a few of my finalists. So, in this review I'm going to compare the Shure SE215's ($99), Shure SE425's ($299), and Etymotic Research ER-4PT's ($299). My main selection criteria were comfort, sound quality, and ability to block out outside noise (note that for this reason I first tried the Bose QuietComfort 20i's, but the active noise canceling pressure made my ears hurt).

SHORT SUMMARY: I easily recommend the SE215's in terms of price-performance; but, if you have more to spend then get the SE425's. The ER-4PT's are very crisp, but they have some significant physical downsides.

LONGER REVIEW:

First of all, I hear that it's important to choose headphones based on the kind of music that you listen to. So, for my tests, I used ten songs representing my favorite genres of EDM (house/trance), synthpop, and pop rock. Songs included Instant Crush (Daft Punk), Good Morning Kaia (BT), Crush (Dave Matthews Band), and A Sky Full of Stars (Coldplay).

Overall, the SE215's are excellent, especially for the price. When switching back and forth between them and the 425's, I could notice a clear difference, but not necessarily a $200 difference. If $200 isn't a huge deal to you, definitely get the 425's; but, I think you'd have to be a very discerning listener to really appreciate the increase in quality.

So what's better about them? Everything is clearer. After listening to the 425's, the 215's feel almost like a light blanket was thrown over the speaker -- everything is just a little muddier and the individual instruments are less clear. There's less separation between the layers. But again, this wasn't a dramatic difference, so you'd still be very safe with the 215's (and I understand that $300 is an insane amount of money for most people to spend on earbuds).

What about the ER-4PT's? They were even clearer, but almost clinically so. It felt a bit like I was in a perfectly empty room listening to every little nuance of the sound, but that sound was less warm than that of the Shures. To be honest, though, this difference was minimal -- in most cases, there wasn't a hugely noticeable difference between the ER-4PT's and the SE425's. I most preferred the Etymotics in songs involving crisp cymbals and complex background noises; but again, it wasn't a huge difference, and overall I slightly preferred the warmer bass of the Shures.

More importantly, I found two dealbreakers that meant I couldn't keep the Etymotics: (1) That crisp clarity of sound sadly translated to the wire as well; every time I moved my head I could powerfully feel/hear the wire moving, to the point that it was quite distracting. I believe that this is called microphonics. (2) The plastic piece connecting the wire going to each ear was surprisingly heavy, to the point that its weight very quickly became annoying compared to the other earbuds.

The other nice thing about the Shures is how easily they slip into your ears. Fair warning that it took me a while to figure out how to get them in right -- I was about to return them because it was so confusing at first, but I watched a youtube video and realized you have to actually significantly bend the rubbery part. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fast and easy to fit them in compared to the Etymotics that I really had to work in every time while holding my ear open with my other hand.

So, like I said, I recommend either one of the Shures depending on how much money you can spare on headphones. One other tip, by the way: Be very careful about trying all the different types of tips that are included. I noticed a dramatic difference when I finally found the right set that made a truly tight seal in my ear canal -- the bass became significantly stronger and the overall sound became tighter and cleaner.

Overall, I definitely recommend IEMs over regular earbuds (unless you're riding a bike or something that demands attention), but keep in mind that none of these will fully block out nearby voices on their own -- I needed to play white noise or music to achieve the true isolation I was looking for."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a ton of research for a good set of IEM's. I own the bose and just felt something had to deliver the level of sound and accuracy I was looking for. I did stage sound for 10 years for some fairly notable bands and have an idea what music should sound like. I considered IEM's from $100 to $500. Of course, like anyone, if I could get what I wanted for the $100 mark then great. So I started with the Shure se215's.
Well I'm done looking. These are the best bargains on Amazon. I am an audophile and have worked in million dollar studios. These IEM's knock it out of the park.
Don't get me wrong.... there are certainly better ones out there , but not for $100. 90% of people out there don't require the level of accuracy you get from a $500 set of IEM's.
If you're not rich or have some sort of particular need stop looking and buy these.
Yes, give them some time to burn in (80 hours) but the rewards are fabulous.
I would have paid $500 if I though the return was worth it. No chance. These ROCK.
I listen to everything from Foo Fighters to Barbra Streisand, Eagles to David Grusin, Radio Head to Yanni. I set my EQ to flat and these perform magnificently."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 years my first pair was stolen, now 3 years later, my second pair is still going strong. I cannot stress enough how crystal clear and BEAUTIFUL the audio is from these earphones. I've accidentally rolled over the cord with my office chair like 50-100 times and they just keep ticking. What a beautiful piece of hardware.
I've tested the much higher-end earphones and headphones from SHURE, beats, sony, bose .etc (the sales guys all got different brands for testing) and I keep coming back to the 215s... I've also convinced nearly our entire office of 30 staff to switch to these inexpensive monsters of audiophile beauty. I cannot stress enough how perfect these are, and how much they will change your frikkin' life.

Note: USE THE FOAM EARPHONES!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough....
The silicon attachments may last longer, but the foam ones provide WAY MORE comfort and sound quality. Just a tip from someone coming from thousands of hours of experience."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds sound very good. Contrary to what some have said, they have good bass response once you get the right seal. They fit well and are easy to put on once you get used to doing it. As far as i can tell, they will never fall out during normal use.

I use them for in-ear monitors for performing and recording. The only fault i can find, and this is likely true of all in ear monitors, is that they seem to amplify the sound of your voice ""in your head"". This is likely due to the sound isolation, as you get the same effect if you simply plug your ears with your fingers. So that takes some getting used to. If you don't think you can deal with it your other option would be headphones. I'd recommend the Sony MDR-V6. They are totally transparent with no bass boost built in.

I would recommend these to musicians and audiophiles who want good sounding ear buds costing less than $100.

Update 5/26/14;
I found that selecting just the ""right"" tips can optimize these buds for different applications. For listening to music recordings, a tight fit maximizes bass response and isolation. For use as an in-ear monitor, it seems a slightly looser fit is desirable, allowing for somewhat less isolation and providing a more neutral sound with slightly less bass. It takes a bit of experimenting to find the right tips for each application..but the results are well worth the effort. For me, the best selection turned out to be the large rubber tips for listening to music and the medium rubber tips when i use them as monitors.

Hope this helps."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned a pair of Shure's before (e2c, which I bought a while ago), one of the prime concerns I had about purchasing another IEM was the durability. Immediately upon opening the packaging (complete with carrying case) and taking a look at these, I could tell the SE215-K is a different beast from it's historical predecessors These feel miles ahead of the build quality of my e2cs, which have long been dead from wear (they lasted a good 2-3 years under moderate use). One idea I really like is the stiffer, protected plastic around the wire, which makes it a little harder to easily adjust the wires, but definitely makes the wires less able to wear and break, a common problem with thinner headphone wires at the joints.

The sound isolation is what you would expect from an IEM, essentially acting as an earplug. Obviously, people's ear canals are different, and as such these come with the requisite package of different-sized rubber inserts. However, there are now a softer, plushier foam ear inserts which expand, another great idea and something new to me. They feel very comfortable, and I've found I prefer them over the more-traditional rubber bullet-style inserts which are also included. I was able to find several good fits between the sizes included.

As for the sound, I have never been the biggest fan of IEMs for quiet listening (better to throw on a pair of over-the-ear headphones, etc.) but these do an admirable job with music on a train or while travelling. The bass is punchy, and the mids and highs are what I'd come to expect from a Shure IEM. At times, music clarity can be lacking compared to larger headphones, but the ease of driving these, the sound isolation, durability, and comfort

Ultimately, I wasn't blown away by the SE215s, but was impressed by some of the small changes and am happy they have fulfilled my expectations so far."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my SE215, works as described .. Do note that it uses SBC codec over bluetooth, it doesnt support apt-x or apt-x hd. Given the fact that Shure got into the game late with BT, figure they would add apt-x hd but guess not. Nonetheless, sound quality is still excellent. Despite not having apt-x, it still sounds better than alot of the cheaper apt-x bluetooth headphones. Battery life is good so far, I mainly use these for the gym and single charge will last me about 4 workout sessions. Love how the shure fits over the head, gives it a nice secure fit while other cheaper BT headsets I got tends to fall out. Another nice feature is when you first turn on the headset, the voice will give you a estimated time remaining on the battery (ie. 2 hours, etc...). Took a star off due to it being a bit overpriced and lack of apt-x support but it makes up for it for still sounding great. Using this with Pixel XL on Oreo."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these earbuds for a little under a year now, and the right ear bud went. I sent it back to Shure under warranty (which is 2 years) and they sent back a new piece in less than a week. That’s solid customer service, even though I was a little disappointed that it even happened.
In the week I was without these earbuds, wow did I miss them! They are the best earbuds I own, and all those cheap Skull Candy’s and the like are just not up to snuff of the big dogs like Shure. The sound is amazing, lots of power, a nice mix of treble and bass (at first I thought too bass heavy, but I have gotten over it over time) and most importantly they truly block out background noise. After the learning curve of trying to figure out how to put them in my ears quickly, I am now a pro and recommend these highly."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Following the death of an older pair of earphones and the purchase of the ""updated"" version (I.E. far worse), I decided it was time to upgrade. I've got a preference for open-ear headphones/earphones because of the improved sound stage they typically offer, but this time around, I was after something with a lot of noise isolation. People instantly suggested noise cancelling headphones and earphones, which made me laugh. Active cancellation is horrible. To the point, though. After two months of looking, I opted to pick up the SE-215s.

Out of the box, the fit wasn't great, but I expected this. Still, I listened to them for an hour with the stock ear-tips, so I can confirm something I've been seeing: without the right fit, these are not going to feel like they're worth $100. The noise isolation doesn't work very well, and the sound quality suffers. Get the right tips on them, and it's a different story.
After throwing on the biggest tips, things started looking up quickly. With very little volume from my tablet (A Nexus 7, which is their primary source), I couldn't hear anything around me at all. At half volume, a loud basketball game may as well have not been going on. Get the right tips, and the isolation WILL follow. In fact, I've seen people mention that you don't want to use these in places where you need to be able to hear some of what's going on around you, and they're right. The isolation is crazy.

Another point of these I've seen discussed is the fit. People keep mentioning the ""Shure fit."" This comes back down to the tips you have on your earphones. If you have the wrong tips, they're not going to be very comfortable. With the right tips, however, they almost vanish into my ears. Unless I pay close attention, I can pretty easily forget that they're there, though I'm very prone to spending long periods of time (upwards of six hours with minimal breaks) with headphones/earphones on/in. As such, I'm used to long-duration wear. Still, with the right tips, these are very comfortable. Not once have I had to take them out because they were bothering me, even after sleeping in them for a full 9 hours. (On that note, if you want a pair of earphones to sleep in, these also work great. They sit deep in the ear with a minimal profile on the outer ear, so it's possible to lay on them and feel no discomfort. May not work well for people with small ears, though.)

What about the sound? Again, this is dependent on the tip you have. Get the right tip, and the trinity (isolation, comfort, and sound) show up at the same time. People complain that these are bass-heavy, and I agree to a point. These earphones are not in any way neutral. The bass does come through strongly enough to make the mids feel thin and the highs muffled. That being said, it's nowhere near as bad as those abominations known as Beats. Music is still very easy to listen to and enjoy, and unless you're a big fan of Grado and Sennheiser, I'm not sure you'd really feel that the bass was overpowered at all. The attribute that takes the biggest hit is vocals, but again, that's coming from Grado and Sennheiser, both of which are very, very good at bringing out all parts in the mix equally.
Continuing to focus on the tips, changing them is a royal pain in the ass the first time. I nearly ruined the default pair trying to get them off. It's going to take a while, so don't rush it. Literally took me 20 minutes to get both sides changed out.
Overall, I strongly suggest these. They do exactly what I wanted them to do with ease, and for $100, I'm not sure how much better it could have been done. The cables are detachable, and if you want, you can get cables to use them with your iPhone or Android phone. Can't comment on the functionality of either, as I despise iPhones and don't have the cash for a decent Android phone right now.

On an unrelated note, I wish these were waterproof. I actually don't like taking them out first thing in the morning to go and nab a shower. It's nothing worth complaining about, though it's the only thing I think they could improve on in this price range. As far as better sound quality goes, I'm not sure what to say other than to jump up to the SE-425s or higher."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Two years ago, my Shure E2C IEMs finally gave up on me. I really liked those. At the time, they were the best I could find for the price. Since then, I have tried several sets, such as Monster Turbine, Polk 6000, Bose IE2, and a couple others. Of the group, i surprisingly liked the Monsters the best for their audio, although the ear pieces were heavy. That pair finally broke a few months back, and I have been searching for a new set, trying to stay @ or below $100. After trying out a couple models, and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to come back to Shure. As soon as I put these on, my first thought was, ""Why did I ever leave Shure?"".

Shure has a whole line if IEMs, and these are the entry level for them. But entry level for Shure is way better than many others.

PROS:
Full range audio - with natural sound that appeals to all the music I enjoy (which is an eclectic mix of pretty much anything)
The fit...oh the fit - I personally like the foam tips that you squeeze, insert, and let fill your ear canal. They seal perfect, and stay in.
The over the ear design of the cables - These wrap around behind your ears to provide a more secure and comfortable fit. The old E2Cs were this way, and I had missed it. This generation is actually nicer in that you can conform the over ear portion to hold in place better.

CONS:
I wouldn't mind a lower price :)
Um, well, I'll let you know when I find another one."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for the captivating sound, kept it because I could never justify buying another pair of ear buds. Through countless hours of daily gym use, drenched in sweat, and countless more sitting in my pockets while I do active things at work. I simply don't worry about these phones no matter what I do because I don't need to. They have always been there for me and will continue to be as long as I don't lose them.

One time I was loading a bar and I literally smashed one of them between two 45 lb plates. It broke off the little stem where the pad goes, so I gorilla glued it back and 6 mos later I'm still using it... It's completely modular so I think if it breaks again I'm just gonna send the one bud in to get fixed for like $25 because Shure rocks.

You can sleep with these without them puncturing your ear drums because the body sits on your ear bone. You also can't hear a damn thing with them on. I bought a new set of the foam pads recently and love these phones all over again. The sound hasn't changed in 3 years of abuse.

I keep oogling at other headphones, but then I remember what I have waiting for me at home and I realise that the grass isn't all that greener than what I got.

I love these phones."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work in a fairly noisy environment, so I need a noise-isolating in-ear monitor. I have tried several models, and the Shure SE215-K is the best I have found in the under-$100 price range. There are three categories in which I evaluate in-ear monitors: sound quality, in-ear fit/comfort, and cable quality. The SE215-K excels in all three areas.

The Shures are very good-sounding monitors. They deliver a well-balanced sound across all frequency spectrums. I have found that many in-ear monitors over-emphasize the bass frequencies, resulting in a somewhat ""boomy"" sound. The bass response of the SE-215Ks is very full, but without going over the top and sounding unnatural. Mids are clear and well-defined, and high frequencies are reproduced smoothly without sounding overly sibilant or tinny. This is quite an achievement for a single-driver system, but the Shures do very well.

Fit/comfort is an essential quality of any in-ear monitor. This is, of course, very subjective, as everyone's ears are shaped differently. I have personally had difficulty finding in-ears that fit me well, but the Shures do not have this problem. The Shures come with six sets of ear buds, three sizes each of rubber and memory foam units. Once I found the best-fitting set (the large rubber ones), I found that the sound isolation properties were excellent. One word of caution: these are intended to be used as stage monitors, which means they are designed so that the cable goes up and behind the ears. This is not an optional feature of this product; you won't get a good fit unless you do this. I found that this took a bit of getting used to, but with practice I learned to remove/replace the monitors quickly and easily.

The last category is cable quality. I learned about this category the hard way, as monitors that I have used in the past had terrible cables that would kink or--worse--produce significant microphonic feedback. For those not familiar with this phenomenon, microphonic feedback is when contact with the cables (touching with hands, rubbing against clothing) results in audible artifacts in the monitors themselves. The cable acts as a microphone and transfers the sound to the monitors. The Shure SE215K cable is free of both of these problems. I have had no issues with the cable kinking (if anything, it is a bit too stiff, but I have found this to be manageable), and its microphonic properties are negligible.

Having just described the cable, I want to note that I use the cable that includes the microphone (an actual microphone, not an accidental one)and the three-button controls for my iPhone, not the default cable that comes with the monitors. I have used the controls on this cable and found them to be high-quality. The buttons are easy to access and distinguish by touch, and they provide good tactile feeback. I have had no sound quality issues using the microphone. The only complaint that I have is that Apple does not provide side tone (i.e., the sound of one's own voice) when using monitors to make a phone call. This means the user cannot hear his own voice when talking--and this is made worse by the sound-isolating ear buds. This is disconcerting, and as a result I typically do not make calls in this way. However, it's there in a pinch.

I can recommend the SE215K monitors over the Klipsch S4 and the ME Electronics CC51P units. I have logged significant time with both of these monitors. The sound of the S4s is OK (the bass can be on the ""boomy"" side), but I was never able to achieve a comfortable fit in my ears. I had all sorts of problems with the CC51Ps, but the worst was the microphonic cable. The slightest movement is very audible, which made them all but unusable. My issues with the Klipsch have more to do with my ears than with the overall quality of the product (I happen to think highly of Klipsch products in general), though I cannot say the same for the ME Electronics monitors. All that notwithstanding, the SE 215K beats both of those monitors in all three categories. I would recommend this product to anyone."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound really good for ear buds. I use them a lot at work. My biggest freaking problem with these is the dumb design of the wire up and over your ear. The wire NEVER stays put for me and always comes off the top of my ear. Perhaps I don't have a huge ear and that is the problem. But I find it super annoying that when I turn my head just a few times the wire should be tucked behind me ear isn't anymore causing it to pull on the ear bud which then dislodges from my ear.

I would have much preferred normal ear buds that just hand straight down. Shure makes nice things and they are super pricey to boot, but this is the last time I'm buying this type of a design. I can't even work out with these because there is NO way in doing any activity that would make the wires stay behind the ears."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Summary: Fantastic, balanced and clear sound. Tight, comfortable fit. Breakaway cord means you can replace the wire without replacing the whole thing.

Sound: In a nutshell, this are very clear, accurate earbuds that let you hear every detail of your music. They are so clear, you may find yourself upping the bitrate on your music to hear every last detail.
Bass: Clean, natural, accurate reproduction. Not a bass-heavy version, so if you like bumping bass for your hip hop, could be the wrong thing. Still has present bass, just not artificially boosted.
Mids: Very clear and accurate sounding.
Highs: The highs are a little more pronounced on these than some others, giving nice hi hats and upper vocal definition.

To call these perfectly in balance, I would probably turn down the treble by 5% and give it to the 3% to the mids and 2% to the bass, and that's probably what you get when you upgrade to the next level. But overall very very solid.

Fit is tight without hurting your ears. The Shure wraparound design means the cord isn't always trying to pull the earbuds out of your ears, so you can have a tighter fit without being so tight your ears start to hurt after a while.

In past models, this meant that if you jerked on your cord or dropped your phone the wire might get stretched or even break, because they don't come out of the ear easily. I had to replace them twice, and finally gave up and went to something else. I'm pleased to see they addressed that problem with a breakaway cord that disconnects from the more expensive hardware. I assume this means cheap and easy replacement of only the wire.

To Shure's credit, in the last model before they added the breakaway, they shipped me new ones completely free of charge twice! So I trust this company. Plus, I've listened to lots of $100 headphones and these are by far my favorite. Most headphones jack the bass or lack that sonic sound even if they're clear. These are genuine hifi earbuds."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something to replace my motorcycle headphones. I had a pair that worked fairly well. They were the type that you form the two-part hardening plastic mold into your ear. However, the cord broke on the second pair. So, time to find something new.

First: I'm a bass player and I'm also an audiophile. I've spent multi-thousands on my home system, so I'm pretty familiar with good sound quality.
Second: I mostly need these for riding motorcycles (Ducati 900 with loud pipes) as well as yard work around loud yard appliances.

These seal out the noise great! I get as much out of the seal as I do wearing my standard foam bullet ear plugs. Note: I did NOT get that kind of seal out of the standard foam plugs that come installed on the plugs. I swapped out the foam for the rubber seals. Rubber seals are where it's at!

Also, bass was not great when I first tried them on with the foam plugs. I played around with my iPhone settings (already on the bass-booster setting) and couldn't get the bass I wanted. I swapped to the rubber seals and bass was there in spades! I've now got the iPhone set on ""Flat"" and it's the most full audio presentation I've ever gotten out of earbuds. I say full, not flat. They are not flat. I don't have a way to measure them, but I'd estimate there is a 3db mid-bass peak (maybe 80 hz?) and they are full enough to produce good bass tones down to the ""B"" string on an electric that has the lower string. Treble is good, maybe a touch grainy, but these aren't $1K earbuds or $10K speakers, right? They actually have a touch of soundstage vs the typically flat-2D soundstage of most earbuds.

They fit under my Arai full-face helmet perfectly. I don't even feel them when I take the helmet on and off. My old ones would catch on the cheek pad and kind of press the buds into my ear canal. These don't. I think these are the kinds of earbuds that I can wear all day on a ride and not get an ear canal ache. Time will tell. We'll see how well they wear and last, too. Hopefully longer than the 12 months my last buds lasted."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these recently as part of a serious effort to find earbuds that deliver quality sound, secure fit, and affordable enough that I wouldn't be distraught if I lost them.

These fit the bill perfectly. I used to own a pair of the previous-generation Bose in-ear phones. Really great sound, but they never sat very securely in my ears. I see that they have recently modified the ear attach point, but I was skeptical nonetheless.

I tried these because of great reviews and the fact that I was able to purchase them at slight discount. The result is that I am extremely satisfied. So satisfied, that I am seriously considering purchasing on of the dual-driver models to get the sound to the next level. But these are more than adequate for daily use.

Sound is balanced and clean. Not bass-biased like some more popular name brands. The younger me would have chased that bass sound, but the more even balance of these headphones are much better.

Also, crucially, the fit is extremely secure without being uncomfortable. Most other earbuds I've tried are not well suited to normal movement. These can handle a great deal of head movement without requiring readjustment.

These earbuds have made me a believer and I will definitely buy from Shure again."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the best audio device I've ever used.
SOUND:
I'm not any crazy picky audiophile or anything but these headphones give the best quality I've heard from anything else, including the 60$ ear buds I was previously using and any headphones I've gotten my hands on. I doubt anyone would have a problem with the sound quality of these, they're better than I could have imagined. The ear buds are as well very good sound isolators. When in they block out most noise and when playing you can't hear anything. If I'm trying to sleep and others are up making noise having these in makes it really easy to fall asleep. I always use these on vacations as well for the same purpose. Plus they work as good earplugs at concerts, especially because you can remove the wire.
LIFESPAN:
The longest I've ever had ear buds last before these was 6 months. Ear buds are notorious for bad lifespan, but even with replaceable wire the first wire outlasted that, going 9 months before one ear bud started flickering. The second wire lasted 6 months and I've just gotten my third. Keep I mind I took no precaution to treat these wires well, I stuff them in my pocket everyday to take with me and over the past year and a half have used them on average at least 9 hours a day. These are definitely workhorses. For about $145 now I've gotten great quality sound for 16 months and continuing, great deal.
COMFORT:
Among everything that is great about these ear buds this is the one big con. After having these ear buds in for more than an hour my ears would get sore. The buds are pretty big so having these in for long can make your ears pretty sore. In the beginning this was a big problem, however after very frequent use of these for 3 months or so, I can now keep these in all day and not have any discomfort. Because I've had them for so long this doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, it was worth it for how long I've had them. Still something to consider if this is a big concern. You probably wouldn't like these if you have small ears."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I have found them to be comfortable, even for long periods of wear. Additionally, I find them to be comfortable to wear even while sleeping. I am a stomach sleeper and my previous headphones were impossible for me to wear while falling asleep because my ear against the pillow created pressure and became uncomfortable after a very short amount of time. The sound quality from these is superb and they block out so much noise. I can barely even hear the lawn mower running when I have these in."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just want add my 2 cents to this companies product, I know that a lot of people have complained about the newer version and that's fine. the pair I have is I gotta say 10 years old. I did a lot of landscaping and mowing. I went through about 10 sets of headphones till I tried out this companies. at the time they were 125 and that was low end model. I was sitting on 62inch mower and had to reach down and feel the side of seat to know if it was running. The superior outside noise blocking allowed me to turn my ipod down to such a low lvl it wasn't blairing in my ears. Mind you this is for an older model. The clarity alone was worth the money. and the battery life of my ipod was even better. I still have them today and have had no problems with wires or sound problems. I lost a few of the buds and contacted company, they sent me out a new bud package at no charge. When I travel on a train or long bus I bring these and I can crank up whatever I am watching for a movie and people around cannot hear it at all. (some people like to share their music with others) I wish I could give a review about the newer models but havnt had to buy a new pair since others are still going strong."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall great headphones for the price, amazing isolation.

Isolation:
Superb. They isolate more than the Vic First Drumming headphones, which isolated very well. Instead of muffling the highs like the Vics, These cut out most of the bass. My kick sounds completely flat with no low end while wearing these. This is great, because when you're monitoring or playing with music, you don't get all the muddy noise, but you can still hear the attacks from your kit through the seals. You can always monitor your kit and get the low end back that way.

Sound:
Very bassy, not in the muddy way, but in the deep way. They get really low, powerful frequencies instead of just amplifying most of the low end like a lot of cheaper headphones, which muddies up the sound. Still, these are very bassy.

Weird thing:
The foam ear tip was super hard to take off the earphone to the point where I was worried that I would break them. No damage, but it's tough to get off/on."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love music, no I really do. If I thought I could've made money at it I would have jumped at the chance. So I need pretty good ear-buds. I'm not rich or anything close to it. So 2, 3 or 4 hundred dollars for ear-buds is more than I want to spend. But I've had a few (last being SIEGE)and they always broke in a shorter time than expected. I'm not hard on them by any means, but I use them everyday to hold off the sounds of the world I live in. I NEED good/great sound. A comfortable fit and ease of use. Outside of that if they looked great it a plus. These SHURE SE215's are all that and more. Afterwards I bought from Amazon the interchangeable IPod cable.

Pros: The sound is like being there (I've heard things I didn't here on my considerable home system.
Price $100.00 I bought them outside of Amazon from a dealer close by (that would honor a return if needed)
They look extra cool to me in my ears and in my hand. They are clear and stand out because of it.
The construction is soo much better than anything I've used, it's incredible.
The cable can be disconnected if damaged or in my case upgraded to one with an IPod controller and on cord Mic.
++ They block 95% of the the external sounds around you.

Cons: Getting them in correctly took some practice. They go in upside down from the way they look (like stage musicians wear them)and the cords go OVER your ears and in back.
Getting the correct bud will take trail and error.
-- They block 95% of the the external sounds around you. Some people will feels really vulnerable when are disconnected from their surroundings.

Verdict- Where have they been all my life. I think I will get this brand of ear-buds from now on. They seem built to last and they sound wonderful. Nuff said."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(Review copied from previous Amazon account). This is my second pair of Shure in-ear monitors. The first endured five years of heavy use before the cable failed. I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable.

The quality is outstanding....the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me well). The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble. However, these do have a somewhat forward sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some in-ear monitors convey (Etymotic comes to mind).

That said, I believe 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's. Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed above and behind the ear for a secure fit. This does secure the fit, but can be slightly awkward for glasses wearers.

Update: After several years of steady use the Shure CBL-M+K Accessory Music Cable (separate item) that I purchased along with these began to fray and was replaced by Shure, free of charge under warranty. Recently, the earbuds and cable were inadvertently stepped on, breaking the right earbud and the accessory cable. After sending to Shure, they were both replaced for a VERY fair price. With such reliable customer service, I'm a Shure customer for life."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 215's are simply awesome! Especially for the money. I am a drummer and was looking for something that cut out at least 30db from my acoustic drums, but also a pair of in ears that sounded good. Shure claims that the 215's cut of up to 37 db's and I was floored when I put these in for the first time. I can guarantee that I am getting near 37 db less when these in ears are put in properly. Those who claim that they aren't getting any noise reduction are probably not get a proper seal.

These things sound great, very clear mids and highs, and very good lows as well. I was concerned that there might not be a lot of low end from the 215's, but I was pleasantly surprised. The low end is very good! They're also very comfortable and can be worn for hours without fatigue. I prefer the medium foam sleeves that were already on the 215's as they provide great isolation and comfort.

I was debating on getting the 315's and couldn't decide which ones to get but thought that the 215's might actually have more low end. I haven't heard the 315's so I can't speak about them., but I can tell you that the 215's exceeded my expectations. I've had them for a month now and haven't had any problems. I believe some people may be having problems because they are not cleaning them. Check out videos on YouTube regarding how to clean the SE 215's. I highly recommend these in ears, especially for people who area looking for nice sound quality with very good sound isolation. You will be very happy with your purchase."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third pair of Shure 'over the ear' earbuds. My last pair, which I enjoyed for many years, developed a short in the wiring, so it was time to order a new pair.
I use my earbuds for running and cycling, so a good, solid fit is very important to me. With most earbuds I've tried I seem to be constantly pushing them back into place. No so with my 215s.

Fit: some wearers have mentioned that they had a hard time fitting the 215s in place. I found them very easy to fit and they stay in place throughout my 5 to 10 km runs. I think wearing 'behind the ear' earbuds for many years made fitting and wearing the 215s easier, compared to someone who has never worn this type of earbud.
If you're having trouble getting them to fit properly, don't give up. Once you get accustomed to putting them in place you'll love them.

Sound: Very clear and bright, but I wish they had a bit more bass. These earbuds don't seem to fit as tight as my last set of Shure earbuds. They let in more outside noise, which I don't mind. It lets me hear more of what's going on around me. Note that I use the 'ribbed' rubber ear pieces which usually give a deep fit.

Quality: I like that the wires can be replaced. This is a good news, as the speaker unit seems to last a lot longer than the wires."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - Solid build, very comfortable in my ears (in contrast to a couple reviews complaining about discomfort after a long listen), good sound quality

Cons - Like a few other people have said, the bass is there, but it's less felt than it is heard.

Firstly, I should say that I don't have a much experience with IEMs. My only other pair was the Bose ie2 that my friends mistakenly threw away (Yeah, they threw away a $150 pair of headphones... I was more than a little frustrated). I got these as a gift, and, out of the box, I have to say I was a little disappointed. The Bose that I had before had good sound quality and had very good bass for an IEM. And that's where I got hung up on these.

The Shures lack the ""feel"" of the bass that the Bose have. When I first started listening, they sounded shallow. Good mids and uppers, but lacking the bass I was looking for, that is, until I had tried them out for a few days.

After the initial listen, I was left a little disappointed, so I set them off to the side. I started using them more the last few days and have done a soft 180 on my first opinion. The bass isn't what I was hoping for, but the clarity of sound throughout the range of pitches more than makes up for it.

Definitely the best earbuds/IEMs that I've owned as far as clarity goes, but a slight disappointment on the bass end of things. I would recommend them for anybody that isn't a basshead and is looking for a solid set of IEMs."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. I am a nervous flier, and flew by myself for the first time in 2011. I was at an airport kiosk and looking for a pair of earplugs in my time to kill. I came across these, and at first balked at the price. ""$100 for a pair of headphones?"" I remember saying. The guy at the counter was quick to point out these are ""In Ear Monitors"", and vastly superior to ""headphones"". I was skeptical, but wanted something to keep the sound of an airplane engine out of my eardrums, and figured I'd treat myself. Boy am I glad I did!

With music playing, I didn't have to hear the stewardesses give their stupid ""put on your seat belt"" speech, wasn't bothered by the babies and children on the flight, didn't really notice the engine except for the vibrations (not at all Shure's fault, I'm the idiot putting my life in the pilot/air company's hands...) and I can honestly say the sound is in a whole other class above what I'd heard before.

I'm by no means an audiophile, but I am a Computer Engineer, and I feel at this point, these babies are no longer the cause of any of my gripes about sound quality. I find myself seeking out lower compression/higher bit-rate music as I'm now listening on something that you can actually hear the difference between the upper-bit-rate mp3's and ""lossless"" audio encodings.

I use them every day in my cubicle at work, and everyone within earshot is so glad I replaced my old, open air Sony wraparounds! No sound gets in or out, so everyone is happy. I've run over 10 miles on a trail with them and they stand up well. I always use the foam tips as opposed to the rubber ones that also come with them, and have ordered a pack of replacement mid sized ones. To me they seem to last about a year before you need new foam tips, which is not bad considering a pack of 6 is about $20 or so.

All in all, can't recommend them enough, and these are the ""entry level"" Shure's. Can't wait till I hit the lottery and can justify getting the $1000 ones! Then again, I'll need to use them in a recording studio or something, because where else are you going to get truly lossless quality sound?"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very difficult time finding in-ear headphones that stay in my ears. I had moderate luck with an earlier model of Shure, as well as Klipsch Image S4 and its descendants. But they were not nearly perfect. Bose SoundTrue Ultra sort of works but falls out if I actually walk around. The tips that come preinstalled on these compress easily and rest comfortably in my ears. They don't require any adjustment after being seated well, even if I walk around for quite a while. Sound is as good as its similarly-priced peers on the market, and they do an excellent job of isolating outside noise.

Update: Accidentally put these through the washing machine, and a few minutes in the dryer, in the pocket of a jacket. They still work fine. I am impressed!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've borrowed these from a friend numerous times and they are very good. The highs are not that clear. I enjoyed listening to a piano or violin piece on the S2 much more just because of that simple fact. The only thing I think they excel in that the Philips lack is the bass. However I do acknowledge that Philips were going for a more ""natural"" sounding IEM. And I didn't particularly like that you have to take the time to prepare the tips and then insert and get the wire over your ear. I understand it's better for running but I just use my IEMs for the train or walking around. I like the traditional insert in with a silicone tip and not really having to go through the hassle. The reason I took the chance to buy the S2 over these was because my friends shure's starting to break up the sound and it's quite common with them. Though be it the problem only occurred after a year. The replaceable wire design seems to be the cause of this sound breaking up (just forum research)."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes for awkward encounters because you really can't hear anything that is going on in the real world when you are wearing these!
I've been wearing them in cafes while I study and don't want to be distracted and I can't hear what is going on around me.
I've been wearing them in the gym on the rowing machine and stay on better than any other ear phone I've ever tried - these are NOT falling out when you work out.

The sound isolation is probably really good for my ears too: because they do such a great job of blocking the sound around me I can keep the volume of my music really low. Used to be I'd have to crank up my music or language tapes when riding the subway, now I keep it at a normal level and I'm probably doing less damage to my ears.

The nylon carrying case is the perfect size too."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first IEMs and I couldn't be happier with them even if I don't have anything else to compare them to. I'm a drummer, and whether it's live applications, or practicing to a metronome or music, these things protect my hearing while blocking out enough sound from my kit so I can hear the audio from the earphones clearly, but not so much as to block out my kit altogether. The bass is perfect in live applications, I can hear my bass drum and bass guitar very clearly. If you plan on using these for regular music/movie listening, mids and highs are very clear as well. It took me a few tries when I got them to put the foam tips in my ears but once I got the hang of it, It's been nothing but a great listening experience ever since and I feel better knowing my hearing is protected with these."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my 8 year old Shure headphones (not sure of model number....it's a predecessor to the SE112). The reason I stuck with Shure is because of quality sound and quality built material. I used my old ones a lot. They got some good banging around as I traveled the world with them, slept with/on them, exercised with them. The EarPods even got small cracks from the abuse...yet, the sound stayed amazing. Never had to change a chord. After 8 years one side finally gave way. Not too sure if it is clogged or just a tired driver (sound is coming through, but barely audible). Decided to upgrade to the 215's. Some say they need some burning-in time....mine came new and great sound was there from the start. Will monitor them and see if burning in makes a difference....but hey...if they sound great from the get-go...how more awesome will they sound if/when they burn-in right?! Reviews I have read complained about these not having enough bass....not true. with the right foam ear-tips they give a good punch! I can also see now, why some people got stares waring them...they really look like a hearing-aid EarPod. If that bothers you, go for the black ones or the Limited edition...Can't go wrong with Shure!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Having lived with a pair of EC-2 IEM's for the past couple years, I was expecting the SE215-CL to sound similar. They don't, unfortunately. These have a much darker sound that is just too BASS heavy for my taste. Like most decent IEM's, the Shure's sound their best when driven from a headphone amplifier with sufficiently low output impedance. I'm writing about the sound of these based on listening to them driven from my cell phone (Nexus 6), which while not is ideal, is a known entity for how my EC-2's sound. Perhaps I will adapt to the sound of these or use EQ to reduce the 60Hz output by 8dB or so, or I may send them back for a refund. Will update this review if I ""warm"" up to their sound characteristics."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for over 2 years now and I felt compelled to write a review now because they just survived a trip through the washing machine and dryer and still work after they came out. I've used them often and they have held up well. They cancel out sound very well. I didn't care for the foam buds myself because when I turn my head the left side comes out a hair and I lose the sound. The same doesn't happen with the other buds. The only thing I've noticed is that after a while the wires near the ear piece have this green discoloration inside. These are absolutely worth the money.

I also had a pair of Shure E2C in ears before this that lasted through several years of constant use. Eventually the plastic around the ears cracked on those which was common with that model. Shure seems to make good products and I wouldn't hesitate to buy their stuff again."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking at the Shure SE215 to use as an In Ear Monitor, on stage with other musicians. When I first got them I ran them at a moderate volume using tracks with particularly deep bass for about 8 hours. I tried them out and my first impression that from the top to the upper midrange it was all there. Nice detail even at higher volumes (Great for live work). The isolation was very good. They seal into the ear more like fitted In Ears than the usual ""stick it in you ear"" type.
I've used them for about 15 hours so far and while the bass is detailed and well defined it really isn't that deep. My hope is that whithin the 20 to 30 hour range the IEM's will begin to lossen up a bit and allow for better low end response.
I own a pair of Future Sonics 500-030 Atrio X in ears and the overall tone is much warmer while still having very good detail. I think they are great for music playback while the SE215's will do a bit better with live music.
I think my next try will be with the Future Sonic Atrio 010-045 w/MG7 Pro Technology. These have been designed for live sound and I have heard a lot of good things about them from other drummers.
I'll give an additional review after the 30 hour mark. Stay tuned...=)"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound excellent right out the box, although im not a huge fan of the foam plugs i took these off and put the rubber ones on and perfect. These are very comfortable to wear. When I had read the reviews before buying them alot of people complained about switching out the tips, they are absoulety right, these are very hard to change I was at work when i changed them out for the first time and had access to a microscope, On the directions it reads to twist and pull, this will probaly break the end off them like other reviews had stated, I on the other hand peeled them off. I stuck my finger nail under it and peel back(I dont have much for nails) and was able to get these off faily easy and change them out. Know for the important thing the sound, I have alot of earphones and one of my prized earphones which is some DENON AHC710 which are $200.00 and thats a very modest price. these might actually sound better not quite yet but the shure are not broke in yet. Everything is balanced so perfectly plenty of bass thats not distorted, the highs are no overbarring and the mids are just right. The only thing Im waiting for is the snap on the low end bass like my denons have and these will be right there with them. I like the cord it seems really strong and the fact that you can disconnect them is cool. All in all very happy with my purchase. I bought these at guitar center and the guy said these sound better then the SE315 and on par with a few exceptions as the SE 535. You cant go wrong. By the way these are being powered bt a ZUNE HD and soon a COWON J3."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Mainly, it doesn't fit well physically. Also, sound is not as good as expected.

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying that i consider myself to be an average lover of music and average earbud user. I usually listen to music or audiobooks with earbuds between 15 and 30 hours a week. I have been through countless Skullcandy, a pair of klipsch s4s, and logitech ue earbuds. Skullcandys earbuds would last me at most 4 months. The logitech and klipsch would last me a little under a year. This is before the earbuds would break, usually because of a cracked housing or broken cord. Please note that i consider myself an average user of earbuds and that i don't abuse or misuse them in anyway. Enter the Shure se215. These earbuds are attractive to me for several reasons. Great sound, much better that any skullcandy or klipsch. Slightly better than logitech. The real standout of these is the detachable cord and the noise isolation. Of course the real reason I am righting this review is because in my opinion these are the most durable earbuds i have ever had. One day i accidentally left these in shirt pocket when i washed a full load of clothes. I DIDNT NOTICE UNTIL THE SHIRT WENT THROUGH THE WASHER AND THE DRYER WITH THE SHURE SE215s INSIDE! Not only did they spend aprox. an hour in the wash but also an equivalent time in the dryer. This is after owning and using them as described earlier for more than two years! Let me tell you i cringed when i plugged them in to give them a listen. To my surprise they worked like a charm, with little to no sound depreciation. By no means would i ever try this again with any pair of headphones. However the shure se215s not only surprised me, but simply amazed me by their build quality and durability. They definitely have earned a returning customer!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2 weeks of use the left ear constantly cuts out. I have a pair of wired se215 as well, so tried the earpieces from there to confirm it was a problem with the cable. Bluetooth connection is ok, but I've had frequent cut-outs out and about in HK when they worked. Sound is great when they work, but disappointed by the quality given the price and brand."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So the $500 SE535s are amazing, if you have that kinda cash to burn on headphones get those, if not, then get these! I just got off a flight with 2 crying babies and even with the music turned down LOW it couldn't hear them or the engine noise on my flight. With my old headphones I had to turn the volume up to dangerous levels to drown out the plane and my fellow passengers - now I keep it on one of the lowest settings b/c i just don't need it.

The foam tips expand to fully fill your ear canal blocking out much background sound before you even plug the phones in. Once you do, though the active isolation kicks in and wipes out more noise (including plane engine). The other nice thing is the snug fit against the outer ear. I can put my head on a pillow and do not even notice that these are in -- this is huge, I mean just try and sleep with a pair of over-ear noise-canceling headphones!!

Compare: The Monster beats by dre in-ear headphones stick way out and the foam does not expand nearly enough.

Did i mention these sound great? They do. Nice base for an in-ear and I was blown away by how much better the music on my old ipod sounded out of the new phones. Again though if you can blow 5x more then get the SE535 b/c that just blew me away - sounded like i was in concert but those were not in my price range.

I've only had these for a day, but so far I am ecstatic."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used 2 pairs of Etymotic ER-6i, and a pair of Etymotic mc5 earbuds in the past.

After using Etymotic earbuds for many years, I've come to expect crystal clear sound from earbuds while at the same time avoiding bass like the plague. The SE215 do provide more bass then I'm used to and less fidelity than the Etymotic.
Are these downsides deal-breakers to me? No. I expected these differences after reading many reviews, especially ones comparing Shure vs. Etymotic. The SE215 sound good enough for what I paid for them.
Unlike the Etymotic models I've used, the construction quality and design of the SE215 seems to be higher. I expect they will work for many years and outlast the Etymotic models I've used.
The silicone eartips do a great job at creating a seal, maybe an even better job than the 3-flanged eartips I used to use with my Etymotics. Unfortunately I believe they have a design flaw, see below.

When I first used the earbuds I thought they sounded like trash, but after a few days of use they sounded good. I'm guessing they need some burn-in time.

I think the silicone ear tips have a design flaw.

If you look at them you should see a line on the surface that would come in contact with your skin/ear. You can see it at this link:
http://tinyurl.com/zhxdzq9
After touching and looking at that line, at first you might think there's no way that line could cause any discomfort. Unfortunately after testing both the medium (this size fits me best) and the large size silicone tips and going through two bouts of ear_pain/skin_infection, I'm certain that line is the cause of my discomfort/pain.
If you use your earbuds on and off and not for long periods of time, I don't think you should experience any discomfort. On the other hand if you wear your earbuds for more than say 6 hours with small breaks (you take them off for less than 10 minutes), that line will have time to cut into your skin/ear and cause it to become tender and/or infected.
I'm guessing that the large silicone tips did not cause me ear pain because while wearing them properly with a seal, the tips are large enough that I don't need to push them deep enough so as to make the line come into contact with my skin/ear.

I'm fairly certain that if the silicone tips were re-engineered to not have that line on their surface, some of those people posting reviews complaining about ear discomfort would change their reviews to be more favorable.

I consider these earbuds to be the best buy for under $100 earbuds category, of course my concern about the silicone eartips stands.
I recommend that if you plan on buying them, to use the foam tips or use 3 flanged ear tips (not included). Use the large 3 flanged tips if the Shure medium silicone tips fit you best.

UPDATE - 8/28/2017

I've been using the large foam tips and haven't had any problems with them. Unfortunately I get cut by the hard plastic that encloses the innards. More specifically the sharp edges found where the two halves meet."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th or 5th pair of Shure earbuds. I've been a nightclub dj for almost 2 decades, so I've been through a LOT of headphones. I don't use earbuds for gigs, but do wear them daily in the office & doing yardwork, exercise, etc.

I originally purchased the Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones in 2010 & the dealer kept having to replace them, due to the cabling cracking where it fits around the ear, causing the sound to go out. They kept phasing out models & sending me the ""latest & greatest"" models, which is how I ended up with these. In all cases, Shure's customer service has been stellar, swapping the previous versions out quickly with no questions asked. I did have to pay for this set, b/c it had been about 8 months out of warranty finally, but they gave me a reduced price on them.

The SE215-CL's sound great so far! As good as any high quality dj phones I've used. Seems the bass is a little chunkier on these & it appears they attempted to remedy the faulty cable issue on my last 4 pair by putting a little rubber casing around the cord & making it detachable, but I still see a lot of reviews citing similar issues as before... at least their customer service has been stellar to date, so if they go out again... I would imagine they'll swap them out no questions asked.

Fingers crossed these last a while!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used the wired version of this headphone for years because of the combination of great sound and sound isolation. I was looking for wireless headphones for a while and couldn't find anything that had that combination. Then I stumbled about these and it was a no-brainer for me. I have had them for a couple of days and love having the same headphones without the wire.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones just arrived today and I was so excited to check them out. I opened the package and began investigating them. The first item you see is a little tutorial slip that tells you it is important to have the right fit for full base and it modeled how to ""easily"" remove the sleeve and replace it with the correct size....ummm...yeah, right! It was the most frustrating experience ever. The sleeve would not come off. I was sure I was going to break them while trying to ""twist and pull"" to remove them.

In the midst of my frustration, I gave up and attempted to put them in my ears to see if the sound was even worth the hassle. Welcome to frustration number 2...no ""left"" or ""right"" labeled on either earbud and they popped out of my ear every time I tried to determine just how they fit and which ear they fit into best. Finally, after what appeared to be WAY TOO MUCH TIME invested, I got them to stay in long enough to plug them in and take them for a spin. AM radio much? I am giving away my age, but that's what it sounded like a tinny old AM radio. I thought, ""And I paid over a hundred bucks for these?""

Just to ensure they sounded terrible, I pulled out my equivalent level Bose headphones and wow, the base in those versus these was an overwhelming difference. I was nearly ready to put these back in the box and send them back when I couldn't resist the temptation to figure out how to get the sleeves off and try again.

The earphones come with a weird little gadget. There's no mention of it's function or purpose in any of the paperwork. I finally decide it must be to get the sleeves off, and I was right. Using this little tool, I was able to pluck one earbud off at a time. Once removed, replacing them with the right fit was easy and I was ready to give my new earbuds for a spin...WOW!

Now, I get it! They sound crisp, clear, and most importantly, cancel out sound like a BOSS! I had them cranked at a comfortable level and was able to turn my in-home Denon stereo up loud enough to feel the bass, but couldn't actually hear the sound.

After a frustrating experience, the earphones were spectacular. If Amazon allowed it, I would have rated this product in 3 areas:

Directions on what is in included and how best to use the product: NEGATIVE STARS
Ease of using the product and/or setting it up for best use: NEGATIVE STAR
Quality of sound and noise cancellation 5+ stars

Expect effort to get them ""right"" for you, but then they're awesome."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using the previous version of these with the short cord and a Shure microphone extension for about three years. Unfortunately, the right earpiece stopped working, so I ordered this one with the replacement microphone and controller for iPhones. The design whereby the cord attaches directly to the earpiece should mean that one will not need to throw away the entire headset when a wire frays. It uses the same replacement inserts as the previous one (good, since I still have a dozen of them), and inserts in the ear the same way, except that it lies flatter. For me, the medium insert cuts out some ambient sound, but I can still hear enough that it is safe to use while walking outside. The sound quality is more than adequate for mp3's and internet streaming (the only things for which I have used them)."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones of this stile. My first pair was the older design where the cable was not replaceable, which I tore when I snagged them while doing yard work. These headphones are great for tuning out the world without ruining your hearing. Since they work much like shooting year plugs you do not have to turn the volume up louder than your surrounding noise in order to hear your music, which in the long run will prevent you from doing damage to your hearing. I wear them while mowing or while traveling on trains or subways and it is like creating a privacy bubble around myself so I can tune out the noisy passengers without being a nuisance since no one can hear my earphones. The sound quality is great as well and they sit well with the wire around my ears. The chord is long enough that I can put my iPhone in my back pocket while wearing the headphones. I would definitely recommend these headphones!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great for casual music listening in loud places and especially while running on the treadmill. I think it's important to point out that these really are designed to be live sound in ear monitors. I'm an audio engineer and must say, these earphones are pretty recognizable for their purpose by their distinctly clear low midrange. They really are versatile though. I first started buying these type of earphones for music because they were the only thing that sounded great and stayed in my ear really well while running. I did own a pair of SE115s but lost them and they don't make those anymore, but these are actually a little better. They have perfect sized drivers so the bass is finally ""normal"". Well as normal as these type of earphones will ever get. Cord noise while running is minimal and is hardly noticed after a few minutes. Great earphones, pick them up if you need something exceptional for active listening or live sound."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND

These IEM's are unbelievable for their price. The sound range is superb with a balanced output of treble, mids, and bass. To those who question whether these have as much bass as ""Beats,"" the short answer is, no. This is not to say they don't have bass though. In fact, they have plenty of it, and to be perfectly honest, more than I was expecting in a single-driver unit.

DESIGN

They look even better in person. I did have to lightly shave down the point where the two halves of the plastic housing meet (as it was scratching the inside of my ear), though this took all of 30 seconds to handle.

FIT/ISOLATION

It may take a little experimenting to find which of the 6 pairs of included tips works best for your ear, but once you do and you create a great seal, holy cow. The outside noise reduction is substantial and you will be able to hear parts of songs that you couldn't before. I wear these roughly 5 hours a day between transit and work and they have become my new favorite pair of earphones to bring with me whenever I'm on the go.

Bottom Line:
Buy them. These should easily be priced in the $150 range (the $200 MSRP is a bit too inflated IMHO, as they encroach upon the next model up's price point). They aren't. So buy them."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need Bluetooth for your SE846, there's no better option. Even if other notice a quality drop, it's still better than off-brand Bluetooth cables. Cable is high quality and when you turn it on it will announce an accurate time of how much charge you have left (big plus)."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for long rides on my motorcycle and they are probably the best motorcycle related purchase I have made to date. Made a thirteen hour ride easy and enjoyable.

Took me a few tries to get them to sit right in my ears and I almost gave up on the. Even the smallest bud is still a little too big for me and I ended up just using the foam plugs as they are easier to mold to the inside of your ear a bit. Once I got them sitting comfortably under my helmet it was well worth it. The cord falls behind your ears and sits out of the way and they do a great job canceling out the wind noise, without the need to turn the volume up terribly high."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones about a year ago because I had heard from a forum that they were good headphones for anyone who likes a lot of bass in their music. Damn they were right. These were easily the best headphones I have ever bought. Outstanding quality with replacable cord so incase the cord gets damaged it is very easy to replace just the cord and not have to purchase entire new headphones. They always stay in my ear when I am working out, and are very comfortable for long periods of time. They are also very isolating with almost no sound leakage. 10/10 excellent product."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a FZ09, so I catch a lot of wind. I also wear an Arai Defiant, which flows a ton of air. I have tried several earbuds but all were ineffective at highway speeds. Today I wore these for the first time and wow. The wind noise was very minimal and I could hear music and GPS instructions st normal volume levels. GREAT PRODUCT SHURE."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones a lot. So much so, that I have now purchased two pairs of them (Lost the first pair in a move).

Great sound isolation, great comfort, great sound. I always tended to break the cord in my headphones, as I use them near-constantly. It always made me nervous about buying a more expensive pair. However, since these have a separate replacement cord that you can purchase, I decided to try these.

I have to say, even with hard use, I have not had any issue with the cords being damaged. The construction of the cords seems to be high quality.

I have one complaint, however. The left earphone occasionally has static/cuts out when I move my head certain directions. I have a really hard time isolating what causes it to happen, and I am not sure how to resolve the issue. I did not have this issue with my first pair. It isn't all the time, but it is just often enough to slightly annoy me, without making me deduct a star because of all of the other positives of these headphones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones based on the rave reviews everyone has written about them. I have always been a Bose man when it came to headphones. The other day, the left ear crapped out on my Bose set (which was only 9 months old). So I decided to find a earphone that would stand the test of time. I am a musician and I have wanted to find a set of earphones that would double as a monitor for my bass guitar. I usually have separate headphones for that but, again, didn't want to spend the money. I've seen artists wear Shure IEMs on stage as an alternative to clunky stage monitors. So I thought I'd give it a shot. Wow. I was absolutely shocked when I first listened to a song on my iPhone. It blew me away. The sound isolation is great and the range is remarkable. I still love my Bose earphones but I may be a Shure man from here on out. The only thing that bothers me is the amount of time it takes to put them in your ears; you can't just pop them in and go...you have to fiddle with it a tad (5 seconds max) to make sure they're in. Then you have to fiddle with the bendable cord behind your hear and make sure it's not hanging out. Also, this does not have a microphone or volume control on the cord...you can buy the cord separately but I don't really mind that much. Also, be careful when changing out the foam/rubber piece, it's a bit tricky to get off."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best earbuds ( or in ear monitors) i have ever owned.For starts, i am but a mere high school student. I've used everything from the Skullcandy Heavy Metals to the Beats by Dre. However, i decided that it was time to stop buying swagged up earphones and get a bit more serious about my music. After several weeks of doing my homework, it came down to a couple of choices.

A.) Klipsch s4i
B. Bose ie2
C.) Etymotic hf5
D. Shure se215

Well, i ended up buying every pair here up until they all eventually failed me, leaving me with nothing but the shure se215. I do not regret purchasing these other earphones as they were all amazing in their own way, however, the pair that eventually worked for me was the shure se215. They are a good mix of all these pairs of earphones and then some. They arent quite as elegant as the etymotics, not quite as comfortable as the bose, and lacking just a little bass when compared to the klipsch. But, this pair is like a jack of all trades with a completely removable cable that never tangles. Unfortunately, they also broke. I was like OH NO, are their no earphones that will never fail me. However, despite the fact that i did not buy them directly from the website, shure gladly replaced my broken buds, free of charge. It seems that perhaps it wasnt the perfect headphones i was searching for, but the perfect company."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earhones, the clear model, about two months ago and within two weeks, the earphone separated from the cable. I was very disappointed because the sound quality is amazing. Every time I wear them, I lament when one will be dislodged without finding a way to prevent recurrence. Another gripe, the cable does not clearly indicate left or right side. Eventually, I will replace them because I know a day will come when the earphone falls off and it is lost. But the sound quality keeps me a fan."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile to the point where I have spent thousands on amps and headphones, but I do have an ear for music. These Shure earphones are not only an upgrade in physical quality but sound and quality as well. Comparing these to the previous generation, the bass has been much improved. As I've read in other reviews the highs do somewhat lack but for $100 high end earphones, you can't expect the very best. I mainly use these as a personal monitor when I play the drums and immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality than my previous set. I was able to hear my bass very clearly and my drums simply sounded much better just by listening to them through my earphones. They fit so naturally and comfortably in my ear they truly are no bother at all. The malleable first couple of inches is great for preventing the cable moving around too much. The removable cable has not caused any sort of issues and I just hope it stays that way. Shure has always made great quality products so I doubt it will be an issue.

If you truly care about the music you listen to, dump those silly Skull Candy earphones and pick up a pair of a real earphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these at Guitar Center in anticipation for needing in-ear monitors for singing on stage, but then that never happened, so I pretty much wasn't using them. I hate for my ears to be completely plugged up just to listen to music.
I figured out a much better use for these and they have become my ear protection for the range. I pop these in, put on some music and get to shooting. I don't understand why anyone would buy these strictly for music listening, but to each their own preference, I guess. These don't sound as good as my Bose in ears and those do not plug up my ear."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these from another website because I had a gift card with them. However, I did want to contribute to the conversation because there aren't many reviews out yet. I had a great experience with the sound quality but the cable stops working after 30 or so minutes of use or randomly. I have to plug it back to USB power source, even for 1 second, to get it to come alive again. Hopefully this is a very limited problem/defect on my device. But just something to look out for. I agree with some of the sound quality comments on other reviews here and won't be repeating that. Not many mention the quality though, I have Jaybird X and cable and construction feels very solid, I can't say that about these. The cable, control box, and even the usb charging cable, all feel very cheap. Because of the issue I have with it dying and the somewhat cheap feel, I will probably just return them and get the wired version."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th pair of SE sound canceling earphones. I have loved them all. My last was the 310. The ability to block outside noise has always been amazing, especially at a loud sporting event. I got the 215Ks a few days ago. I have never had a problem putting the earbuds in my ears, but, this was difficult. I had to watch a YouTube video over and over to try to get it right. I think I have it down now, and, the sound is great. They fit snugly once you figure it out. My biggest concern is that they don't block outside noise like all of the previous ones. The real test will be in a couple of weeks when I go to a sold out College football game with 96,000 screaming fans. If I can still block that out and listen to the radio at the same time, I might go up to 5 stars."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great, but that's what you expect from a company like Shure, so i'm going to skip that part of the review.

The tough thing to get used to is how to put them in. They come with the medium foam ear inserts which were a bit too big for my ears so I switched to the small ones. I LOVE the foam inserts. I squeeze them down to as small as I can get them, put them in my ears, and they expand to fill my ear canal over the next 10-15 seconds. During that time you can feel the rest of the world melt away. It's really incredible how much outside noise these block even when music isn't playing. With music on, the outside world is absolutely gone. I can't hear anyting except the music even on an airplane with someone speaking over the PA. I also use them at the gym and I don't hear anything of the outside world.

They are a little funky to put in, especially the first few times. I've had them for about 3 weeks now and just put them in very quickly and easily.

In short, give them a week to grow on you - you'll be happy."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am by no means an audiophile - but these really don't score well in any category. They arrived damaged (tips were crunched beyond repair), and even after replacing them it does not compare to the competition.

Comfort- The eartips (foam and otherwise) are a nice inclusion, and they fit well and form a near-perfect seal. However, doing so takes about 15-30s. Each pod is way too large to fit snugly in the ear, and they are way too heavy to wear while walking/jogging really anything else (my headphones did better in this category). In order to support the earpods, a moldable wire is attached to each, however I found the wire to be too moldable to really provide any support, while the constant adjustment between each use was a drag. Removing each tip was near impossible, and a definite design flaw.

Sound- These are not overwhelming in the sound department. Bass is flat (not ""balanced"") and creates awkward ""resonant noises"" even at low volumes. Noise isolation is solid with the foam tips, and mediocre with the silicone ones, (although that is to be expected).

Style- These are pretty much the ugliest things you can get. You will look like you have a hearing aid (with the wire running over your ear).

Design- While the ""detachable"" earpods are supposedly a bonus, the weak connection left them falling out all the time. The overall device is made from a cheap plastic, that seemed neither sturdy or durable. The included case was also a downer, as it had no rigid structure to protect the $100 investment. These are by no means ""life proof""... at least not for a person expecting ""ear buds"".

Overall-
These are not great IEMs for real life. Go buy yourself a pair of X10s"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, after using these for extended periods I would be left with unbearable pain in my ears especially the smaller canal. I reduced the size of the inserts to the small to no avail and I eventually accepted that this would be a natural downside of using non-custom IEMs. BUT!… The pain thankfully resolved naturally after about 1.5 months which is certainly a long time… but these duds are worth the wait."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some durable headphones. I used them 2+ hours every day commuting to a from work, walking biking and running. They were yanked on (hard) many times. Had well over 1200 hours of use before they started to flake because the cord was getting frayed. I went to buy a new pair to discover that I could actually just buy a new cord (much cheaper) rather than all new headphones. Now they work again perfectly. Kudos to Shure for the foresight (and environmental friendliness) to make the headphone cord replaceable. I'll never by headphones from another company again. Well done Shure!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these IEM's for about 4 years now, and use them all the time, to this day. Here's my thoughts over the past years of usage:

ACCESSORIES: the SE215's come with a good amount of things in the package. There's small, medium, and large foam (similar to ComPly) tips, as well as small, medium, and large Shure ""olive"" silicone tips. There's an ear cleaning tool, and a rather nice zip-up carrying pouch.

LOOKS: Prepare to explain to people how any why these IEM's are shaped this way, have a cable that disconnects, etc. - people intrigued by how different these are. They're definitely a change of the status quo. I do think the semi-clear casing looks really cool.

BUILD: For being in my backpack or in my ears all day, these have held up great. There's no visible damage, and nothing has broken. One thing I am scared of, though, is the cables breaking. The connection between the earphone and male socket on the cable has become loose over time, and although it is not broken, it feels like it could break at some point. Otherwise the cable is great. None of the logos or lettering have come off. The silicone ear tips have been great, however the ComPly foam tips started breaking down after about a year. That's nothing out of the ordinary, though. The carrying case has not had any issues and it's still my primary form of storage and travel for the IEM's.

COMFORT: Aside from custom-molded IEM's, these easily are the most comfortable I have owned. I've never gotten a headache or any kind of discomfort from wearing these. When the ComPly tips are used, absolutely everything around you is completely blocked out, and the earphones stay put in your ears, no matter how much you shake your head. I generally use the silicone tips, as I like hearing a bit of ambient noise while working out, biking, etc. Make sure to carefully select the right tip size for you, as the wrong size can completely change the sound and can hinder the comfort. I normally run the cable through the back of my shirt and into my pocket so the cable isn't flying around everywhere.

SOUND: I'm no audiophile, but I have had a decent selection of mid-range headphones over the years. For the money, I believe these are some of the better sounding IEM's you can buy. The high range is a bit more prominent than I would like it, but it rolls off before it starts to get ""shrill"". Cymbals and higher notes (like in some electronic music) are decent, but high vocals sound great and flow smoothly. I feel the major lacking area for these earphones is the midrange. The detail is okay, but it is not defined as much as I think it should be. Deeper (male) vocals and string instruments take a backseat to the other sounds, like the bass. Speaking of the bass; it is not overpowering, but the bass dominates the midrange and doesn't have much clarity. For an IEM, it hits well and definitely has power, but I think it can be toned back a bit and made more detailed. I listen to lots of hip-hop and electronics music, and that's definitely where these earphones shine. If you're listening to lots of rock, woodwind instruments, or genres of that nature, you'll probably notice the lack of midrange. It's not terrible, but it's there.

CONCLUSION: If you're looking for a good pair of IEM's that fit well and are very durable, these are definitely for you. If you're solely looking for audio quality, these may not deliver to your expectations, and you'll want to look elsewhere. However, from the standpoint of a complete package, the SE215's are extremely hard to beat. I think they're the best ""all-arounders"" you can get for $100 or less."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off let me say ""audiophiles"" are pretentious idiots. I'm a producer/audio engineer and I read these audiophile reviews and I start laughing. I love the fact that they are engage listeners but really their reviews are more of ego stroking then anything else. Anytime someone tells you they are an audiophile, take their review with a grain of salt because they are really no more knowledgeable then you are. It takes a LOT of training and experience (as in a college degree in psychoacoustics & 20 years of experience)to be able to be able to pick apart sound the way they try to. Personally I've only met a handful of people who were brilliant enough to be able to do that.

All the equipment in the audio chain is going to color the sound and what sounds muddy or distorted on one persons setup might sound crystal clear on another. Everyone's ears are different, no one has perfect hearing. Most people over a certain age lose the ability to hear certain high frequencies, so you have no idea if they will interpret the sound the same way you will. Keep in mind that it's all subjective and you really need to listen for yourself.

That said these are the best in ear monitors (IEM) that I have ever used and I've used some very expensive IEMs. Yes they color the sound just like anything else but they nailed exactly what I like. I love the bass response and on my setup they have a very well defined sound. I'm actually blown away by how much they sound like my Mackie and Genelec studio monitors (which have a more pronounced bass) and I think I can actually work using them (I have never felt that way before). I listened to a couple of my tracks on them and they sounded EXACTLY how they sounded when I made them, this is so crazy to me that it's almost absurd. These $99 IEMs somehow manage to sound as good as my professional studio equipment which cost me thousands of dollars. I'm blown away to say the least.

I would absolutely recommend checking them out and I'd advise you to listen to a variety of music from different sources (CD, MP3, home stereo, iPod, etc) before you make a decision. Don't be surprised if some songs sound terrible on them while others sound better then ever. The reason is the flaws in the production can be way more pronounced because the original artist/engineer might not have been able to hear what you can hear with these. The lesson here is quality doesn't always make for a better listening experience, sometimes the lack of fidelity and a bit of distortion can actually make the music more enjoyable. Which is why its so laughable when audiophiles go on and on about clarity, fidelity and frequency response.

As for the build quality & wire, etc.. it's all top notch.. The ability to replace damaged wires is just excellent and I really think that I'll get my money's worth out of them (even if they die in a year)..

N-Joy"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first saw these shure earphones, I loved the design of them specially the clear ones, but when I started reading the reviews here on Amazon I was disappointed and didn't buy them right away, instead I bought the se215's special edition which come in a nice blue had better reviews and four days after I got them I started experiencing a problem that many reviews have stated which is the left earphone cutting out and I ended up returning them. I was even more disappointed since they didn't work properly, but I decided to buy the regular se215's despite the many bad reviews mainly because I really like the design of them, but instead of buying on Amazon I went to my local guitar center store, they had them for the price and I also bought their pro coverage for 2 years, which covers pretty much anything from physical damage to hardware damage, I ended up paying $120.00 I've had them for a month now and I haven't experienced any problems at all, and I rest assured that if anything happens I can just take them back and get a new pair or get credit for them."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought this last January and here are my thoughts:
*The packaging is good. It may look like it's not durable and it is fragile but actually it is.
*Design is satisfying. The Clear veraion looks more premium. The wire is too long but reasonable that's why I bought an extra cable. The memory wire looks worrying when bended too much. Foam and soft flex tips plus pouch/case are great!
*Sound quality: Very detailed indeed and the bass is really prominent with the thumps but balanced with mids and highs. It sounds very clean and refreshing. I listen to any genre and so far, they satisfy mebeyond expectations. I owned a Shure SeE210 before and I find it to be similar with the sound. It felt like a refinement from the previous product with enhanced bass. It's pleasant to my ears.
*Overall, it's worth the investment."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side works, then doesn't work, then works, doesn't work. Been 3 months. Should have returned earlier. Actually, should have not bought them. Beware. Sound isolation good. Sound quality no better than $20 earphones."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like headphones. More than that i like sound. I'm not an audiophile by any means. I can drop a couple of key words, which i will shamelessly do below. If you're looking for a pair of headphones that sound incredible, albeit for the slight inconvenience of familiarizing yourself with the bendable ear wire, then you should consider these seriously.

Construction:
Strong cords, which are exchangeable in case of damage.
The cord is the most vulnerable part of any headset. Usually people will look after the drivers, but bend the cord in all sorts of interesting positions. Not only are the cords in this item unbelievably strong and comparatively resistant to tangling, they are reinforced at each end where bending would have the most pronounced consequences. They are also long, and exchangeable. In my experience, this is incredibly unusual at this price bracket. It becomes more common with higher end headsets.

The drivers are sturdy and look like they will stand a bit of abuse. If you're feeling like being careful Shure provides a rugged partially soft case composed of what looks and feels like ballistic nylon.

I backpacked for 3 months using these as my only headset and they are still going strong 8 months later without any new parts.

Sound:
incredible. akin to something that would cost at least 3 times as much.
Balanced sound, lacking slightly in the sub bass range. Excellent separation, while still sounding warm. The soundstage is warm and wide, with limits as expected for anything short of <$3-400.
If you like bass enhancement, consider using an EQ. But the composition is pretty good as it is. Can handle a wide of variety of styles with ease - jazz, blues, acapella, and especially tech/min house. If you mainly listen to hip hop and dubstep etc etc that really thrives on the lower bass ranges, these may not suit your style. However, listening to Danny Brown and RTJ right now, and im feeling just fine.

Comfort:
You can wear these for days. Ive fallen asleep in them many times without issue. Shure provides foam and plastic earpieces, with the foam being more comfortable and isolating outside noises so you can enjoy the music undisturbed. Ideal for exercising considering the stability added y the flexible wire. As mentioned previously, not ideal for riding a bike. However, it might be bad idea to wear wearing earbuds while riding a bike anyway.

Style:
Look solid in black. Although they arent the most svelte, and may not suit some peoples preferences. You will, however, garner the respect of anyone that knows what youre wearing and may even be asked out for drink by fellow appreciators.

Overall:
I think these are the best earbuds i have ever owned. If you like the bass attenuation of Beats etc, then please go ahead and buy those. However, if you appreciate nuances of sound and would like to hear songs in a more accurate representation of what the artist intended, then these might serve you better. Horses for courses. I will happily buy another set if mine ever need replacing, or i might take the leap and buy the next model up. For all the getting used to it takes to actually put them on, this minor factor is, for me at least, blown out of the water by absolutely everything else the headphones have to offer.

Disclaimer: Admittedly, i end up using my Sol Airtracks Wireless a bit more, because their bluetooth capability is pretty convenient. The Shure still sounds better though, and i would use them more often if they could keep that quality while providing a bluetooth option. Probably hard with the current Bluetooth protocols though, despite APTx. Good luck with your decision!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you just need a killer pair of earbuds this is a good buy. Unfortunately I didn’t find out until too late that the microphone (or perhaps it’s the microphone placement) is just no good. Everyone I spoken to on the phone has complained about how poor I sound. Again, as for earbuds - they are by far the best I own."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good feeling and sound is amazing. Very smooth with no harsh additions to the original sound source. Very well balanced.
For the first time could really detect the difference between a lossy MP3 recording compared to a FLAC recording of the same music stream. They are very quiet when inserted correctly. The process of putting them on will take some learning to get optimum sound blocking and still be comfortable. If the bass seems light then they are not in correctly. With a good seal to the ear canal the bass is smooth as butter and the high end amazingly clear. The over the ear cords are quite nice. Wish I had these many years ago."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I asked for these for Christmas and Santa was very good to me. I wanted them specifically to use when falling asleep. (My wife likes to fall asleep to the TV - I prefer music.) They are extremely comfortable, especially with the foam pads, and because they fit nicely flush in your ear, they're perfect for my needs. Very good sound quality and noise isolation. Almost too good on the N.I, I.e. if you need to hear the things that go bump in the night, these may not be the best for you.
The cables are very durable and tangle free (so far). The cables are also somewhat rigid as the wrap around your ear which makes them somewhat form-fitting. They do take some practice putting on because the cables rotate freely at the base of the earphone itself. I've found that if you loop the cables over your ears first, it doesn't take much to get them into your ears."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start off, I own both pair of iem ear phones M6 pro and Shure SE 215. However, I bought m6 pro first. Whoever said M6 pro is better than this Se215 are wrong. SE 215 got much much Bass and overall sound stage. I did not burn Se 215 yet but it still sound really good. In the another hand, M6 pro is showing off with the price tag. I bought it at 60$(Now is 40$). In that price, it one of the best iem out there. Why I get another one? It didn't impress me much. I also own beat studio and audio technica m50x . This Shure SE215 is definitely sound better than Beat. Only Beat win in Bass sound. Last of all, if you are on the budget go for M6 pro, it will give you Beat sound without Bass. I would highly recommend Shure SE215."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a gift. They are the best ear buds I've ever owned. Klipsch is the only brand even close. I've tried Beats, Monster, GaGa, Bose, Skull Candy, Harmon Kardon, these sound better than any of those. One thing you truly need a pair of double or triple flanged earbud tips to mitigate the fit. They will be extremely more comfortable with the double or triple flanged tips. Other than that they are sturdy, come with a case, extra tips (single flange), and a removable, replaceable cord like many other high end earbuds. They are AWESOME, and at this price a steal."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the sound while it lasted. I had read reviews about how one of the earpods goes bad. It worked fine for a little over a year until one fine day it just stopped working. One ear went blank. I interchanged the cord to see if it was a cable issue but no, it was the earpod that had just died. I tried numerous revival tricks suggested on the internet but nothing worked. Its very disappointing to purchase something, which isn't cheap, only to find it doesn't last. While many people have had a good experience with these, there are quite a few who have had similar issues. While it lasted, i liked it. Took good care of it and used it as recommended. But i won't recommend something that isn't designed to be more durable, which is a shame really."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The budget SE115 phones utilize a better dynamic driver, in my opinion at least, than the newer SE215. Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE215 (replacement of the SE115) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE115 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality.

The SE215 gets 2 stars for looking cool, but the sound quality is nothing without a good fit. Go with the previous generation shures instead (SE115, SE210, SE310, SE420, and my favorite, the SE530/SE530-PTH/E500-PTH)."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"On my second pair of these in maybe 2 years or so. First pair lasted me pretty damn good. I did kind of mess them up while biking across campus one day, but they still worked really well till I lost them. Enter second pair. Have had them for maybe 4 months at most, pretty much just using them when I’m at the gym, and keeping them in their case. A couple dates ago, the right side started bugging out and loosing sound. It would come back on, but now to the point where it doesn’t work really at all. There is still a little sound through it but nowhere near the other one. Don’t know if I can really recommend these anymore. On to research a new pair."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my NEW 215 clear at a retail store, and after reading so many reviews and comments about this inear phone... I thought I should also give my comments too.

I had 2 SHURE inear phones few years ago, ""E"" series mostly the lower-end ones... those with cables that cannot be detact. They all lasted about 1.5years all with the same problem...damaged cables...resulting in failing on one side of the earphone. I did not get a replacement since it was after the warranty period, but the SHURE customer service was kind enough to explain to me that the damage was due to wear and tear + humidity & constant shifting of the cables at the end of the jacks.

I felt it was a pity that the cable were damaged but the speakers and components on the earphones were still good. But I was not able to afford the highend series of SHURE with detactable cables...years ago; those were expensive.

Now when I saw 215 with detactable cables I was very pleased. An entry level earphones with detactable cables is some thing not seen. This is a cool feature that cannot be found in entry levels. I could change the cables if damage....making it last much more.

The one draw-back I found after I got the 215 is that it really took me a while to wear them. Another issue that I had not thought of....my prescription glasses. The E series had softer cables & without any metal wire in the cable that loop over my ear...so it did not get in the way of my glasses, but the 215 cable (the cable to loop over my ear) have thicker and are wired with a thin piece of bandable metal....this WILL GET IN THE WAY with prescription glasses. So beware!

But I still think that the pros of the 215 out weight the cons. Too bad that I have not realized that about the cables getting in the way of and my glasses, but I have to live with it as I want a inear phone with detactable cable."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just over a year ago I was getting very frustrated with having to buy a new pair of earbuds every few month, as my Skullcandy and other familiar brand ones lasted only a little while. Whether the wire broke, one earbud was quieter than the other, or the cable could barely hold a connection, something always happened with each pair I owned, so I decided it was time for some ""luxury"" ones. I did my research and narrowed it down to these SE215 Shures and the Bose IE2s, both the same price (at the time, now the IE2s are $10 cheaper). What initially enticed me to the Shures was the unique design of the transparent casing, and also the fact that I had never heard of them before. Both seemed like good options, so I began reading reviews. The reviews for the Bose earbuds were generally positive, but for the Shure ones, I noticed extreme opposite opinions. Many claimed they had top quality sound, were comfortable, and were durable; on the other side, there were complaints about how one earbud got quieter or stopped working, and it seemed like a probable issue with buying these. Luckily, the Shures do have a 2 year warranty, and that removed my fear in the breaking headphone issue I have had. Because I was leaving for a long car trip the next week, I really wanted to buy a pair in time for them to arrive before I left, so I went with the SE215s. I could not have been happier with my choice, as they are so comfy, never do they hurt, I have not had one problem with the speakers, and the sound quality is superb (so good that I wouldn't even spend extra on the 315s, 425s, or 535s, although I'm SHURE they are fantastic!) And I still have this whole year to send them back for new ones if they do happen to break. With the 6 different fits and styles of bud inserts, there's bound to be a perfect fit for anyone. I highly recommend these earbuds, and definitely am buying from Shure when/if mine do break! And if you're wondering how they compare to the IE2s, the 215s keep the sound out way better, however both have similar sound quality. Lastly, you can take the earbud off of the wire for whatever reason, but I suggest not doing this as that might be the problem for why many people's Shures are not working. Sorry this is so long but I really want everyone to know how great these SE215s are!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I will begin this review by stating that I am by no means an audiophile nor am I a demanding consumer when it comes to audio equipment. I don't know all of the technical aspects of headphones and I rely greatly on what people are recommending v. me comprehending all of the technical specs of a product. When I was in the market for a pair of headphones I had a few wants:

1) I wanted an in ear anal ear bud form
2) I didn't want full on noise canceling headphones, but I wanted most of the outside noise to be controlled for
3) I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg
4) I wanted them to last

When I received these headphones I was pleased on all fronts with their performance. They sounded great and appeared to be everything I was looking for. However after about 7 months the left ear bud began to crackle and slowly fade in volume. Eventually the left ear bud stopped working altogether. This was extremely disappointing to me as I had enjoyed their performance to date. I ended up receiving another pair as a gift and the results were almost identical. The performance started out great, but until about 6 months into the use of them, the volume in the same left ear bud began to crackle and fade away until it eventually stopped working completely.

I am not sure if I am just unlucky enough to get two bunk pairs or if perhaps I am just losing hearing in my left ear.

Because of the performance (or lack thereof) this non technical audiophile would not recommend this particular pair."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these both on-stage as in-ear monitors, and as my day-to-day earbuds.
The sound is pristine, the bass is great. As monitors, they allow me to hear my voice clearly through a dense mix.
But most importantly... I've used these nearly every day for *five years*, and only had my first problem with them today - the cord has worn out in one spot. Thinking I had to buy a new pair, I came here and realized that the cable itself is replaceable.

I'll probably end up spending the $30 to get the clear cable (makes it mostly invisible on stage), but I could replace them for $15 with a more generic version on Amazon. So that's a $100 product that I use every day, and requires $15 in maintenance every 5 years.

It seems like every piece of electronic gear I have is disposable / dies after a few years. The 215s seem like they'll be working fine after I've died of old age. Can't recommend them highly enough - you're making a purchase that could last a decade, instead of a slightly cheaper pair of earbuds that will fall apart after a year or so."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERVIEW:
I've had my clear 215s for almost two years now and they are perfect. I use them twice a week, every week, and they've never failed me. When I'm not using them I keep them in the case and try to take general, ""common sense"" care not to abuse them. (I don't just shove them in my pocket or throw them in a gig bag and then get mad when they break.) I've also used them for music on long, overnight road trips or on an airplane and they're fantastic. I don't do that often, and I'll explain later, but these earbuds are fantastic, especially at this price point.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE:
As a drummer I need clear, honest bass response, and that's exactly what they give me. Kick drums, low toms, and bass guitars all come through clearly and have the proper sonic definition and differentiation. Cymbals and electric guitars cut through cleanly without being harsh or tinny. Your EQ (or lack thereof) sent to your 215s is exactly what you'll hear.

NOISE CANCELLATION:
Noise cancellation is insane on these. Some may say it's too much cancellation, but as a musician I love it and I think it's completely necessary. I've been playing on stage with someone right next to me shouting in my ear and I couldn't hear a word of it. If my eyes were closed I wouldn't have known they were even there. If you're worried about not hearing the ""ambience"" of the room or feeling too isolated because of the high noise cancellation, have the sound guy patch a room mic into you monitor mix or IEM unit (Avioms, Behringer P16, etc.). You should have a room or crowd mic in your IEMs anyway, but that's another discussion for another day.

EASE OF USE:
Like all good ear buds, these should fit snugly and fully into your ears. The Shure label should face away from your head, and the cable runs out towards the front of your face and over your ear. I use the adjustable slider to keep the excess cable behind my head tight to my skull and out of the way. It will take a couple minutes to figure them out, but once you do you'll be set for the life of the earbuds.I always wear my 215s when I play live and I run the cable UNDER my shirt, against my skin, down my back. It looks cleaner and more professional, and you don't risk somehow snagging the cable on a mic stand or hand rail and ripping them out of your ears unexpectedly. The foam ""bud"" has held up to two straight years of use and an embarrassing amount of ear wax. I'm sure you can order replacement foam but I'm just gross and haven't looked into it.

IEM MONITORING VS. PERSONAL MUSIC USAGE:
I use these on stage as a performer (drummer, singer, guitarist). After 30 minutes or 4 hours of continuous wear they never become uncomfortable. I always keep both ear buds in accept for very infrequent, short amounts of time. Wearing one ear in and one out for an entire song or longer is unhealthy for your ears. (Your brain thinks it can't hear as well, so you'll want to pump more sound into the ""in"" ear. Higher sound levels damage your ears more quickly, even if you're not perceiving them as louder. Again, another discussion for another time.) As a performer who relies on clear IEMs, the 215s are fantastic. If you need dual, triple, or quad driver IEMs, you're gonna need to buy higher level Shures, Westones or 1964 Ears, and also spend 4-8 times as much. For Top 40, rock, jazz, blues, musical theatre, EDM, or anything really, the 215s deliver everything I need, even when I need particularly good bass presence.

If you're primarily looking for earbuds for listening to your phone or MP3 player, be aware that the 215s are designed with performers in mind. There is a lot of noise cancellation going on. If you're going for a run or driving a car, you don't want to block out the entire world. You could be putting yourself in danger by not hearing your surroundings. If you're in the passenger seat and want to ignore everyone else, these are a perfect choice. If you're driving and need to be aware of other cars honking, inclement weather, or that noise you've never had fixed and you've still got 540 miles to go, you may just want to use a cheaper pair of earbuds that don't block out the world around you. (You'll feel better about shoving $20 cheap-os in your pocket than the 215s anyway.)

DURABILITY:
Like I said, I've had mine for nearly two years and they've never let me down in the slightest. When not in use, keep them in the case and not in the bottom of a gig bag under 40 pounds of metal direct boxes. And please, for the love of everything sacred in this world, don't wad them up and shove them in your back pocket and sit on them all day long. That's just the worst thing. Just exercise general care for them and they'll be just fine.

TL;DR:
Even frequency response with good, clear bass. Noise cancellation is excellent for performers, so know that if you primarily need these for personal music listening while needing to be aware of your surroundings. If you take decent care of these, they'll last for a long time. Kind of funny to wear if you're not used to ear buds like this, but after 5 minutes you'll start getting used to it. Perfectly comfortable for extended usage time in one sitting."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a headphone/earbud fiend. I've bought almost every brand of personal earphones from Monster, Sennheiser, Apple, JVC, the like. I use my earphones for my iPhone/iPad/Mac and using in-ear-monitor systems while drumming. When trying to find a pair of earphones, I want to be able to hear a good bass and the mids to not fade into the background. Also, I want some noise isolation. The sound quality is fantastic right out of the box, because usually earphones have a ""breaking in"" time. These little earphones block out almost all outside noise. Usually when I have them in, when people talk to me, I have to take one out to hear them! The earphones' cord is based on a cord used for in-ear-monitors that makes these super comfortable to wear. The earphones are able to come apart from the cord to allow use of a cord made for iPhone (it's got buttons for phone calls) and if the cord breaks, you're not stuck replacing the whole set. Finally, Shure has a great support system if anything goes wrong. Get these earbuds. They're fantastic."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for something like four years now and I couldn't be happier.

The sound is incredible, it handles the bass when i crank it up and the treble always sounds incredibly sharp.

I love the form factor, very unique design and incredibly comfortable. They are the only earbuds I have ever found that I can wear while sleeping. The tips are easily replaceable and the foam ones (my preferred) are incredibly comfortable for extended use and don't get uncomfortable, like many other ones I've used before that hurt after an hour of listening or so.

Also incredibly durable, I have accidentally washed them on more than one occasion and they didn't skip a beat to this day, I'd love to upgrade to the nicer Shure headphones in their line when these give out, but who knows if they ever will!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had these earbuds for about a year and a half. I think they sound great and the wrap-around-the-ear design is great for stability (although annoying at first). One of the main features of these is the replaceable cable. Here's been my experience:
Original earbuds: lasted 145 days
1st replacement cable: 248 days
2nd replacement cable: 253 days
So about 5 months for the original earbuds (a bit crap), followed by over 8 months per cable (fairly good).
I think this is a cost savings mechanism in the long run. Pay for $100 earbuds the first time, then $30 from then on but retain the $100 sound and quality. I'm sticking with them -- great earbuds."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Product. I'm loving it.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to most other in-ear headphones, the Shure SE215K has a significant amount of plastic which rests on the outside of the ear canal. In my experience, these ""appendages"" prevent the silicone rubber component from being positioned deeply enough into the ear canal to manifest much of the bass. As a result, while the clarity is quite good, overall, the sound consistently lacks depth and richness. If I press against them and force them to seat more completely, the sound quality improves significantly. Overall, I am somewhat disappointed and can achieve superior sound with other, less expensive in-ear headphones that I own."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First impression of unboxing these was the great sound isolation on these, which I wasn't expecting. Sound isolation wasn't even a criteria I was looking for when purchasing a new pair of IEMs. I'll go over a few aspects that made me really like these:

Comfort and Fit: I usually have a hard time with IEMs staying in my ears. A lot of models come with the interchangeable pads, but a lot of times they're just three different sizes. I like that these come with three different sizes in two different materials. I found the harder rubber inserts to fit better without slipping and once you get the right fit and seal, it really does make a difference in sound quality.

Lows: The bass really shine with these headphones. I tried several genres of music and each one had great response. Picked up the rich tones in classical, sufficed great with hard rock and, personally, I think sounded best with folk and R&B with a nice laid back sound. Bass wasn't overpowering though and added to the sound rather than created the sound.

Mids: I found this the weakest part of these headphones with some music. Male vocals sound a bit recessed and guitar a little muddled, but I expect this might open up with some burn in. Compared to my Senn HD600 and AKG K240M, these sounded weak, but that's an unfair comparison. For IEMs these still outperformed a lot of other models and I'm still hoping they'll develop a fuller sound. Having my music on shuffle I got Brighteyes Middleman, which started to change my mind on the mids. Strings and vocals sounded great on these, with vocals taking more of frontstage.

Highs: Not too much to comment on the highs yet. Out of the box they sound pretty good. I find the highs to typically be the most fatiguing for my eyes, but I didn't have a problem with this set.

Soundstage: The sound isolation really helps develop a soundstage for these, which is impressive for a set of IEMs. I expected more of an ""in your head"" feel to these but found with classical instruments were well placed. For this I listened to Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor and really enjoyed it.

Couple other pluses for these were the thicker gauge cable, which make these feel much sturdier than comparable models and the unassuming look which blend in, which is positive if you're not trying to draw attention to your valuables.

Overall these seem great and I hope that they get even better with some burn in time."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you love great sound then these headphones are for you. I have the Bose IE2 to compare these to. I thought they would seem awkward due to the way they go behind your ears but theyre not. They are very comfortable. The clarity of the sound is amazing. I had a short in the wire after a couple months. Shure replaces the whole set and had them back to me in less than a week. Great customer service.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been a fan of running with headphones for two reasons: They always fall out of my ears, and running on the streets without full use of hearing seems dangerous. I am always on the look out for headphones that will stay in my ears while running for use on the treadmill or on trails.

I came across this article recommending the Shure SE215 for great sound quality and security in ear. I have always used cheap earphones that you can buy at the gym or Target so I was not familiar with the more high end products like Shure, Etymotic and Klipsch. My friend Lauren owns an audio supply company and gave me some Shure SE215 earphones to try out.

Immediately out of the box you can see and appreciate the quality of these earphones. They have 3 basic parts. 1. Ear foam acts like an earplug and blocks out almost all noise. 2. The driver produces the sound
3. The cord that attaches the driver to your music of choice.

After a 5 mile run the earphones are solidly in place. I never had to adjust them at all. I have found that the key to success with these ear phones is the fit of the earplug part. They come with 6 different sizes to fit any ear canal, so fitting should not be a problem for most people.

3 sizes foam and 3 sizes rubber and 1 tool for cleaning out the driver canal.

The noise isolation is really great with these earphones as well. I have used a pair of Beats Studio headphones and these earphones block an equal amount of ambient noise for 1/3 the price. The SE215 would be great to use on an airplane or anywhere you don't want people to bother you.

With the good sound isolation comes one drawback. They act like earplugs, so you can hear everything in your head. It is impossible to use these earphones while eating, the sound of your own chewing is immense. While running there is also a constant boom boom boom with every footfall, this may be distracting for some, it was easy for me to ignore.

Overall these are some really great earphones and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great sound and good sound isolation. Buy them here:[...]

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for several months now, and I am so pleased. My friend has the top of the line shure ear phones ($500), and I spent a weekend listening to them, and decided that my collection of $5-30 dollar headphones just weren't enough. The shure se215 had just come out and had gotten some glowing reviews, so I took a couple extra tutoring jobs and bought these amazing headphones. You can tell the difference between the se535s and the 215s, but they are surprisingly close in quality, and way better than the bose headphones that a lot of my friends have. The audio is so clear, the sound isolation is fantastic, they are light and comfortable, and with the right music, they are magic. I did have to replace my first set because of a funky wire in the left earphone, but shure was great about getting them to me quickly and for free, they even covered the cost that I had to pay to ship the faulty ones back! Great product. Great service. I am hooked!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome. The sound quality is so clear and crisp, with strong, but not overwhelming bass. These headphones come with a lot of ear bud options in different sizes. The foam tipped ones are like memory foam for your ears and they conform perfectly to you once they are being worn. The soft cable that drapes over your ear can be formed to your ear as well, making these the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn (in ear or over head style). You cannot hear a thing when these are in, as they block all normal sound. I haven't been able to try them out in a louder setting yet, but I bet they would perform very well.

I can't speak to their durability yet as I just got them, but I think these are well worth the money for the quality of sound and comfort alone. If they last a long time and are durable, then they would be priceless. They could easily cost twice as much and be worth the money."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the older Shure SE115s a couple years ago. I loved them, even though the neck slide broke only a few weeks after getting them. Recently, the left bud stopped working, so I replaced them with these. Compared to the 115s, these are a pain to put on and actually hurt my ears--the ears themselves, not the eardrums--to wear, especially because of my glasses. The old design on the 115s was simpler and more streamlined; the 215s are more twisty and complicated, take longer to put and take off, are uncomfortable for long periods of monitoring, hover at times within your ear (creating poorer sound quality), and cannot be used without running the wire up and behind your ear, whereas the 115s could be used this way. You could just stick them in your ears and go, like traditional earbuds. And the sound was always impeccable.
All that said, when the 215s are in well and snug, and not hurting my ear cartilage, they work well. Also, using them while drumming works well because they are very secure in your ear. Lastly, if the wire was to break, the buds are removable so the wire can be replaced.
I should have done more research. I'm sending the 115s to Shure for repair. You should buy from that older line instead; these newfangled deals are too needlessly complicated."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Shure customer for nearly 6 years or so starting with a pair of E3cs. They were astounding and showed me what I was missing using cheaper headphones. After some time, when the warranty ended, I thought it was time to upgrade to the SE 310s. These were also amazing with even more crispness and clarity in sound. The 310s, however, we're not very durable...the rubber casing around the buds eventually came off. Shure sent a replacement and I had the same problem within a year. So, then I saw what Shure did with their new models. The concept of trading out wires instead of replacing the whole pair was amazing to me and became the obvious economical choice.

I honestly was afraid that these would be a downgrade in the sound department compared to what I previously owned, but was I wrong. In a back to back comparison between these and my 310s, I feel that these have an overall better soundscape. The 310s were incredibly crisp on both the mids and highs, but a bit lacking in the bass, not too bad as I primarily is ten to classical music. These, even though a bit less crisp, had a touch more oomph in the bass which results in a much better balanced and rich sound across all genres. These buds particularly excel with electronic music with Royksopp, Animaal Kingdom, and Foster the People as examples.

Overall, these headphones are exactly what I wanted: something a bit more durable than my last two pairs, is a little better suited to make every genre sound great, and has wires that stay put behind my ears. My only beef has to do with the plug unit. My 310s were clearly designed with mobile devices in mind, fitting every case with ease. Why they went back to a traditional, pre-mobile device plug is beyond me and a major headache when it comes to looking for a case for my devices. I had to file away some of my ipad mini case so the plug would fit. This is why I rated it 4-stars. If Shure can fix this with new wires, I'll be a happy man.

Finally, Shure is my go to because of the great experience I've had with warranty claims. Anytime I've had a pair start to deteriorate, Shure has replaced my headphones at no charge and without question. I simply ship my worn out pair with proof of purchase and warranty forms to them and within a couple weeks have a new pair in the mail. The couple times I've called to make a claim, they've been friendly and helpful."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for over a year and a half and the sound is fantastic, unequally by any other earbud in this price range that I've tried (and I've tried a few). However, they do suffer a design flaw. Basically they allow sweat to corrode the gold or otherwise break contact if one uses them in the gym for very long. This WILL happen unless you just happen to not sweat at all, so I wanted to post how I fixed the problem. To fix them, you need to clean and protect the contacts from additional corrosion (yes, Gold DOES develop oxidation under the salty acidic conditions of sweat). Buy a tube of DeoxIT® Liquid contact cleaner and, if you would rather not have to keep cleaning it every year or two, DeoxIT® GOLD Liquid protector. They are sold here for under $10 each for 2ml tubes. Just pull the ear buds off the wires, squeeze or spray the cleaner on both the female socket and male push pin, let it sit for a minute or so, wipe it off, then squeeze or spray on the gold protector on both too, wiping the extra off. Finally snap them back together! Viola! If you used the gold protector, now they won't cut out ever again, but even if you just use the cleaner, they probably won't cut out for many months or even a year.

11/6/2014 UPDATE - I've not had mine cut out now for over a year and a half from a single DeoxIT treatment and I work out with these all the time. Again, just spend the tiny bit of money and get the DeoxIT tubes (or at least just the cleaner). If you do, you'll not have a problem for a very long time."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not bother to write too many reviews, but this product is outstanding. I am an audiophile and enjoy great sound with headphones, speakers and an awesome JL stereo in my car. I am not an expert in earphones. I have purchased many earphones, especially for my 16 hour flights to Seoul, I am amazed at these Sure Earphones, they are amazing. I hear details I have heard in no other format. I do not know how they compare to other brands at this price, but I can tell you they are worth every penny. I am going to save up for some of the higher end Shure earphones just to see what else I am missing."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is decent and they do a great job keeping out noise but considering that the design of these lodges the tips in your ear canal I would expect them to accomplish that. Because of this design I experienced a mild discomfort only 10 minutes in. I even used the smallest tips given. The ear buds are on a swivel which makes popping these in your ears a little difficult. The wire is stiff and extremely long causing these to snag on objects as I walked by. Then only 3 days in the left bud started to give out. Overall a failed experience with these. Will probably go back to using the Bose ie2 or give the senheiser momentums a shot. I can confidently say these aren't for me but may be the ones for you
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried many mmcx bluetooth cables including Shure, OKCSC, NICEHCK HB1, and MEE audio BTX1. So far I like Shure's cable best. I have an Iphone that doesn't support APTX which might of limit me from using the cable from the competitors to its fullest potential. So if you use your cable mainly with iOS devices, this is your stop. The sound quality of NICEHCK sounded best but the Shure didn't fall far behind. MEE cable sounded off to me. I'm no audiophile but I did notice that the whole frequency spectrum was not produced accurately to what my earphone should of sounded like when it is connected via wired cable.

I admit that I was going to returned the Shure's cable at first because the design seems horrible and because there was so much microphonic feedback coming from the wire form cable. One thing I cannot stand is microphonic reminding me that I am moving too much or even breathing for that matters. Fortunately, I have dealt with the se215's wired form cable before. It is not a surgical process but I've successfully removed it from the wired cable a couple years back so this cable was no different. Just a higher risk of screwing up since this wireless cable cost $80 more lol. As expected, the microphonic minimized and non-existent when using the chin slider.

As for the design, I find myself using the chin slider with the battery hiding behind my shirt most of the time. However, when I'm more active and doesn't want it swinging around, I tuck the cable from the left and right ear together behind my neck and use the chin slider to connect them together behind my neck. Now, the battery is hanging close to my neck right around the collar bone. The design of the MEE is the winner in this category because it is more convenient to throw it around the neck or under the chin with minimal effort. The NICEHCK is good but I wouldn't recommend it for active people who move around a lot because the magnetic clasp is fairly weak.

The range on the Shure's cable is as good MEE and NICEHCK. However, the Shure cable managed to one up the rest because of the multipoint connection. The battery is also better than the competitor. I don't listen to music very loud so I was able to get a good 9 to 10 hours before it spams me with the low battery notification. One thing I notice is that sometimes the signal will drop and stutter repeatedly if it is 100% charge or closed to that. I can be resolved by repairing it my Iphone or when the battery discharged to a certain level.

I am currently using Shure's wireless cable with my Pinnacle P1 NOT my se215. The reason for that is because the volume of the se215 is way too loud even when setting it to the lowest volume. Pairing the Shure's wireless cable to the P1 is more tolerable (still too loud) because it has a higher impedance. Specifically 50 ohms compared to 20 ohms of the se215. The hissing background noise is also not noticeable on the P1 but the definitely noticeable on the se215. This is proof that Shure's wireless cable was not made by Shure but it wear Shure's logo and name simply because of $$$. Since most people will pair the Shure's wireless cable to your beloved se215, expect the lowest volume of the wireless cable to be around 3/10 of the volume of the se215 when connected via regular wired cable with the additional background hiss.

There is a lot to love about this cable but I just cannot recommend this cable unless you don't mind the microphonic feedbacks coming from wire form cable around the ear. I hope Shure will give consumers more options as far as design go so that we can choose which design we want instead of a one size fit all as it is never to case in the real world."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my stars! Suddenly I'm hearing sounds I've never heard before, even on songs I've enjoyed for years. I can only compare these to cheaper models. I am not a musician and would not spend $200 on earbuds. I did need to replace the foam tips that came on them (I ruined them taking them off) but the buds come with an assortment of tip sizes. The buds are curved to fit inside your ear and the cord goes up and behind your ear. After a few times wearing, the cord sort of molds to the shape of your ear and the buds are easier to place. The ""up and over the ear"" may take a bit of getting used to, but hey, it's all what you're used to and these are worth getting used to!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rarely write reviews but I had a recent experience with Shure customer service that warrants mention here. I had a 10 year old pair of Shure ear buds. I loved them. after 10 years one side went out, no sound at all. I decided to send them in to repair in hopes they could be fixed because I loved them so much. I fully expected to pay to repair them. Shure just sent me a brand new pair of SE 215s no charge. I know this is probably a small thing to them but they earned a customer for life. Thanks Shure."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been on the search for high quality IEM's for a while now. I have tried: Skullcandy Titans and FMJ's, Monster Turbines, Sennheiser CX 880 and CX 400-II and now the Shure SE 215's. Monster definitely were the best up until these. My normal over ears are my Sennheiser HD 439's. They are not collapsable, so i needed some new buds to match the really great sounds my cans reproduce. Alrighty on to the review :~)

Sound: The clarity of these IEM's are incredible. Each layer is vivid and distinct while perfectly complimenting each other. I like a more ""warm"" sound, thats why I use Sennheisers for over ears. These buds have that same feeling. Very warm without being muddied and sacrifices the Highs. Lows are well defined between mid and sub bass levels. Bass heads will love these buds. Sound signature overall is VERY similar to the Monster Turbines (which are lightyears ahead of the Beats line).

Fit: This is where these IEM's outshine the turbines. Now it takes a little while getting used to the around the ear fit for IEM's (they were my first). You cannot feel them whatsoever once they are in your ears. They run flush in your ear so you can actually sleep in them without feeling pain in the side in my head. You really need to try out all the different tips to get the seal you need to have a great sound from this product. I personally use the large memory foam tips (I have big ears). Once all the above is met, these are by far the most comfortable IEM's I have ever used.

Build: Solid build quality. By far the best feature of this set is detachable cables. IEM's are famous for cord strain failure. I believe its only $15 to replace the cables from Shure's website.

Bottom Line: Get them. AT $100, i dare you to find a better set of IEM's"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought these, I was looking for sound quality above all else; these have certainly delivered. What amazes me the most is the midrange. Both the base and the highs are absolutely wonderful, but the midrange sounds like nothing I'd ever heard before.

When it comes to the fit, I found that they can be a little difficult. However, as long as you actually take the time to try the different eartips and find the best match, everything works out excellently. The foam tips will get the best seal (and hence the best sound), but I found that I couldn't always get a reliable seal; I would often have to fiddle around a bit before they were well settled. That said, the rubber tips (or maybe they're silicone, I'm not sure) will create a seal that is excellent, if just a little under the standard of the foam tips. I use the rubber ones because they're much less of a hassle to get a good seal with. Just pop them in, and you have a reliable, easy seal. During the first few weeks, I found that the rubber created a slightly unpleasant pressure (sometimes almost like the pressure changes one experiences while flying). However, the rubber tips slowly moulded themselves the shape of my ears, and they now fit without any unpleasant pressure. A good friend of mine who uses the foam has told me that they, also, have started to mould to his ears.

I've never really had any problems with the wire stiffness around my ears, after a week or so, they were quite firmly in the best position, and didn't unbend unless forced.

So a few months into my ownership of the Shure SE215-CL, I can honestly say that I have no regrets buying these earphones."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The sound quality may be great, but I am having a tough time getting these things into my ears. I have had two pairs of Shure in-ear-monitors in the past and they were both designed to go up and over the ear but they do not have to be worn that way. I have long hair and I wear them without going up and over the back. I can't really do that with these, so I'm at a loss. And I cannot judge the sound against the previous models either. But I will say that I am smitten by the sound my previous Shure IEMs offer in general, and the sound isolation they provide. I will give these some more chances to wow me."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First earbuds that I've ever purchased that sounded way above and beyond better than anything else that I've ever listened to presently! They sound like a smaller version of an on ear in your ear! Really amazing,just blown away by the sound for the price! I saw these rated in the vast majority of the sites for best earbuds under $100! I said to myself let's buy these and give them a shot,and I'm really glad I did!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215 ($85 shipped from authorized dealer) represents a good value in my mind. These iems have bass, and I think the sound is a little warm overall. The music is cohesive and somewhat natural. It's not the last word on clarity or naturalness or neutrality, but it is very good at this price. Even the bass, which is very good for this price in an inner ear monitor (iem), is not as distinct, fast, proper decay, volume, and frequency as the best headphones - and probably won't satisfy a bass head. Still, sacrifices are made at this price, and the sonic signature suits me. Shure did not fail in any category with the SE215. The SE215 has enough bass to establish rhythm in noisy environments (better than many iems), and vocals are convincing, even if not great. The treble is rolled off too much. The soundstage is mediocre for an iem, bad compared to good open back headphones, and awful compared to great stereo speakers. :-) But I'm very particular. I think this iem is among the leaders of the pack at this price. I think the SE215 provides adequate sound quality for a trip on the commuter train and bus, even though I may want a little better. It certainly is possible that some other iem offers better sound in the apx. $100 category; however, I have heard relatively few iems. Still, my reference headphone system is more than adequate for me to judge the quality of iems.

The SE215 has something else going for it - the ruggedness you expect from Shure. For instance, I tried VSonic GR07 MKii Pro, which were clearly superior sonically - for a month. And then something happened to the Chinese iems and their sound quality dropped clearly below that of the Shure.

The Shure comes with a canvas bag, which I consider useless as I strongly prefer hard cases that resist crushing. The Shure also comes with a small selection of ear tips. None of the provided ear tips really felt very comfortable to me, but I am extremely sensitive to things stuck in my ears. I think I eventually settled for medium-sized black olive foam tips. The housing of the iem is rather large in my ear and if not positioned exactly right will press uncomfortably on the ridge of my outer ear. The cord is not microphonic and has a stiffness near the iems (memory wire), which allow it to form ear hooks behind your ear. They work fine, but I personally prefer separate ear hooks like those provided by VSonic. The memory wire just doesn't seem to fit behind my ear as well and maintain its hook shape.

It offers very good isolation, but not as good as Etymotic Research.

Although there are minuses - lack of quality accessories (ear hooks, comfortable tips for me, hard case), iem housing that's a little big, good sound quality (but not great) - for $85 I'd like to give it 4.5 stars. As I must choose 4 or 5, I'll be generous and give it a 5. Do note that my rating applies to value and is not on an absolute quality scale.

A couple of examples of other headphones that have been well reviewed in this price category include the Meleec CC51 ($80) and HiFiMAN RE400 ($100)."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because my old sennheisers PX200 died on me, and couldn't be happier with the purchase.
Sound quality: probably less detailed than the sennheisers I had. Bass wise these are definitely better, but perhaps too bassy if you like a really flat presentation from your headphones. However, even the top audiophile open headphones couldn't compete with these little guys in a noisy environment.
Isolation: this is the main reason I bought these earphones. I travel by plane quite often and was tired of not being able to listen to many types of music due to the ambient noise. Even the sennheisers I had were not enough for this type of use (though they were great for street use, something I wouldn't recommend the shures for).These cans really shine in this department! I could listen to Ravel's bolero, since the first drum snares! No music will be out of your reach anymore. Also, as the music doesn't have to compete with outside noise, you can keep the volume at very low levels, hence preserving your ears from damage...
Comfort: weird to use at first, and it's frustrating to put these on and then having someone to speak to you so you have to take them out again. Besides that, they sit comfortably in your ears. I've used them non-stop for 4 hours, and could still keep on (on ear headphones tend to put too much pressure over your ears, so they end up hurting). Also, as you can listen to music at lower levels, your ears don't get tired so easily. Also, the fact they are so small and lightweight means you can even drop them in your pocket (try that with the Monsters that are so popular nowadays, or with the noise cancelling phones and their batteries). These come with 6 different types of tips, so you shouldn't have any problem finding the one that best fits your ears.
Construction: seems great, with a kevlar reinforced, removable chord.
Beware: as the noise isolation is so good, I wouldn't recommend these headphones for any situation where you shouldn't completely isolate from the outside world. While you are wearing these little cans, you are, to all effects, completely deaf for the rest of the world.
Overall: great travel headphones. Good sound quality, great construction quality, incredible isolation. Reasonable price for what you get. Highly recommended."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought mine at a local Guitar Center store 4 weeks ago, and the first time I tried it on an Amon Amarth song (Valhalla Awaits Me), I was blown away. The sound quality is quite warm, highs are not stellar but they are great, mids are quite good, bass is deep and isn't muddy. Overall, these are perfect for heavy metal. Other genres? It's still does a decent job.
Tip:
The foam tips will give you emphasized midrange and highs, rubber tips give you deeper and warmer bass."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for use with my motorcycle helmet. They didn't sound as good as a pair of $40 earbuds I got from Sony, but they didn't sound bad. About 4 months in, the cable broke internally at the point at which it connected to my phone. So I had to shell out another $30 for another cable from Shure. They continued to work for about a month, then the right earbud just flat out stopped working for no discernible reason.

These are garbage. They will not last. And while they do work, they're overpriced for the sound quality you get. Never buying from Shure again."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I see lots of reviews calling these headphones or something similar. People saying how they don't work while jogging and such. Evidently these folks don't understand the purpose of these buds.

These are made by Shure. In case you're not familiar, this company makes musical equipment like studio headphones and microphones. They produce the industry standard dynamic mic, the SM58. As a professional musician I own many of their products from microphones to these earbuds. These are intended to be used as personal monitors onstage. They work with a wireless system so a musician can hear his/her voice and instrument in their ears while performing. They are not meant to be used while jogging, driving, working, etc.

Shure is known throughout the world for reliability of their products. I have seen the SM58 run over by a bus and still function flawlessly (I have pictures!). These buds perform well if used as intended. They will take a measure of abuse but anything will fail if misused. It's not the fault of the product but the user.

Just setting the record straight."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to agree that these are far superior to the Dre earbuds being sold by Apple. I want earbuds that will stay comfortably in my ear for long airplane flights. These will. The Dre earbuds start to cause tenderness and irritation after an hour or two.

When I'm on the treadmill these will stay in place and cancel out most of the external noise. The Dre earbuds will start to slip out after awhile and I have to repush them back in every 15 seconds or so. Wish I could get my money back from the Apple store."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound to these headphones are great. The noise reduction is very good as well. The downside is I get a lot of noise on my phones and computers. It seems that it picks up the static noise if you don't have a good or isolated sound card.

Comfort: The housing to the speaker is a little bulky for my ear and it puts a lot of pressure on the external cartilage. It hurts after a while and when I remove them, my ears are very happy to be free of the pain.

I just replaced Bose IE headphones with these shure se215. The sound is worth it, but the comfort and noise are giving me some buyers regret. Bose were the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned, although quality and durability were middle of the road. SE215's heavy and detachable cord make this better for me durability wise because I will use them everyday (unless they are just too uncomfortable to do so). We will see......."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones (I bought 'em twice!) but with the one (kinda serious) caveat that the cables are garbage and inevitably fail after a year or so if they aren't already trash when you get them. I've probably ordered 5 or 6 of just the cables to replace ones that fell apart or came faulty. Thankfully they're replaceable but not cheap enough ($20+) where it's a negligible cost when it happens.

I also highly recommend the blue bass-edition from japan. Super bassy, amazingly clear."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the 100% best earbuds for the money. They are high quality, high performance and well worth it. The first pair I bought, I was like ""What kind of idiot pays $100 For earbuds?"" Well, they are worth it. If you love your music and full bass? Make the investment. I almost bought the SE315s. But, I figured close to $200 when the $100 pair blew my mind was a bit extravagant. One day I may splurge for the 315s. But, Shure SURE knows what the hell they're doing with earbuds."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I compared these headphones to the Shure SE535 headphones ($500) just to see what I was missing by buying the $100 single driver version.
There are two major difference that jumped out at me.
First the $100 SE215s have a much fuller/thumpier bass. I happen to like it, but it does sound less accurate than the $500 SE535. (I should say that I am not doing critical mixing or stage monitoring with these, just casual listening, so for that a little extra bass is nice).
Number two, there is a definite scoop on the SE215 in what I would call the mid-mids (maybe leaking slightly into the mid-highs). In this range the SE215s loose some definition and feel a little thin. I noticed this before doing my comparison and it was proven out when I listened to the SE535s.

While these are noticeable traits and less than perfect, I don't think I'll ever feel bad about spending $100 for the SE215s. They have great isolation, great fit for me, and very enjoyable sound."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a heavy user of my IEM's. After going through 2 pairs of Klipsch S4's I decided to try out an IEM which came with a detachable cable. I'm happy to say that after over 2 years of using these earphones daily (and treating them quite roughly) they're still my daily driver. Although I've had to go through 3 pairs of cables (2 stock, 1 third party), the drivers themselves are doing just fine with no sign of wear other than the Shure text fading off.

I won't comment too much on the sound, since there are more qualified reviewers to do so. I will say that they do deliver as expected at this price range, and the noise-isolation and bass quality is great. Don't hesitate to buy!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received these as a gift from my late uncle who was a complete audiophile at the time circa 2012. The lows and mids these are able to produce is astounding and I used these daily for years until they were stolen. I'm looking forward to purchasing another pair now that I see the price has come down quit a bit over the past years.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the nicest earphones in terms of sound quality, durability, and for blocking outside noise. These are perfect for any situation where you don't want or need to hear anything outside your music. Great for airplanes, long car rides, loud public places, studying, etc. I'll even use them to fall asleep when my roommates are still partying or being loud when I'm going to bed. When exercising, you can wear them pointed up and have the cord wrap over and around the backside of the ear for a more secure fit. I like to use the foam tips: they're like the earplugs that you squeeze and put in your ears, and then they expand to the shape of your ear canal and block outside noise.

As a company, Shure supply's almost every big name musician and performer at large large venue shows with both their high quality earphones and microphone equipment. They far exceed every other brand in terms of sound quality produced. For noise blocking earphones on a $100 budget, there's no reason to get anything other than the SE215's. They'll even replace them for free if you keep a receipt, and they've done this for me and other people I know with their earphones that have broken long after a 2-year period. I had the first generation model for a while and the cord malfunctioned and they upgraded me to the newer model at no cost.

With this current model they've deigned the earphones so that the cord detaches from the buds at the base of your ear, so that if and when the cord breaks, you don't need to go buy a whole new pair, just replace the cord. This is also great for if and when you want to upgrade to their higher end models like the SE315, SE425, and SE535 (each higher number is about $100 more than the previous) because the cord works for all of the current SE series earphones. Just swap out the buds on the same cord. Once you try any model of Shure's earphones, you will never want to buy another company's earphones. They come with a few styles of different tips, each in small, medium, and large, and their carrying case is quite nice. Ask anyone you know with Shure earphones and they will gladly tell how how awesome the earphones are. 10/10"

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several models of Shure in ear monitors for over 5 years. They've been used on-stage ,on the job, yard work, out in the garage, long drives to engagements and every other space where I need to block out the noise. They are an introvert's best friend. They are so reliable, I've replaced the cables multiple times for the same drivers. Right now, I'm wearing an inferior set of UEs I was forced to dig out of the junk drawer. Seems we were an hour late feeding our cat Jasper the other night. When we arrived home, dismembered pieces of my last pair of SE215s were scattered all over the kitchen carpet. Jasper knows all too well what must be done to ensure that the sacred hour of supper is never again forgotten. Absolutely nothing was salvagable even biting the nips off the drivers... he is thorough. No worries, Jasper is fine and loved, but from the distance, I suspect he realizes he went a bit too far. Seriously, highly recommended, only the most discerning audiophile will be able to differntiate the single from multiple drivers. At this price point, the build and sound quality is hard to beat. Given the foam inserts are going to absorb your best funk, keep them away from pets."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used Seinheiser CX300 (around $70) for 3 years and then one channel stopped working I bought this entry level Shure.

Sound is good for $100 earphones but it gives inconvenient feeling in the ear channel, over the ear cable wear makes the phones hard to install. (it is not really hard, bur require additional effort comparing to CX300 where installation was done in one single move with one hand)
Wires are extremely non flexible and thick.
The 3.5 jack is extremely thick and will not fit to iphone 4 bumper phones hole

I use it for 2 weeks already and trying to get used to it, but still feel pain in the ear channel after long wear (i tried several soft and rubber cushions already).

after 2 years i love it - tried to replace - no chance for ie2 or westone1... and i'm changing its to 5 star."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these earbuds approximately one month now, and I couldn't be more satisfied. When looking to purchase earbuds, I did a ton of research and ended up choosing these. I am not an audiophile, but I do care a great deal about sound quality. I wanted a headphone with realistic sound, a head phone that allowed me to pick up on every detail of the music. To me, these do just that.

The musical versatility is great as well. I can go from listening to jazz or Western art music, where the sound is very clear and each instrument is easily heard, to dropping a ton of bass with some dubstep. I really like how these earbuds do not over-exaggerate the bass. Have you tried listening to Beethoven with Beats headphones? It's awful. Their desire to blow your skull up with bass only make listening to certain genres of music enjoyable. The bass the Shure SE215 earbuds make is true to the music; if the music has a lot of bass, these headphones will provide some head thumping lows. If the music doesn't have a lot of bass, these headphones will make the music sound lively with great mid and high tones.

I would not recommend getting these earbuds for use with activities, such as weight lifting, running or sports. They block out so much noise that you only hear the music playing. This can make these activities dangerous. It is impossible to have a conversation with someone while these are in.

TL;DR Version...

THE GOOD:
-Great, realistic sound
-Deep, head bumping bass when appropriate
-Noise isolating
-Quality feel
-Thick cable that is replaceable
-Traveling case included

THE BAD:
-Headphones are inconvenient for short use (they have to set, you can't just stick them strait in your ear like normal earbuds)
-The cable is hard for a few inches below the earbud connection, making the cable get caught easily while moving with these
-Headphones are not suitable for physical activities due to noise isolation

I would highly recommend these earbuds. They are a great way to escape the noisy world and enjoy your music on a whole other level."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just want to start with saying that while these In-ear-monitors (IEM) will function as regular headphones with phenomenal sound, be aware of what you are buying...these are not IEMs designed for runners, bikers, or for anyone really where noise cancellation is dangerous, they are designed to be used as IEMs for performers where external noise can be distracting or cause you to lose important information that you need to be hearing...

I myself am a bass player and I need IEMs that will stay in my ear, provide great low-end, and have extreme clarity, and these are absolutely perfect for me. These things sound phenomenal, are rugged enough to withstand a fair bit of abuse that comes with playing live music (I myself am a fairly animated musician), and they stay in your ear. The sound isolating is fantastic...the mix stays in my ears without all of the distraction and muddiness of the live audio blasting and reverberating throughout the room dirtying up the sound.

For any musician who is running IEMs and doesn't want to spend a fortune of higher end IEMs from companies like Alien Ears, Westone, etc., the Shure SE215 does a stellar job for a great price. I would never recommend trying to get by with standard headphones, while they get the job done they don't do the job near as well as these IEMs. Again, just be aware that these are not designed to function like your standard earbuds and may not the best option for runners, bikers etc."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in love with my prior SE535 which developed cable issues. The SE535 had a good fit, fantastic sound, but couldn't justifiably shell out $400 for another pair, so was pretty chuffed to see the similarly-shaped SE215 come along at $100 and with a detachable cable. The sound was good (not SE535 quality of course) however the swivel on the cable makes them slightly more difficult to get the memory of the cable right making the fit more difficult. This possibly lead to the cable breaking earlier -- it's broken in two places within a year. The detachment mechanism has become bent so won't be able to replace the cable after all.

If you truly want to get rid of cable issues, I believe wireless is the way to go."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome IEMs. I can't speak of them highly enough. Other reviewers have already written about its qualities, so I won't go over that. I'd just to add that I bought these and Shure's SE315 to decide which ones I'd like most. To my ears, there is no comparison. The SE315 has a much more flat, boring, cold, sound... So ""analytical"" that it makes the songs sound weird, really different from their original mix. The SE215 on the other hand have plenty of bass, slightly recessed mids (not to the point of shadowing vocals, actually rock vocals sound great on these), and present, perfect, controlled highs, not fatiguing at all. I have tried like 15 IMEs to date, some cheaper, some more expensive, but these are hands down my favorites (followed close by JVC’s HA-FX T90). Once you get used to the over-the-ear cable thing of these, I must say they are really comfortable. And be sure (pardon my quibble) to use Shure's olives ear tips, they are absolutely the best, better even than Comply's."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the absolute best generic in-ear headphones you can buy for less than $1,000.

I'm a touring professional monitor engineer (which means I wear these for my job, mixing in-ear monitors for musicians on stage), and my primary set of in-ear monitors are custom molded JH Audio JH13's. They have 6 drivers in each ear (2 for lows, 2 for mids, 2 for highs)...12 drivers total. They sound great and they cost $1,100. I can honestly say that in a blind listening test, I think the Shure SE215's could beat my JH in-ears. I always keep a pair of these with me and sometimes I prefer using them over my custom JH13 in-ears.

The other major companies that make professional in-ear monitors are Ultimate Ears, Westone, Sensaphonics, and Sennheiser...There are a ton of other companies that make in-ears, but are mostly aimed at the consumer market and not the professional audio market. I can tell you that the pro audio products are way better quality and value than the consumer brands. You may have tried Beats and Bose and every other colorful trendy brand, but those are nowhere CLOSE (Beats is the worst) the the sound quality of a true pair of professional in-ear headphones. Read the other positive reviews to hear how people describe the sound of these. I mainly wanted to write a review from a professional sound engineer's perspective to validate some of the claims other people are making.

There was a ""shootout"" at NAMM within the last couple years with all the top in-ear companies and these won 2nd place in a blind listening test. That's competing with ALL models up to the $2000 range. These are $100. That's just unbelievable.

There's a review here by Steve Oz that mentions you've got to use these for a few weeks before they really get broken in, and he may have a point. I've only used pairs that have already been broken in, so I don't think I've heard a pair right out of the box. Makes sense though.

One note about the (few) bad reviews. It seems all the people giving these 1 star have said that they *keep* breaking even when they are replaced. I would attribute that to user error. Either overdriving the headphones (listening to loudly) for extended periods of time, getting them wet with too much sweat, not coiling the cable properly when storing, or generally being too rough with them. These will last a long time if you use them properly and you don't blast your eardrums. I have artists that use these exact in-ears every night (while sweating and dancing around) for 2-3 hours at a time and they last for 1-2 years without issues (which is longer than a lot of other more expensive brands). The only artists that end up ""breaking"" these and having to send them in for repairs are the guys that crank their in-ear packs up way too loud :)

If these do not blow you away, there is something wrong with the pair you got or something is wrong with your head. First try another pair. If that doesn't work, try another head.

Happy listening :)"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't have enough experience with audio equipment to properly rate these, but coming from the 115s, I find these to be pretty similar - can't hear too much difference even when compared side by side. The different earpiece design however takes a bit of getting used to, though the over-the-ear tubing helps keep them in place (increases tangling though). I do miss the two part cable that the S115s had - made it easier to untangle the cable at times and easier to put on while wearing a shoulder bag. Finding the S115s on sale for $60 is worth waiting for when these are more than 2x that for hardly noticeable increase in quality."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these almost every weekend. Great isolation on noisy stages. There's a little bit lacking on the bass frequency response, but good clarity. Detachable/replaceable cable is a huge bonus as I often get opens/shorts in almost all of my headphones. I would probably want different inserts for everyday listening, but the foam ones are great for performances."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace 8 year-old Shure E2c's, and I've now had them for about a year. Despite sounding amazing, I'm ultimately not able to use them as often as I'd like due to two major flaws. Without these flaws they would be 5 stars like my E2c's. With them they're only 3 stars.

Here's a list of the pros and cons from my experience.

Pros
-As with the E2c's, the SE215's produce beautiful, balanced sound (if you're looking for unnatural bass look elsewhere).
-The silicone sleeves work just as well as the foam ones, but don't require that you hurriedly squish the foam and jam them in your ears in order to get a good fit.
-They stay in place even when moving vigorously.
-The cord is the perfect length for me.
-The sound isolation is exceptional.

Cons
-The plug is very large (1cm diameter), and I have to take the bumper off of my phone in order to use these headphones.
*The right headphone went dead at about 9 months which Sure replaced under warranty. The replacement process took 3 weeks.
*The killer for me, though, is the deafening ""booming"" I hear whenever I take a step with these in. Going for a walk as I try to listen to a podcast is basically the podcast competing with the ""BOOM-BOOM-BOOM"" as my feet strike the ground, and that's with foam-soled running shoes on! To get an idea of what this is like, stick your fingers in your ears and go for a walk. It's nearly that bad.

The bottom line: if you're looking for a set of headphones that you can wear at your desk, then these are great. Just don't exercise in them, and make sure you have a backup pair for when you need to have warranty work done!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones rock!. I have had them about 3 years and the sound is incredible. I have about 10 acres I have to mow every week in the hot Florida sun and use these on my riding mower. They are above average in sound and durability. The earphone drivers can even be removed to replace the heavy duty kevlar cord (I have never had to replace it) which can be purchased separately. One bit of advice: When I first purchased these I used them a few times and then set them aside because I could not figure out how to make them comfortably fit in my ear. I read a review about a year later that had the same issue but encouraged the user not to give up but to persist until you figured out how to put them in your ears just right. I dug them out and gave them another shot and he was right. Once you figure out the angle and the side (they are side specific) to put in they do great and fit well. They will not fall out. The over the ear stiffer part of the cord allows you to mold it over the top of your ear to help hold the earphone perfectly in place. (Hint: Focus on getting the earphone at the right angle in your ear before you pay any attention to the over the ear wire. That part actually swivels on the earphone so it can be adjusted where needed after the earphone is place in the ear at the perfect angle for your ear.) I recently misplaced my SE215's and have been using an assortment of different earphones. From bluetooth to over the ear phones. They all sound cheap and tinny compared to my SE215's. I am biting the bullet and ordering another pair today. Do the work until you figure out how to get them in your ear just right and you will fall in love with them.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily the best headphones $100 can buy. I've had many different higher end ear buds over the years (Klipsch, Monster) and in my opinion these rival competitor headphones that cost twice as much. They're comfortable, extremely sound isolating, sound fantastic, and due to their over the ear wire design stay put even while running. I honestly have heard parts of songs that I've listening to for years that I've never heard before.

Top all this off with the ability to replace the cord which always seems to be the failure point of all headphones? No one else offers that.

To my ear they do seem to have a break-in period, so give them a week or so of regular use before you make any knee-jerk decisions."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good, I bought these at guitar center a few days ago for 108 because I needed a nice pair of headphones that could I guess just make me go into a ""happy place"". The sound is amazing and I love the foam tips, I primarily listen to rap/ hip-hop and these headphones are perfect for bass while still keeping vocals clear. The noise cancellation is also amazing, I used these on half volume while mowing my lawn and I couldn't even hear the mower which came as a big surprise to me. So far these headphones are amazing in every aspect, but keep in mind I have only had these for a few days so if anything happens I will edit my review."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I read the comments it made me a bit skeptical of getting them but some comments made me want them. I've been looking for good earphones because personally I prefer headphones. But let me tell you personally, these earphones are one of a kind, they may be a little difficult to get in your ear at first but once you do you'll know the feeling of accomplishment. So if your feeling like backing out and not getting these don't, they are worth the money. (blocks all sound and when turned all the way up no one can hear your music so they won't be annoyed, trust me their pretty loud with good bass)"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these as in-ears at church, and they were great when they worked. Unfortunately after a few months the left ear started having some kind of connectivity issue and constantly cuts out. This really messes with my overall mix, especially being in a drumcage where I count on having the front of house sound in my ears to dial in a mix"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got them as a gift from my wife. In less than eight months, they stopped working, unless you count being able to hear only through one side, which I do not. When they were working, the sound was good, but the one star is for the horrible value. To spend that kind of money for such a brief lifespan is a really bad idea. These are remarkably fragile."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not fully compatible with SE846. This cable is actually a downgrade for them, it does not provide the same quality sound as the cable does. Unfortunately shure has to improve this cable.

Also it will be a nice warning in the box or in the specs to say that it is not fully compatible with SE846"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these, I used the memory-foam-type ear tips and was really disappointed with the results. Extremely bass-y and muffled (to my taste), making Pink Floyd's The Wall almost unlistenable. But when I used the included soft-rubber flange-y ear tips, it was 100% better. Generally well-balanced; perhaps a little less high-end shimmer than my previous Etymotics ER6s, but better bass, more solid construction, and better fit.

Regarding the latter, I am one of those who likes to listen to music as I'm going to sleep, and fortunately, these work pretty well in that regard - they're comfortable enough and low-profile enough that you can lie on your side on a pillow with them in and they are comfortable enough to fall asleep with. Not perfect- still just a _little_ too stick-y out-y, but better than any of the many other earbuds I've tried, including ones that I had Ultimate-Ears-style ear molds made for.

For working out, they're a little fussy to get in, but once in, they stay in very well. As others have noted, the wires go up, around and behind your ears; doesn't bother me, but I suppose YMMV.

Anyway, four stars, since I think the sound (especially the high end) could be a little cleaner (but then, that's why Shure makes higher-end earbuds, right?), but solid, comfortable and durable. I'm pleased."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's amazing how they sound !
It's a bit difficult to put then right on your ear on in a first time, but it a few times of using, you get the way.
Without listening nothing, they already isolate sound. But man .. when you start to listen to some music, it's amazing ! I'm a very eclectic man, so when i listen to jazz or blues, you can hear every detail on the music, you'll fell the difference, if you like these kinds of music. But when you are listen to music who has a lot of bass, they do the work verily well !
I cannot wait to get money to try the other version, like the SE315 and SE425. You'll not regret the acquisition!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cable failed after three months, so the left channel cuts out intermittently, and Shure isn’t willing to mail a replacement cable so a friend can bring it to me overseas. That’s after TWO WEEKS of them dragging their feet on making contact with a local repair center in Europe. DO NOT BUY these if you’re planning on traveling with them or even moving around. They look well built, and they sound great, but they’re delicate and apparently can’t handle use while walking around. Not to mention Shure’s bad rep for customer service (hopefully if you purchase through Amazon, they’ll take care of you better than Shure does for customers who bought elsewhere.)"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a set of Shure se215 from a local shop because of all the great reviews and was a bit disappointed. They're comfortable to wear then around 30min of wear they begin to hurt my antitrigus because thats where the earphones sit. They do block out alot of ambient noise which helps the sonics of the music. They have a warm sound signature with an emphises in the lower rigesters.
The cable can be problematic because of it's design. The cable swivels at the earphones connection and this will occasionally cut out the sound when the earphones are not anchored into the ear properly or from continuous movement.
A better buy for less money would be NarMoo's B2M set which eclipses Shures sound in almost every respect."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty mediocre - cord is too long , ends up taking space in the pocket and tangles sometimes. Sound is nothing special , better than generic $25 apple headphones but nothing to rave about. Lack of microphone and mute button is inconvenient. They do stay in place while running - that's a plus. Noise isolation is ok."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,These have good sound quality but I don't like how it hurts my ears. After an hour the plastic at the top where it wraps around the ear would start making the back of my ear feel sore. I have to take off the earbuds for a bit to relieve the pain. Clearly these are not meant for listening to music for a long period of time.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few years ago I really started listening to music and then a ton. (Prob 3-5 hrs a week now). I started off with crappy standard iPod earbuds. Then I jumped around the low-end cheap skullcandy ink'd several times where they would break usually a month or so. Getting really frustrated, I got the motivation to actually spend some money. Researched for a while and waited a week cause these earbuds were back ordered. Now having them for a month, I love them. Great fit(it comes with a good package of different sizes and materials of parts that will fit anyone's ear), they also don't protrude out of you ear so you can sleep comfortably on your side, the bass is nice, sound cancel very well, the music is clear even when the volume is loud and quiet, the cord is thick, dependable, and doesn't tangle easy, the jack is nice and everything on the SHURE SE-215 is sturdy and well designed. The around the ear chord style though a little difficult to figure out at first is great so the earbuds don't fall out easy. Great price for these earbuds and I'd happily pay a lot more than $100."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear highs, steady mids, deep lows. Wearing them was the biggest issue I had initially however once you get the idea of how they are supposed to go in your ear it is cake. Just look at a picture online if you're having issues. I also go by the logo on the side of the monitor it should always be readable to someone looking at it. Comes with a wide variety of tips however the memory foam ones that are preinstalled are far superior to the others so I put them back on. 5 stars will buy again if i happen to smash these in my day to day. Only reason I wouldn't get these is if I had some extra cash and decided get an upgrade to something custom molded to my ear canal."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome! They sound good, clarity is good, bass is ok, if you want more bass buy the better SE earbuds...but for $90-100, it cant be beat. It does deaden a lot of outside noise as well. I let my singer try them when I got em, he popped them in and sang 2 words, immediately stopped, said ""Wow, holy $***"", jumped to amazon.com and asked ""What ones are those? Im getting them now!""
We run them thru a Behringer 4ch headphone amp and run 1/8"" ext cords along with guitar cables...wtf, your tethered anyway...and they work perfect!
So for those of you on the fence about IEMs vs monitors, quit being a wuss and climb over, the grass IS greener on the other side!!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have the Shure e2c... these are much better sounding for the same price, and seem more durable.
Sound isolation is superb. (so don't use these while jogging)
I had the klipsch s4, which were pure garbage in every way (reliability, sound) compared to the se215.
Shure has gotten it right. If you have $99 in your budget for in-ears, get these, you won't regret it."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many different sets of headphones. I have a soft spot for Shures. I've owned a couple pairs of the 100 series buds and a set of the 300 series. These are my favorite.

I got em at an Inmotion at the airport for $81 so not a bad price. For less than $100 there is really not a better option for quality."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these earphones for almost a year now and they sound just as good as the day I got them. The quality that Shure puts into these earphones is amazing, the material that they used on the wire feels almost like a braided cable. The cable has not shown any wear and tear over the time that I have owned them. The sound quality is very good, if you like a clean studio-like sound quality with just the right amount of warmth to them, these earphones are the best buy for your money."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The plastic around the jack is too fat for use with a Nexus 4 that has a bumper on it. I'm really disappointed about that because I loved my Shure SE110 headset, and I was looking forward to this replacement. I'm returning these because they are useless with my current phone."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums in a completely enclosed drum booth. Needless to say, I needed a product that would not let on any sound. These are a great set of phones that do not allow any of the exterior drum and cymbal noise to cut into my monitor mix.

It's a little odd to wear this style of headphones ( over the ear style) at first. I find that if I run the cord down my back, this makes the cord run in a more natural style (as opposed to running the cord down your chest).

All in all, it's a great product. The one minor complaint is that over time (about 2-3 years) there seems to be an issue with one of the ears cutting in and out. This only happens when the phones are in a very specific position and the cut out is very short.

Great product and I will defiantly buy this brand again."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of these headphones that I am purchasing as my first pair is starting to cut in and out but they lasted 4 years of heavy use in the gym, deployments, and many plane flights. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!!! The sound quality is well worth the difficulty of adjusting them to your personal comfort as they are a little tricky to get fitted properly, took me a few days of use to get them fitting perfectly but its well worth it. I am excited for the next 4 years of sound bliss."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT: I ended up returning them because the inferior wireless tech just doesn't sound good enough to justify the price of the cable.

I will update this review if any problems come up, but so far these work beautifully. They do not support aptX, but most people won't notice the difference. I pulled off the se215 IEMs and am currently listening to my se846s through the Bluetooth cable. It has good range. I have not used them long enough to confirm the battery life, but at least they did come mostly charged."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound quality for the price. The bass response is very good. I was looking for headphones that are warm but these might be a little too warm for me. I would like a little more high end but that is my only complaint.

They also have very good sound isolation when you use the foam tips. Listening to good quality sound without outside sounds interfering is awesome. You can get very immersed in the music with these. However these tips need to be squished, like you would ear plugs, prior to being put in the ear which requires two hands and is irritating if you tend to take your earphones in and out all day.

I find these uncomfortable to wear. The few inches of the wire from where they plug into the ear buds is supposed to have ""memory"" so that you can shape it around the ear. I find that it doesn't have enough memory and I'm constantly fighting to keep the wires around my ear. They tend to loose shape, pop up and fall from my ear. Having the wires just hang directly is not an option because they are too heavy and will pull the buds out of my ear. The design would be greatly improved with a more solid rubber or plastic piece to go behind the ears.

My first impression was that they are very durable. The wires are thick and seem much more robust than your average headphone wires. The plastic of the buds also feels very solid and well constructed. I have a feeling you could step on these and they wouldn't break. I assumed they would last me for years. Six months after buying them, sound started to crackle and cut with movement. The insulation around the part of the wire just before the jack completely cracked and caused this issue with the sound and rendered the headphones unusable unless I plan not to move while listening. Because the wires unplug from the buds, I might be able to buy replacement wires but I haven't looked into it because they were so inconvenient to use I'm not interested in using them anyway.

For me, earbuds are for mobile, on the go use and should be durable. I thought these would fit the bill but they let me down. They are also inconvenient and uncomfortable, especially if you need to take them out and put them in frequently. Because of these factors, I will never purchase another pair again, despite the great sound quality."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll just start this off by saying that these are my favorite listening device I've ever owned. This includes more expensive headphones like the audio technica ath m50x's.

First the sound quality. It was the first time I was NOT somewhat disappointed with the sound signature of any headphones I've ever used. The sound signature is very pleasant to listen to. It has a slight emphasis on the low end and an absolutely amazing mid range. The only downside to the sound signature of these earphones to me was the rolled off high ends. Otherwise it's perfect.

Now the build quality. When I first got them, I found it was nearly impossible for me to take off the eartips. It's a very tight fit and you have to make sure to push the off using the plastic and not the foam. I tore off the foam from the plastic and ruined my large sized eartips. Just be VERY careful. (also I did wash these once and dried them and worked perfectly afterwards if that's important to anyone lol)

I've had these for over a year and a half and used them almost every single day for several hours a day. Not until around a month ago I started having issues with sound cutting out and sounding muffled in my right ear piece. Fortunately, it has detachable cables but they are fairly expensive to replace.

Other than that, I haven't had any issues with these and are still to this day my favorite, go-to earphones. I can definitely tell you that you won't find a better pair for under 100 dollars. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some great sounding earphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the things that stood out to me after listening to a lot of familiar music with these is that for IEMs, these have incredible soundstage; music doesn't sound ""in your head"", it seems as if the music is surrounding you (I believe this effect is more apparent when you've selected the best tips to fit inside your ears). I don't use any of the included tips and own several IEMs (some costing double what these cost) and like the Comply tips. The ones I use are in between the Large and Medium tips that Shure includes with these.

Pro Tip: The tighter the fit of the foam tips, the more bass these will deliver (but that also affects the middle and high frequencies). Using tips that aren't so tight lessens the bass response a bit and that's where you start to notice a more lush middle and upper frequency response, and the soundstage improves (and you can also hear your surroundings a bit more).

I wanted a decent pair of IEMs to go on walks and work out and didn't want to use my (more expensive) Klipsh and Etymotic IEMs and I honestly am liking these more and more. I love that the cable can be replaced should something happen.

Cons? They can be uncomfortable to wear as the drivers have to go inside your ear. I'm noticing this more on my right ear than my left after about an hour of use. Everyone's ears are different so it will depend on your sensitivity. For the price and quality these reproduce, I strongly suggest checking these out and wearing them for at least an hour to see if these would be comfortable for your ears."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are awesome.. I have some SE425s that I can use but the 215s are great for the gym and I've had no complaints from people when I'm on the phone. Love the fact I can switch back and forth between the different buds and the blue tooth was solid.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for a couple months now and I'm not as thrilled as most people. My main issues are fit and quality of noise isolation (not quality of sound). If you wear glasses with semi thick or thick frames, good luck to you! I almost returned these because trying to comfortably wear them with either pair of my glasses is a total nightmare. I would strongly suggest looking at another pair unless you are a 100% contact wearer or have very thin wire glass frames. Thankfully i wear contacts more than half the time.
Regarding the noise isolation, its good but I dont buy that its 100$ good. I have cheaper headphones that dont involve the uncomfortable fit with noise isolation that approaches this. And I tried every size option in the kit so I don't think this is user error. All in all, I'm a bit disappointmented."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am now on my second pair of these headphones. the previous ones having broken after extensive and rather rough usage.

Personally I consider these headphones the absolute best money can buy at this price-pont. there are definitely better ones if you are willing to spend 200-300 dollars, but personally I tend to be a bit tough on earbuds (Normally if I am using earbuds rather than full headphones it is because I don't want to have to carry extra stuff around, which results in them being roughly shoved into my pocked) so I normally prefer a decent pair of headphones at a lower mid-range price point so that I don't need to worry if I break or misplace them (as happened with the last few pairs).

As a result of this habit I have been through quite a few headphones at this price-point, normally I decide to try something new after the old one is lost or broken, these are the first pair of headphones that made me unable to do that. from their sound quality to their beautiful and comfortable design, when I go to look at another pair of headphones I can't help but think of everything that it will lack compared to these.

The over-the ear design is non-standard at this price-point, and it might feel a little weird for the first week or two if you have never used it before, but the shure design makes shure (heh) that it feels like the most natural thing in the world after that point. I can and often do forget that I have them in. they remain stable and comfortable regardless of my level of activity or motion.

The sound isolation is also fantastic. if I am listening to music on these I feel completely isolated from the outside world, and they are also extremely quite from an outside perspective (which is important to me, as I often end up using them in my quiet office). You can play your music at full volume for you, and from an outside perspective it will be almost completely silent until you take them off.

The design is modular to a degree, enabling you to easily switch the actual buds for comfort (It comes with both Silicon and Foam buds. personally I used to use Silicon more but I have now been fully converted to foam. it is just more comfortable and provides a better sound. they also provide a few different sizes of each so you can find which one fits your ears best. (and of course, you can always buy third party ones if you want. though it is less neccisary than with other headphones, since they are very-firmly secured and unlikely to fall off, even if you roughly shove them in pocket constantly like me)) as well as enabling you to remove and replace the cable should it become damaged (this has not been a problem for me, but it is still comforting to know, since it is much cheaper to replace a cable than it is to replace headphones). it also makes cleaning out ear-wax and other detritus easier.

All of these factors make for a fantastic overall product. I can say with confidence that these are the best headphones I have ever owned at this price point, (My favorite headphones overall for sure) and probably the best you are going to be able to get without moving up the price-scale significantly. I would definitely recommend them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, having the flexibility to upgrade existing headphones to Bluetooth is extraordinary. So what’s good and what could be improved...

The good?
- Battery life notification when you first turn it on, and it’s pretty accurate. Definitely got over 6 hours of use.

- Responsive controls, such as turning up/down volume

- Fair microphone, haven’t had a complaint when using it on calls yet

If I’m being critical...
- The lowest volume is actually too loud to me. (I’m a teenager) It really irks me that the notification voice, where she goes power on battery at X percent, is too loud for me and seems to be at a static volume.

- There are some minor blips when playing music, and these are amplified if you try to have it paired with more than one device (such as an iPhone and watch)

- There is occasionally this weird bug where it won’t let an iPhone play music, but restarting them fixes it.

Doesn’t really bother me...
- The battery pack. Yea it’s a little interesting having to clip it to your shirt, but it’s ok given that it’s a fairly long lasting battery. If it wrapped around the back of your neck, to me, it would get irritating if your jogging or exercising with them."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I'm listening to music with these, the sound cuts out which is really annoying and really frustrating. I want to enjoy listening to my music without having the sound cut out. These worked great for about 10 months before the sound started cutting out. They have a 2 year warranty, so I will contact Shure and get a replacement. But I expect the replacement to have the exact same problem unless Shure has changed the design. I think this is what's causing the sound to cut out: The detachable cable design, and corrosion on the metal connectors. Over time a very small amount of corrosion develops on the metal connectors, and this corrosion causes the sound to cut out. If I disconnect the cable from the headphones and wipe the corrosion off of the metal connectors, the sound cutting out problem stops for a while but then it comes back. And corrosion doesn't seem to be the only thing that is causing the sound to cut out, because other reviewers have reported the sound cutting out much sooner than 10 months. I think the nature of this detachable cable design results in the sound cutting out, even when no corrosion is present. In 2008 I bought Shure in-ear headphones that didn't have a detachable cable and the sound never cut out on those. They got stolen 4 years later. So, this is my message to Shure: ""Dear Shure, if you make all the components of these headphones out of high quality materials that are very durable, I think having a detachable cable is unnecessary. So, please change the design. No more detachable cable, please. Sincerely. And with respect. And with love. Your customer who has spent about $300 on 3 pairs of Shure headphones.""
—Levi from Utah"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sounding earphones. I use them for running and working out. The part of the plastic that goes around the ear is a little stiff but if you angle them correctly, they stay put fine.
I got these as a replacement to my seinheisser CX-500 that broke (but I had since 2009 so got excellent use from them).

Pro's:
-Excellent sound
-Good sound isolation, can't hear anything outside so you don't have to turn the volume up very loud at all.
-No feedback from the cord rubbing against your clothes messing up the music

Con's:
- The cord is a bit thick and heavy, much heavier than the CX-500's (which were REALLY light and thin). I could be biased since I've been using the CX cord exclusively for the past 6 years, lol. Maybe it's why there's no feedback from cord movement, in which case it's a plus
- The changeable tips are REALLY hard to take off. It's good once you have a size you like, no fear of them slipping off. But in the beginning while your'e trying to experiment to find the perfect size so you're changing to different ones, it's hard to do. Also not much of a major con.

All in all, I'd HIGHLY recommend them if you want good sound and to NOT hear the outside world while listening.

P.s., with the sound isolating cushions, you have to install them the same way you do ear plugs. Squeeze it up as thin as possible and then slip into your ear canal. Then the important part. You have to HOLD them there for a bit and wait for the foam to expand again so it'll stay in place and seal, just about 10 seconds or so and you're good, you'll have a nice soundproof fit, won't have to constantly readjust the earphones while you're running, they'll stay locked in."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great.
Sound isolation is good enough, though no better than foam earplugs.
The bluetooth reception is fair. If I have the phone in my left pocket the connection drops out.
When turned on a female voice LOUDLY announces the battery life and, even though I'm already listening to my media ""CONNECTED"". duh.
I haven't tried good noise-canceling earphones, so I can't compare."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Most people would've heard from forums or friends that the Shure SE215 is a great pair of earphones. This statement is true.
I'm no hardcore audiophile, but I really love this pair of earphones. It delivers bass really well, like, a really 'round' and punchy bass.
I don't think its treble and clarity stands out from the crowd, but it still does a decent job delivering vocals and instrumental chords.
I've paired it with a Hippo Cricri portable amp, and gosh does it sound great. The earphones have a lot of potential, as in, equalizing and bass boosting on your music player can be handled really well by the SE215.

The only real problem I have with it is that the cables get entangled with itself real easily and it's slightly challenging to put on. Looking past these problems, the earphones are perfect for mostly anyone.

For its price tag, it's a great buy, seriously! Anybody who falls into the ""I just want something great without spending too much but I don't know what to buy"" category, this is the earphone for you."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my review of the Shure SE215 in ear monitors. I've had these headphones for a decent amount of time, just over a year now. I've used these in all sorts of different scenarios, from studying, to sleeping, and even intense golf course maintenance. My review will be divided into 3 different sections: durability, design, and sound quality. Enjoy!

## A quick note on the ear tips

A lot of people really like the ear tips that come with these headphones. I used them for quite some time and was very happy with them. After a while, the memory foam started to get really gross and firm, so I decided to research some new tips. Much to my surprise, I discovered that the beloved Klipsch oval eartips fit these buds perfectly! I quickly bought them and couldn't be happier. I can confidently say, at least for my ears, the Klipsch oval tips blow any of the stock tips out of the water. The seal is fantastic, and they're easy to put on. They dont get uncomfortable over long periods of time, and they dont try to push themselves out of your ear like the memory foam tips. They're literally perfect for me. I **highly, highly** recommend you give them a shot instead of the stock eartips.

## Durability

These headphones are made out of plastic, and doesn't contain a single piece of metal in the enclosure. Don't let this fool you, however, these headphones are amongst the most durable in-ear buds I've ever owned (far surpassing the Klipsch Image X10 and S4, as well as the Monster Turbines, which have an *all metal* enclosure and Monster Beats Tour). I don't treat these headphones kindly either. I never put them in their carrying case and I frequently wear them in rugged environments, such as mowing the grass (in 95º heat) and, as stated earlier, golf course maintenance. I have the clear model, which has a kevlar and mesh lined cable. Once again, this cable is by far the most durable I've ever seen. The cable that came with these headphones when I purchased them wore out very quickly, I think it was a lemon. In less than a month of daily use, I found the sound would short out momentarily at random times. Thankfully, these headphones feature removable cables (a feature which really shouldn't be overlooked), so I bought another one and it's been working perfectly ever since. Overall, if you're looking to buy a pair of headphones that will last for *years* on end, these headphones are definitely the right call.

## Design

I love the design of these headphones. I dont really have any complaints, so I apologize in advance if I sound overwhelmingly positive. A huge advantage of having earbuds that sit flush with your ears (and dont stick out like typical earbuds) is that you can sleep with them! It's so great being able to lay my head on a pillow and not feel any pressure in my ear canals. If you use earbuds in the house, this is really a feature that should not be overlooked. Furthermore, since these headphones sit flush with your ears, you can wear them in the rain with minimal risk of water touching the driver enclosures (let alone actually seeping inside). Lastly, the way the cable wraps above your ear makes it very difficult for cable tension alone to pull them out. This means that the buds can literally stay in for days without the usual cable sways slowly wiggling them out of your ears. It also means that if the cable catches something (like a door handle), the earbuds aren't likely to get yanked out (which is usually a pretty jarring experience). The only problem I have with the clear model in particular is that the right angle headphone jack doesn't fit cases very well. I dont have a high-profile case, just a thin TPU shell around my iPhone 6. Despite the fact that my case is thin, it was still too thick to plug these headphones in. The black cable seems to be designed for mobile devices, because it doesn't have these issues fitting my case.

If you plan on using these with a phone, I recommend you buy the black variant.

## Sound quality

Sound quality is highly subjective. What I think sounds good, others might think sounds like garbage. This is why I try to reduce the weight of sound quality in my reviews, and instead, focus on the factual, measurable parts of these headphones. Lets get this out of the way, these headphones are **not** balanced. They have a significant bias towards the lower frequencies: bass, but it can also turn some people off. Unlike some other bass-boosted headphones on the market, these headphones aren't a complete mess when you get to the higher end of the spectrum. Trebles are very clear, sharp, and precise. The trebles are very independent of the lower frequencies (high mids in particular), which is a great characteristic to see at this price point. I wish they were just a brighter (trebles should be louder), but its not a deal breaker, especially if you aren't a huge audio snob like I am. Shure always does a great job with their mids, and these headphones are no exception. They're very clear, controlled, and accurate. Sometimes, in very complex songs, the bass will run into the mids, causing things to sound muddier than they should, but its not a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination. These scenarios are generally few and far between.

Overall, I think a lot of people will be happy with the sound of these headphones. They have the bass-boosted emphasis of most modern headphones, however, it isn't overdone, and it doesn't come at the expense of the mids (in most scenarios) or the trebles. For $100, you're not going to get a perfect pair of headphones, but you can get one thats pretty damn good for most people. Unless you're a *serious* audio snob, or you listen *strictly* to spoken word audio, I highly recommend the Shure SE215 (in black). Seriously though, pick up a set of the Klipsch eartips while you're at it. You **will not** regret it."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a stellar set of headphones. I use these as monitors when I play drums for my church and in my band. They can get LOUD with no loss of sound quality at all. The sound isolation is great thanks to the foam tips and the quality and clarity from the drivers is phenomenal. Please note that if you are into the bigg booming bass and ""loudness"" feel to your music, these are not the headphones for you. These are for accurately portraying the sound that an artist is meaning to show you. Every high and low is there but not overpowering like what you get from the BEATS by Dre headphones (which are total garbage). If you do want to have a heavier bass response then I would suggest a set of SOL headphones. They are excellent quality and relatively inexpensive as far as higher-end headphones go."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first in ear headphones, and I am still impressed even 6 months of purchasing. There is quite a bit of noise cancelling with just inserting them into my ears. I have to take out atleast ear bud so I can hear people talking to me. I wear these at Church using our P16 Monitors from Behringer. The bring out all the frequencies I need and have quite good bass. If they got messed up, I would probably purchase these again or another shure IEM."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to splurge on these since I have the Shure SE 115 m+ for my iphone, which I was already very happy with. However, it was worth it!

These are much more comfortable, although more difficult to put in your ears right (maybe taking 10 seconds instead of 2). Over time, they are more comfortable to wear than the Shure SE 115m+ and they sound better to me too. They also isolate better, whereas with the SE115, I have to put them really deeply in my ears to get good isolation. With these SE215, it's not the case, thus they're very comfortable to me.

Cons:
- the cord is a little bit too long
- how about offering the SE215 m+ style, with integrated mike and remote? You would think there are enough iphone/ipad users who would be interested! Paying another $50 for their mobile remote is not a good solution. It adds more cord (which is already too long) and the mike is far away from your mouth and sounds too loud to people."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily the best ear buds I've owned. That being said, the only other high end ear buds I've used were Etymotics or Klipsh. Those were great as well, but this nails fit and sound isolation with a low profile. My only complaint would be that the cable, while high quality, has a fairly stiff section near the buds which is probably intended to keep them in place by wrapping around the back of your ear, but instead make fitment needlessly tricky, IMO. That's a very minor quibble. Otherwise, I'd recommend these to anyone who needs sound isolating IEMs, or for motorcyclists who need something to wear that clears their helmet. It works great for that latter application."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick Review:
Background: First $25+ Earbuds. Used to enjoy my iFrogz Nylon Cord earbuds prior to this purchase but right side stopped producing any sound so had to make a new purchase.
Compared: Klipsche 6i, Bose True Sound, Shure SE215. Klipsche was similarly priced as the Shure and Bose was close to $200. Shure had positive reviews on Amazon, SoundGuys and other websites.
Review:
Pros: Sound is awesome. The earplugs fit comfortably. Tried M size and S size earplugs which were provided and settled on the M. The sound is well balanced and very clear.
Cons: It is difficult to get the cord to bend over the ear, but I am assuming that this is because it is new and that eventually it will become easier.

Closing: A fantastic purchase and am absolutely satisfied by this purchase. The sound quality makes me want to listen to much more music than I usually do."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With my job I am in front of a computer all day so I wear headphones 5 days a week 8hrs a day. I had tried out several low cost earbuds but struggled with finding a comfortable pair that would stay in my ear all day with ease. Today was the first day I used these at work and I am really impressed. Comfort is 5 stars as well as the sound quality and sound isolation. Some one can be right next to me talking and all I hear is the music. The over ear style cord wrap worried me since I wear glasses but I had no problems with that. I only had one issue with these headphones - they are a little awkward to put in to your ears so if you needed to take them out a lot during use, it's a little bit of a hassle but I'm confident that will change after more use. The biggest thing that stood out was the rich quality of songs with guitars like Nirvana, Sublime and Red Hot Chili Peppers. I listen to a lot of hip-hop too and the bass sounds excellent."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are in a class well above their price point. To say these buds are the best and clearest sound from ANY headphone/earbuds I have used would be doing these a disservice. The first purchase anyone who has these should make is the triple flange earbud replacements. Not only do they provide passive noise cancellation, but the sound is also pushed further into your ear. The highs are crisp and with no distortion at all. The lows still can hit with the strength of any Beats branded buds, but with a smooth and clean hit. The mids are clear and are best found in classical music or specific genres that rely on midrange. Very comfortable to wear for up to six or seven hours at a time and do not pull out of the ear without serious tugging."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of Shure headphones about EIGHT years ago. They were great quality but broke after 3ish years. They were sitting in a drawer at my parents and my dad found them a couple weeks ago. He called Shure and asked about a warranty. They sent a FREE pair of these headphones. Incredible customer service and I'll only by Shure in the future.

In regards to these particular headphones: they sound great. I love the fact that the drivers detach so that the cable can be replaced (which is where headphones usually break first).

Buy these headphones and you won't regret the sound or warranty."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never tried serious IEMs before. These ones are nice. Sit comfortable, cable noise is rarely heard. I wear them with cables around the ears, as the instruction suggests--probably it's *the* way to wear IEMs, not sure. A few different molds are included, and I think I've found ones fitting. The construction seems to be solid, I don't think I'll accidentally break the cable (as it happened before with cheaper in-ear phones).

Some time is required to put the phones on or off, but I think I'll get used to it. However, it would be better if the part of cable that goes around the ear bent a bit more.

I like the sound, bass is not too much but enough. Probably a bit lacking in high frequencies, but of course that's just me after Beyerdynamic cans that maybe have an excess of those. Also, I don't know how IEMs should or can sound like, so my opinion isn't really relevant here. I like that I can listen to music on pretty low levels even in a street noise, but it's dangerous in that you may not hear a car driving right behind you."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy to be back in Shures! This is my 2nd (replacement) pair of Shure earphones for an older set I lost. Upgrading to this price point makes all the difference. My interest in music varies from classical, R&B, rock, pop, electronica, and country. These work with all genres. Make sure the sleeves fit your ear perfectly; this is how music should sound."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 3 of them, one after one, died becuse of sweat, real disappointment, shure should stop selling it till they will make a better quality one. It's making very bad reputation for the company."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a lot of reviews here that talk about technical specifics about the SE 215's. I'd like to take a different approach to offer my praise (for the record, I'm a music composer/producer and sound quality means worlds to me). When my wife found out these were $100 she was none too pleased...""$100 for earbuds?!? Seems excessive to me,"" she said. I tried to explain the quality and durability of the SE 215's but she wasn't hearing it. When they arrived and I had her listen to a few songs through these, she was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. It was the ""crap I know I'm wrong about these so how do I hide it?"" grin. When I asked her if she thought they were worth the money, she began to comment how effective the sound-isolating was (all of a sudden she couldn't hear me).

Agree with a lot of folks here. Impeccable clarity, profound bass, ridiculous sound. Stop thinking about buying these and buy them. Worth every penny."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the ways these sounds. Nice flat response and accurate earphones. No exaggerated bass or any artificial sound. Within the first hour of using with each session tho, the inside of my ear gets irritated. I used all 6 pairs of ear plugs and no luck. I think it may be a design flaw or maybe I have odd ears lol. I also wouldnt recommend these for any activities. You need to stay in place to ensure best sound."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Only earbuds I've owned that have lasted longer than 2 months. Sound is crisp and clear. If you want good quality earbuds these are the best around $100.

EDIT: The wire that wraps around my ear broke after a few months of use and the Shure warranty took longer than a week to replace it. If only their warranty was faster this would be 5 stars."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The stiff plastic that is supposed to bend over the top of your ear to hold them in place makes these awkward in the extreme to put on. If you wear glasses, forget it. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish right from left on these. The documentation doesn't tell you how and you find that you have to hunt for a tiny, tiny red dot on one of them, presumably the right channel, something that's going to be nigh impossible on, say, a darkened stage. There is no reason, none whatsoever, that they couldn't stamp a much more visible ""L"" on the left and ""R"" on the right. To make matters worse, the stiff plastic cable on these conducts a tremendous amount of contact noise to the earbuds. The result is a most annoying scraping sound with every little movement. They should have used a softer, more flexible cable.

See the other reviews for accounts of how these fall apart or stop working after a short period of use.

This is one of Shure's poorer designs to be ""shure"" and the sound quality isn't good enough to compensate for it. I would look for something else."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these about two years ago as a Christmas gift. Have always enjoyed the sound quality, noise isolation, and comfort. However, the flexible wiring near the earphones came a little twisted. I was fine with this until recently when I started experiencing one ear's sound going out. To get the sound working again, I usually just twist the cable and adjust near the earpieces. A minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless. Also makes me worried about the durability of these earphones. Hope they work for a long time because I love them! Just don't want to say goodbye because of a lack in build quality."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these to death! These are the best IEM's for $100 hands down. The sound is clear as can be for this price oint. I use these for about 3 hours a day between school, walking my dog, and going for runs. They are also the most comfortable IEM's I have ever worn. The wire wrapping around your ear doesn't take getting used to at all but does take a few days to learn how to put on. I wouldn't recommend another pair of IEM's over these for $100."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mid bass bloat colors this rather hard presentation. Treble is OK and can be airy, but they lack low bass and there are better phones out there at this price point."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds sound great, but after a few months the plastic shell split in two. I sent it in (as it is covered under warranty), and had the same earbuds returned un-fixed. I'd otherwise give these a high rating, but the shotty assembly and failure to hold up their warranty, I have to give Sure a 2/5 on this one."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Today I received my SE215's from Amazon. Sadly, I am disappointed. The first issue is one of quality control on Shure's part. Many reviewers have mentioned issues with the left earbud cutting out and this was the case with the pair that I received. I really like the idea of being able to replace the cable on a set of headphones, however I think this design is what ultimately leads to so many issues with loss of signal.

The issue is definitely in the cable and not the earbuds themselves. I tried to isolate the issue by removing and reconnecting the cable, I also tried swapping the left/right connections. The issue was intermittent and there were times when I thought I had solved the issue, but it always returned.

These earbuds do sound good, but not enough to justify the price. Many reviewers have commented on the bass response. Proper fit is essential for bass response in any earbud. Overall, I felt that the sound was very balanced and clean. The thing that impressed me most was the stereo separation which in my opinion is the closest to over-the-ear headphones that I have experienced with an in-ear monitor.

I'm going to return the Shure SE215 for a refund and just keep enjoying my pair of Panasonic RPHJE120K ($7.18 from Amazon) that I received for Christmas!

Bottom Line:
1) Great balanced sound and stereo separation.
2) Proper fit is the key to good sound and bass response.
2) Concerns about Shure quality control.
3) The replaceable cable is a gimmick that is going to lead to problems down the road.

I would not recommend this product."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst in-ears I've ever purchased. Right at the end of the 2 year warranty period, the right side went out. Would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I've been through Bose IEM's and SkullKandy's and these are by far extraordinarily superior and are only $99 right now.The bass is incredibly rich sounding and not overbearing as well as the treble having a perfect balance that's not crunchy sounding. I was hesitant about the cable being placed over the ears however they feel great and the cords do not brush against your cheeks like other head phones.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these at an airport kiosk to replace my stock apple ear buds. I primarily bought these for the isolation qualities -- crying babies, jet noise.

I don't know what impressed me more, the sound isolation or the sound quality, both are excellent.
Another nice feature is that with the sound quality and isolation, you hardly need to turn the volume up.
Shure's fitting system is a little hard to adjust to at first, but after a while the cord molds to your ear shape and with practice, the monitors insert in easily.

Shure also deserves credit for recognizing the two most likely damaged components of in-the-ear monitors: the ear tips and the cords, can be replaced, thus leaving
your investment in the electronics safe."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these from a different account to explain why I'm not verified. They sounds the way they should, when they work. My cable stopped responding to the buttons and I have to plug them into a power source to ""jump start"" them. And the moment the music stops they disconnect. Rinse repeat."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel a little bit more sane after reading the negative reviews of the SE215s that mention the flaw regarding the left ear piece. Of course, most of those reviews were written just after I purchased them and also after the small window I had to return them. At least I'm not the only one...and at least I don't feel like I'm literally cursed when it comes to ear buds.

Yes, the left ear piece also inexplicably died after about a month and a half of actual use. Right now, I can either listen to them and have the left ear drop out every time I move my head (which causes a new level of Rage)...or I can send them back for replacements and expect the same thing to happen.

Guess I'll send them back as they're still under warranty, though it's way past the time by which I could return them.

I dished out good money because of the Shure name, so to say this is disappointing is a major understatement. This is extremely annoying/enraging. I like the sound on the SE215s, I like the fact that there's no wire noise, and they drowned out sound pretty well, so much so that (if they worked) I could well by run over by a bus as I was trying to adjust the left ear piece in the street.

The design and fit on these is strange, so please take note (aside from the fact that they, you know, BREAK after a couple of months). These are like in-ear monitors...the piece goes all the way into your ear (so you can feel like Bono or someone on stage), and annoyingly, the wire goes up and around and back of your ear...which I suspected was why they may have given out since I was constantly adjusting them. No, only the left one.

The design is odd and definitely not for everyone (unless, again, you love adjusting wires and sticking them behind your ears/hair). The other thing, oh yeah, THEY BREAK EASILY. Forget about ""burning them in""---what's the point? The 50 hours that will take is a fraction of the time the things will actually work in your ear.

Thanks, Shure. I think by the time I'm done buying ear buds I'll have paid enough money to get the iPod installed in my cranium, where I can never turn it off.

NOT recommended."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have the best fit of any headphones I have ever tried. The foam tips block sound out, and help you have great sound at lower volume (protect your hearing!) those reviews that say it's a complicated fit or hard to get in your ears... Yes it takes a few seconds more to secure the fit because they have a memory cord. That's a GOOD thing! It helps keep the headphones secure in your ear by taking the weight if the headphones off the cord. Just takes a few times to get used to it. Best $100 headphone I've tried out of Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I entered a contest to win a couple of concert tickets and won these as a consolation prize. These were the best earphones I ever owned. The sound quality was superb and I could run in them without ever worrying about them falling off. They were comfortable enough for me to just put them on and forget about them. Unfortunately, I was being clumsy and careless with them and one of the buds broke beyond repair. When I came online to see about getting another pair I saw how expensive they were. These were more expensive than six of those tickets I was trying to win, so it was a heck of a prize while it lasted."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Sennheiser earphones for about 6 years, they worked great (I lost them), sound and build quality were great, but.. That was until I've got these earphones, and in one word - SUPERB!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are fantastic! I have had great Bluetooth connectivity with fantastic range and battery life. Terrific sound quality. Additional ear inserts included with a nice clip to attach cable to clothing. I don't travel anywhere without them.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I frequently use these earphones, as I'm out and about every day. They're great for having on the subway and they cancel noise out way better than the Bose. I often miss my stop on the train, because I can't hear the voice announcing the stop, and I don't listen that loud. The inserts mold perfectly to my ear and are more comfortable than the Bose.

Also, I had a previous pair of Bose break due to my cat biting them. She bit right through the speaker on her first try. She's also gotten a hold of these, but the speak is protected by a hard plastic barrier due to the construction on the ear bud, so she can't bit through it, unless she has it for awhile perhaps."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are phenomenal. The sound is crisp and neutral/honest. if you have a heavy bass sound in the source, you will hear it. These headphones will not add bass where it was not intended. For all the people complaining about them.. You must understand you can't just buy these and plug them into any device and expect them to sound amazing.
First, you need to provide high quality source content. MP3's will not cut it. Even high the ""Extreme"" option on Spotify will not do these headphones justice. You need to find high bit-rate lossless audio from a proper source. Beatport, Tidal or a CD ripped in the right format and bit-rate will work.
Secondly, you need the right hardware. You can't expect to plug these into any new android, idevice or laptop and get a good sound. There are some exceptions. One of the last android devices with a good DAC (Google it) was the European version of the Samsung Galaxy S2. The Galaxy Note 4 International or newer MacBook Pro do have a good quality DAC. Wolfson or Yamaha make great DACs. This component is essential for a good listening experience, as well as proper settings.
Using an under powered device, like an iphone can actually damage the drivers (speaker core) inside the headphones. For those who don't want to bother would probably be better off with lower quality consumer grade headphones like Bose or Beats."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This things are amazing.... have a tight fit and sound crystal clear... they are the only headphones this size that compete vs. my Bose QC25... and mobile 100%. They are amazing.

To be blunt, I'm in love with them. I'm hearing sounds in music that just weren't being reproduced by the other audio systems I have (cheap ones, admittedly). The full range of sounds are clear and faithfully rendered, though the bass may be a little low for some depending on musical taste. I'm also happy to say that the foam buds keep these things firmly in place through just about any situation I've had them in so far, whether it be walking, running, or even snowboarding. Money well spent, and highly recommended."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to write a review after reading all these morons using these for walking,biking etc. THESE ARE FOR MUSICIANS AND PERFORMERS FOR LIVE SETTINGS!!!! THESE ARE MEANT TO BLOCK OUT LOUD SOUNDS AND ISOLATE WHAT YOURE HEARING IN YOUR EARS!!! Duh! And if you cry babies have a problem they come with different size ear buds for a reason! Okay now thats off my chest, I am a touring/studio drummer and I always used the Shure E2's...they don't make them anymore, I was worried about the price of these, I believe you get what you pay for. I am BEYOND AMAZED by these and I will buy these again!!! I play to a click track live and wanted something THAT BLOCKED OUT NOISE AROUND ME AND THATS WHAT THESE ARE FOR. To you people who jog,walk,bike or whatever with any kind of earbuds or headphones you're a moron and deserve to get ran over by a bus. Use common sense!!! I HIGHLY recommend these AS A MUSICIAN AND PERFORMER ...after all thats what they are made for!!!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first purchase from Shure. The first pair was defective and returned and replaced. Just bad luck? Probably, Shure is noted for being better than this and stuff happens. These come with a nice zippered kit, a wax cleaner for those who never heard of Q-tips and an assortment of silicon and foam tips (affectionately called ""olives"" the name that just stuck with owners). I really didn't need these as I have an assortment of other buds but I just couldn't resist them based on all the positive feedback being posted. Initial impressions, a well built plastic bud with detachable cable...miles and miles of cable. Designed to be used with the cable over the ear and draped either behind or in front of the wearer, there is memory wire to bend around the top of your ears. Don't be shy, bend away and you will eventually get the hang of it but it takes a bit of trial and error before I got the hang of it. These fit in the ear canal at a natural angle and are very secure and comfortable. Sound isolation from external noise is moderately successful in all but loud environs and microphonics (the sound transmitted to your ears from rubbing the cable) is better than most others. The deal with replaceable cables is to be able to get long life from your investment in the case of failure as parts are interchangeable. It also can be and I'm just guessing here, be the weak link. Both buds and cable are plenty sturdy and expected to last and last. The slider is smooth operating and stays put. Did I mention how long the cable is? Long.
OK so ya ya ya ... how do these sound? Not as good as my $400 buds but 97% as good, and for $100 bucks that's saying it all. The drivers are dynamic (think itty bitty speakers) and the bass is contained, tight accurate and enough for my tastes. If you like sitting in traffic next to a ramped up sub-woofer in the car next to you on a hot day than these aren't for you. The bass is as it should be at least to my ears. The mids are crystal clear, vocals in particular are sweet and a bit warm with good resonance and timbre and the highs have a bit of sparkle that's quite appealing. Overall the entire frequency response is well balanced and blended. Now I'm listening to MP3's which are quite compressed and somewhat lacking but these make a a silk purse out of a sows ear. Perfect..and for $100 bucks...they rock! You don't get it all but what isn't there most listeners won't notice and even if you do you won't care, these are that good. I'll stop here but I want to add a discovery that's an option that I found and use. Klipsch(the other guys) made a discovery that's akin to the world being round, not flat. Ear canals are oval not round, Duh! They make oval tips. Really really nice comfortable oval tips. I use them on my 215's and the buds disappear and all that's left is sound. Just a suggestion."

Just realize that these are not your typical earphones, probably don't want to use them for running or crossing streets (because they do a great job of noise isolating). They can also be a bit tricky to put on, but once you get the hang of it they become easier to put and feel very comfortable."

If you already have something hang up on your ear, your glasses, sun glasses or like me, simply like to put hair behind ear, it becomes very embarrassing, and I have to do all kinds of awkward action to put it on.

I found them a little too big for my ears (part of the hard plastic pushes a bit on my skin and after a long period of time, it leaves a small mark), but I don't really notice it until I take them off. Its a little complicated getting used to putting them on correctly, but once they're on, they stay on great. Considering the price, I would buy these again. Best earphones I've owned for around 100 dollars."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why everybody is raving about THESE earphones. To me, they're JUST AVERAGE - but certainly acceptable. As for bass boost, I sure can't detect any - can somebody comment on this! HOWEVER they are ergonomically far superior to other earphones I've worn and are extremely comfortable once you figure out how to insert them. However this superior ergonomic design unfortunately creates an extremely inferior acoustic sound-delivery design for ALL versions of Shure earphones! Am I the only one who realizes this? If you look at the exploded diagram for ALL versions, you will see there is a plastic nozzle that funnels the sound from the micro-driver at an angle (through the foam earpiece) into your ear through a bore/diameter of a few mm! Thus, the offset micro-driver is in NO WAY in the most optimal position to deliver music to your ear! Exactly how are you delivering quality undistorted music - especially decent bass - through a plastic nozzle? I certainly don't see how this could work, and it certainly doesn't work for me! To continue with ergonomics the earphones are very sturdy with a nice sized jack that is not going to break easily that's for sure - having handled one too many ultra flimsy subminiature stereo jacks. The earphone wires detach from the drivers separately so you can replace those. Summary: Average sound with undetectable bass boost. Very sturdy in construction but the sound delivery design that is is badly compromised! Guess it's back to my flimsy Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds that sounded way better than these at half the price because the drivers are directly opposite your eardrums. I'll take those earphones or any earphones where the drivers are unobstructed and directly opposite your drums. So that's my take and please, any comments off of this posting are most welcome."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these in-ears for multiple things. Live playing, mixing and just listening to music on the train. Beautiful EQ with just a tad bit of low end so that it doesn't sound tinny. I would recommend these to anyone. They cancel so much out (since they are in-ear headphones) One thing however is that you need to get used to the pressure of having them in your ear but after that you're all set."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent mid-range earphones. It will suit everyone except for the most critical audiophile out there. Shure is the brand I've been using for ages and will not move away from them.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price, you won't really find much better out there. Especially when these thing are designed to never fall out of your ears. I use them at work to clear out the white noise and while I'm working out to kill all the background noise. 10/10 would recommend."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice Bass heavy signature. Really good indeed. It's not by any means a balanced iems, it is bass heavy and the highs are a bit lacking. I like that! Flat signatures are boring in my honest opinion.

It's also very isolating, something some people don't like but I love.

Overall it is a fantastic I'm, I struggle to find any big con's."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these are awesome one of the best. My dad bought these for me for Christmas and the sound amazing but it only lasted a day or so when the left ear did not work anymore :(.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start with the CONCUSIION: Perhaps the best sound available for the money, with one caveat.

BUILD: Over the Top. This is professional gear suitable as on-stage in-ear monitors. I've been through 2 sets of Sony headphones whose cables tangle incessantly and short out too quickly. While stiff, these cables appear bullet proof and are replaceable if not. That's great ""cable insurance"". Note: I believe a burn-in is necessary as well as the right tip for your ear. I am happy with the foam that came installed.

WEAR: Comfortable and will not dislodge, Period.

SOUND: (Disclaimer: A true Audiophile avoids the use of a graphic equalization, so I'm disqualified. To my ear, all phones / speakers can be improved by shaping the sound. I'm a semi-pro performing rock/pop drummer. I want some kick in my sound. My Reference Sound: Sony MDR-EX300, Bose QC15, BMW Premium Sound. Main source material for this review: Seal (1994), a very well produced album.

With a single driver Sure had to sacrifice some upper and lower end sound, but far less than you might expect. There is a natural ""open"" sound that is fun to listen to and never harsh. Separation, soundstage and overall articulation are very good. Way better than MDR-EX300 and even the QC15 in most arias.

Highs: The super transient highs are rolled off, yes, but only by spending twice the money would I expect improvement. Meanwhile what is there is effortless and pleasing.

Mids: Here is where they really shine. Seal's vocals have never sounded better. Usually I need to reduce the mid's with EQ. Not here. No closed or ""boxy"" sound. Great instrumental sound in this range.

Base: Clean, articulate, if lacking what the QC15 offers in the very low end. I have a long low reference base note in Seal's ""Bring it On"". It's right at the words ""So what lies undone is your Kingdom Come"". The Sure's handled it well enough, though not ground moving. The QC15s are better here. But what more do you expect for the price and seize considering the very good Mids and Highs? I'd say nothing.

What is pleasing is the natural mix of all 3, High/Mid/Base. This allowed me to hear new things in songs I've loved for years. That's impressive.

THE ONE CON: These baby's need to be ""installed"" in your ears, not popped in like your standard ear bud. It takes two hands for each ear. This is a lot of fuss just to listen to one song. It takes time and effort compared to anything you've had before. Not a deal breaker, just know this going in.

VERDICT: Don't waste your time looking for better sound at this price. Better to waste it instead on the effort ""installing"" them in your ears. I'm perfectly willing to."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the earbuds drummers would wear to hear the drum-kit and the rest of the instruments. They muffle sound as you put them in and when your music plays you can barely hear anything. Therefore you and your music. Only complaint is that you have to burn them in a little to get some bass in (my music).. But totally worth it.. Really reliable and comes with wax pick..
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these the other day an I was a little skeptical because I like good bass and also being able to hear good highs. Typically you either get one or the other. Shure NAILED this product! These are amazing! I can play my acoustic and sing and the highs will come out great or play bass on them and get the lows! I LOVE THESE! If you are hesitant like I was, Just pull the trigger and buy them! You will not be disappointed!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from my 8yr old Shure pair and was getting sick of the pairs that came with my phones. Definitely an improvement over their old model, my ears fit into either the medium or large gel inserts, which leads me to believe that as long as u relatively have no trouble with other in-ear buds these WILL fit snug.

i wpuld like try another in ears.I am a sound engineer and I do not recommend this product"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this earphones for 4 years and it is still perfect. My friend bought same pair but she replaced the cable twice within 4 years (she is not good at keeping things) If you use it with a bit of carefulness, it will last really long. I think of upgrade to new earphones but don't know when mine will be broken"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these over 4 years ago and have used them almost everyday since. Sound just as great as the day I got them and I've had no problems with them. Highly highly Recommend
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these as in-ear monitors on stage and they are fantastic. Low end comes through solidly and everything else is nice and crisp. I really like how they ""disappear"" in my ear and is not really visible on stage. The short section of wire just past the driver really helps keep it tucked away and secure. I also used these during studio recording, and they did just fine. At this price range, I couldn't be happier. Booya!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7 months old, treat them like crud, and they sound as good as the day i bought them.

I think i bought a lucky pair as many people had them short out. Lucky me.

I recommend them to bass lovers and people who find treble irritating (very smooth sounding headphones)

Decent sound stage and great bass response. The noise is also locked in so you can listen without bothering others.

Highly recommended."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,I owned the clear set. It isolated sound wonderfully and sounded great. After about 2.5 years they degraded quite fast. It was disappointing as I used these infrequently and didn't wind them up tightly either. Overall if I am spending $100 on headphones they should last longer. I have a pair of Bose that are just as old and they work flawlessly still.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,They say that you will notice a huge difference between headphone sound quality once you spend that first $100. These headphones fit nicely as I like the wrap around style and the sound quality was nice but compared to a cheap pair of $30 skull candies I had I heard no difference. This is because there is still only one driver. If you want a pair of headphones with night and day difference in sound quality compared to regular headphones then get a pair with at least two drivers. This of course means you'll be dropping at least $200.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ear stopped working after three months, Amazon will not accept a return on this item after two months. I am screwed."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds are excellent. I use them predominantly on plane flights both to listen to audio and as ear plugs. They are very comfortable and can easily be left in without fatigue pain for the duration of a long haul flight. Now for the sound. These things are superb, rich sound with excellent bass response. Mid and high range have a calrity that needs not equalization tweaks with your mp3 player."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are a good choice if you prefer:
1) good sounding dynamics;
2) detachable cable;
3) iPhone compatibility (for that you'd need to buy a cable with remote/mic).

I like the sound and build quality of this model. If you buy it together with an iPhone-compatible cable it will be cheaper than Monster Turbine with ControlTalk (140 USD vs. 169).

Highly recommended."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: very good sound isolation. Actually considering using when I go trap shooting. Equally as good as the earplugs I usually use.

Was looking forward to using them on my next long flight if they hadn't stopped working.

Cons:
- A bit awkward to put on. Takes a bit getting used to.
- Right bud stopped working after very light use (only at my desk at work) for 3 months. I know it's the bud not the wire because I swapped the buds and the left one worked on the right wire.

They should still be under warranty but I got them as part of a prize package at work so I don't have the purchase receipt required to get warranty service. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay all the $$ for these. I would be TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

If you buy these KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. You WILL need it WHEN (not if) you have to send it in for repair."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro's:
- Earbuds sounded good when they were in.

Con's:
- Difficult to put in ears.
- Once in ears they were uncomfortable.
- Earbuds are heavy and the cord is heavy.
- Cord was way to long for walking around and having come out of pocket.
- Sound cuts in and out on iphone 4 when the connector rotates the plug.
- Fit kit sleeves were extremely difficult to remove when trying to find a good fit. Internet forums said to freeze the earbuds to help.
- The cord nearest the earbuds is made to wrap around the ear. Made it more difficult to put on and with the combined weight of the cord bothered my ears.

All in all these were not for me. I have had a few great over the ear monitors in my life and was not prepared for the hassle they would be. They hurt my ears, cut in and out and needed to be frozen to adjust. I like the idea of earplugs with great sound but not with all this hassle. According to the reviews many people love them, but I STRONGLY suggest you give these or earbuds very similar a try before you buy. I returned them. You might love them. Who knows."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215 are great. Forward, reasonably lush mids, great bass with a little midbass hump but nothing like Westone 3; it's right in line with the subbass except when more impact is called for. Never drowns out the mids. Highs are unimpressive but also inoffensive, slightly rolled off, not very sparkly but fairly clear.

Great buy at $100. Still my favorites after trying multiple higher end armature setups. I've been searching for something that delivers the same great balance of mids and bass and I have yet to find it."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these headphones in June and by September the right ear started jumping in and out. After the last few months of dealing with it (because the Shure website had a very convoluted warranty system) the left ear finally died as well. I'm really frustrated because I know Shure has the ability to make great and near indestructible pieces of equipment ie the sm 57. This is the second pair of headphones that I've bought from Shure that has died within 6 months of purchase the last one being the SRH 840's. I hate saying this but I'd urge others to avoid Shure's headphones because they are overall pretty hit or miss on the quality front.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying these are the BEST earphones I have ever tried. The sound quality rivals headphones such as the M-50 and porta pros and surpasses beats and bose. The only thing holding it back is its disgusting durability. I have had these for less than a month and the left ear is already breaking. I put down $120 on these earphones and I am EXTREMELY disappointed at this. The sound quality was great and I was considering replacing my over ear headphones with these, however, given that these broke, I can't. DO NOT BUY THESE EARPHONES. When I read that the left earphone breaks from other review I unfortunately didn't believe it. Believe every review that says the left earphone breaks. This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that IPOD headphones last longer than this says something.

UPDATE

1 Star. I owned it for a year and my fourth pair broke. I paid nearly 50 dollars for returns. Stay away."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great but are hard to take and put on.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decided to pick these up at Guitar Center because I was looking for portable and good sounding IEMs. Sound is mediocre, I got just as good sound and way better bass response from my Sennheiser cx150's which cost a fraction of the price at $40 and I got FAR superior sound from my Sennheiser IE80's. Be aware that there are better options out there."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on this is first rate but forget about simply tossing them in at the gym. These are the most difficult headphones I've ever used. The fit is complicated with a bendable material around the wires closest to the in ear portion. This part is made to loop up and over the ear. The section of the zip cable from where it splits to the phones is on the short side making the cable somewhat tight when worn. I'm not certain, perhaps this is the only way to get this level sound from a tiny in ear phone. However I'm not sure the trade off in ease of use and comfort is worth the trade off."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I used them for about 3 years and the seemed to do the trick. I play guitar and was forced to use In-Ear monitors sand the did the trick until both drivers went out. No ptoblem you can replace the drivers, they are detachable. And cost $70 each.
So buying a new set but will go with a different brand that several musician freinds are using and that cost 1/2 as much and the company gives a 50% replaceent cost no matter what happens to them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones so that I could wear them while riding my motorcycle. They do a great job of fitting in your ear so the helmet still fits comfortably and the sound truly is far superior and more isolated than with any other headphone I tried so far. The only reason I did not give this item a 5 star is because they aren't very practicle in any situation where you might want to take them out and put them back in more often. An example of this would be at the gym. They are just too much of a hassle to put in your ear properly for that and the cord is too rigid.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound, noise isolation (with the right foam) and comfort. They're almost comparable to their 5x more expensive cousins -the SE530s - which I've been using for about 3 years now. I've used other sound isolating earphones over the years in the $50-500 range and for $100 these are very impressive - I will be getting a couple more to give as presents!! Highly recommended."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I truly love these earphones! Sound quality is great. I previously owned some Nergy earphones and no comparison. However, the over-the-ear thing does take some time to get used to, but not a huge problem"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a new pair to replace my old black SE215 that I thought I lost. After about a week I noticed that the sound with slightly cutting out; I just thought it was my old iPhone. I tried then on my computer, iPad, and old CD player etc and noticed the sound problems. In the mean time I found my old SE215 so I switched out the cords and that solved the problem. I wanted a replacement cord since I paid for a new set of SE215.

I emailed Shure explaining the problem with my included invoice when I purchased them. I get an email to call the service department so I did. Then I get a rude individual named Anthony that says I have go BACK to their website for a form. Then send in the cord AT MY OWN Expense that will not be covered for a defective product. And the cord my not even be covered.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would just like to say that when it comes to music sound quality, I'm spoiled. I have a sound system in my car that cost me a few K's, and as unfair as it may be, I compare all sound sources to it.

Of course, one cannot expect in-ear headphones to sound exactly like a car's sound system, but one can expect for them sound a little like it. At the $150 and below price range, these are the ones!

I've tried many, many in-ear headphones. Klipsch S4's, Monster Turbines, Audio Technica ATH-CKS70's and the Sony MDR-EX300's just to name a few. Let me say that each of the in-ear's just mentioned perform admirably, but, the SE215's do what all the others do well, in one package. The high's of the S4's? Check. The bass of the Turbine's and CKS70's? Check. The balanced sound of the EX300's? Check. Add to these features the replaceable cable, the perfect seal foam tips, durable construction, great looking transparent enclosure and what can I say? Ladies and gentlemen, I think I have found a keeper.

Two cons that I've found in this model:
1) while the cabling looks like a it's better quality than my old pair, there is a slight texture on the wire that when walking rubs against my clothes and carries the sound (via vibration on the outer wire) straight to my ear. It's bizarre, but annoying!

2) the old pair had a black mark, about the size of a dime, on the inside to designate the right ear; this was very useful when putting the headphone on as you can quickly and easily identify which one goes in the right ear. This also allowed you to see it in low light. The SE215 pair has a more elegant, yet small (about the size of a pin head), dot in either blue or red. When I first saw this I thought it was an elegant upgrade, but I constantly find myself fumbling in low light or when boarding a train to figure out which earpiece I'm holding. Also a small issue, but annoying."

Unfortunately for me this is the 2nd pair ive recieved that has a defective left earphone. Sound will hiss, cut in and out when i move around. Sometimes i can move my head slightly and find the sweet spot that will completely cut sound out.

This must be a design flaw because ive read up on other shure models, and similar problems happen to others left earbud."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a pair of Shure 835s earbuds. While expensive, they make for wonderful isolation when I fly. the only thing that kept them from being THE perfect headphones was the wire connection to my iPhone. With this bluetooth widget, I have perfection. There is no degradation of the excellent sound quality, they are easy to connect to the earbuds, and no more wires! Ahhh, the bliss of only hearing your favorite music, without getting entangled in the wiring. Perfection!"

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone seems to praise the sound quality and maybe it is just that i haven't listened to too many earbuds lately but the highs seem to be too sharp and tinny for me like a vocal with knife edges they seem to lose the ambience kind of like CD players when they first came out before they started oversampling the music Anyway either they are just not for me or they need to burn in like speakers or I am doing something wrong. They seem to have a good fit. Unless anyone has any ideas i might just return them

So after listening to them a little longer and trying out the different buds and positioning I started to warm up to them some. Not the sound of my Logitech 6000 over the ear which I guess is to be expected but good enough to add a star to my review

Well now they are my choice for music. The Logitech 6000 right speaker went out after 3 days and I returned them"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After going through many sets of ear buds because of build quality issues, it was great to find a set that has had no durability problems 18 months after purchase. The sound isolation is good too.

The sound itself is the only real problem here--while it's decent, it's not thrilling. My Aurvanas had the best sound--clear, balanced, nuanced--out of all my many earbud sets but they suffered the same fate as all the rest. They just didn't last very long. These Shure buds, which replaced the Aurvana set, have been a solid replacement. I just wish they sounded a little more vibrant & alive."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, these things sound great plugged into my phone. Extremely flat response, which makes my musician ears oh so happy. Good sounds stage, clear vocals, a violin sounds like a violin. But... Plug these critters into a real amp or a mixer, and wow! Stunning. Almost as good as a really good pair of over-the-ear ... Without the fatigue. Very happy. Definitely a good value."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these ear buds to use with auto racing. They contour to your ear flush and fit comfortably inside a helmet. Sound is spectacular, as is the noise cancellation (using foam ear inserts, haven't tried the rubber ones yet). If you are riding/driving anything with a helmet and need to hear/communicate with others, or just want to listen to your music/audiobooks in peace without soda cans on your ears, buy these. Buy them. Buy them. Buy them!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to purchasing these I owned the Klipsch S4i's. They lasted me about 2.5 years until the left speaker gave out because the wiring near the plug started break from bending in my pocket.

I purchased these due to the stellar reviews. They sound great, with a little less bass than I'm used to with the Klipsch. I will however be returning these. Reason being that I find the cable thicker than I am used to and the over the ear design does not suit my lifestyle. I use these for commuting on BART and on the computer. I like to take one out at times to be able to hear what's being said over the intercom's and when people are talking to me. If I felt I could afford to have more than one pair of ""nice"" earbuds I would keep these - but for my lifestyle I will be buying a different product."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awkward design: The wire connecting the two earpieces is very long. When running or working out, you'll find that it flops around. It should have been much shorter. There's enough slack to tuck it into the back of your shirt, but it can still flop out for certain exercises.

The wire has two heavy pieces attached to it. This aggravates the wire length issue, as when it flops out of the back of your shirt, it tends to smack you in the side of the face.

Battery issues: The device does not turn off automatically if there's no sound piping to that. You'll have to manually turn it off by pressing and holding on the switch to conserve battery. If you forget to turn it off, you'll find yourself with a low battery. Furthermore, the device seems to take a long time to charge.

Worst of all, when the battery is running low, a voice will interrupt the music or podcast with ""Battery low."" This message repeats over and over again every couple of minutes. The phone has a battery life indicator on it; a persistent warning is not needed. It effectively reduces the battery life of the earphones to be much shorter than it otherwise would be, as you won't be able to stand to listen to the thing when it's constantly interrupting your podcast.

The sound isolation is fine. The sound quality is fine. It would be nice to see a firmware update to fix the low battery warning spam.

Edit 1/5: The battery has completely died. Will not charge. Do not waste your money on this device."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair of earphones is pretty expensive, but if you can afford it, I recommend it 100 percent. As others have said, this pair of earphones, silence the world around you, and I mean completely silence it. This is truly something you need to experience yourself, to fully understand. The music sounds absolutely beautiful, full of detail and exceptional notes, ones you probably have never before. Putting these earphones on, will give the music life, and you new melodies that would be possible with the earphones that came with your phone, and others alike. It is completely worth the price that I paid for it. The earphones are plastic, which is a downside, but it's great that Shure has a reliable warranty. I did break one of the driver's nozzles, and after sending it in (with a form), they replaced it with no questions. Shure just has great service. Again, I recommend this product to anyone, and you really have to use these to appreciate them.

Unfortunately I did end up losing these, (On a flight, as I'd like to believe) but I recommend this nonetheless. It comes with a small bag, nothing special, some extra ear tips, half silicone and the other half foam. I recommend the foam ones, which is the ones I chose to go with.

Once again I highly recommend these earphones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 10 years of using the same in ear isolation monitors for drumming (M-Audio $150 comparable in ear monitors), they finally died. So, I bought the Shure SE215-K's, and I have to say that they isolate way better then the M-Audios. They are very bassy, almost too much, but if you roll off the bottom end a little, they sound great.

4 stars (and not 5) because of the bass issue. Plus the flexible portion of the wire coming directly off the ear piece that you wrap around the top of your ear isn't quite long enough, they would be more comfortable if they were a little longer. And lastly, the little rubber sheath that you can move/cinch up on the L/R wires is very hard to move, almost to the point of risking causing damage to the wire fittings."

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough about these earphones. I am a drummer that made the switch to in-ear monitoring about six months ago and have never looked back. Starting with cheap earbuds and then moving up to a pair of Klipsch S4 earbuds, I have been looking at these for awhile and finally decided to try them out because of the list of nice features they offer for the price. I wish I would have started out with these.
My Klipsch's sounded very good but these blow them away! The bass is unbelievable and the clarity and mix of highs, mids, and lows is perfect IMO. These Shures are so comfortable that I actually forget that I have them in. The way they sit in your ear and the cord comes out the front and goes over the top of the ear makes them look very professional. The replaceable cord is also a huge plus. These are simply great earbuds for either general music listening or an entry level IEM system. I am currently using these with a Behringer 802 mixer, for monitor feeds, and I couldn't be happier. Stop looking and buy these now if you've been thinking about it!"

Bottom line: Waste of money."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a terrible experience with Shure and their customer service. I enjoyed the headphones but they were of a very low quality, failing within 12 months of buying them. They had a 2 year warranty so I sent them in and had them fixed/replaced. I used the replacement set for another 12 months and they failed again. I attempted to return the headphones for a second time but was informed my warranty expired 2-3 weeks before contacting the company. They were used for very light use and as an engineer in charge of quality at a manufacturing company I'd have to say these have a failed design.

Stick to the headphones that come with your iPod or try another manufacturer."

7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these Shure SE 215 a few months ago,and I was looking forward to using these highly rated (by their advertising) earphones.

First of all, the over the ear wiring is cumbersome to use, particularly if you like to just put them on and start listening to music. They take a certain amount of playing with to get them just right, and then they take a fair amount of getting used to. This is not a plus.
Secondly, I thought the music quality was a little tinny and vague, almost like listening in a tunnel, with the music way in the background. I thought it must be me, so recently I did a comparison with all of my earphones, and guess what, these earphones are definitely inferior to many of the earphones out there, which cost less than half as much.

I compared five different sets, with many different music types, and compared the same tracks for each earphone set, to try and be objective. The SE215 performed poorly. I compared a $ 29.00 set of iLuvs, a set of original equipment iPod earphones, a $ 12.00 set of iLuvs, a set of Sharper Image ( about $15.00) and the Shures. The SE 215 were last in the comparison for the reasons I mentioned above, but primarily the sound was far inferior to the others, although the Sharper Image versions were only a little better. By far the two best were the $ 29.00 iLuvs and the original equipment earphones that came with the iPod.

I would definitely say, save your money do not get these SE 215s. I feel that the iLuvs are the best value for the money (of these compared). I also have a pair of Sony noise cancelling earphones, which I did not use for this comparison as I thought that might be an unfair comparison, and those sound really good too.

I understand all of us hear differently, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt, you may hear something I didn't.

Hope someone finds this helpful."

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 6 months of light use. Now the left ear will stop playing music intermittently but come back on if I jiggle the headphones around a little. Annoying for such an expensive product.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a dedicated SHURE listener for several years. My most recent pair was the SE210. Unfortunately they finally fell apart so I decided to upgrade to the 215s. Sadly, almost everything I love about the 210s has been changed for the worse with the 215s.

The biggest reason I fell in love with SHURE at first listen many years ago was the clear articulation of every instrument and voice in my music. Every strum of the guitar, every vocal overtone, every snap of the snare drum was perfectly and crisply rendered. WOW! Now that's a sound worth paying some money for! It was easy to fall in love with that perfection.

But with the 215s, all of a sudden, that crispness is gone... the individual articulation is muddied - the tones, once separate and distinctly recognizable, now bleed into and over each other... this is what I bought SHURE to get away from!

Turns out that in the 210s, Shure used a Balanced Armature design for the micro-speaker. In the 215s they decided to go with a Dynamic Microdriver design. I don't know anything more about those two designs than this: one produces beautiful, articulate sound, and the other is sloppy, indiscriminate, and uninspiring. This is a HUGE step down in quality.

Another reason I loved Shure on first listen is that they didn't blast me with extra bass. Their bass was solid, deep, and expressive, but never over-amped nor overbearing. This too has changed with the 215s; the bass is just overblown now and I had no other choice but to choose the ""Bass Reducer"" profile in my ipod EQ.

I found that getting a secure fit with the earbuds was much more difficult with the 215s as well. Sadly, that was the least of my worries.

After a few days I just couldn't stand it. I wanted to love the 215s, but I had to return them. What a HUGE disappointment."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware. Shure has the worst customer service and warranty on earbuds. just dealt with them on an issue. I will never buy Shure again.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds pretty much only when I cut my lawn. I've been using a pair of jvc in ear buds I bought from wal-mart $20 for years. My wife gave me these shure se-215 noise cancelling earbuds for christmas and I was excited until I used them. The sound was inferior to my cheap jvc earbuds. The highs were way less clear and defined and the bass was non-existant even with the largest foam earbuds they provided with the unit. On top of if all, the plug didn't fit it my phone with any of the 4 cases I have and they are minimalist cases. So every time I used these earbuds with my phone I would have to take the case off. I kept trying to like these because my wife paid so much for them but I just kept going back to my old faithful jvc cheapies. The final straw was when I left my jvc earbuds at work and I had to use these. I dropped my phone from maybe 2 feet while using these, no case because of the stupid plug design, and cracked my screen. I've dropp3d my phone several times before with no issue with the case. I threw them in the garbage because I was tired of trying to like trash because my wife paid waaaayyy to much for this junk."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor bass response, not at all worth the price. Was major disappointment vs equivalent Klipsch models. Mos tother reviewers commented on the lack of bass response as well, but understate how bad it is."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is written by a non-audiophile so a bit of a caveat first of all. I use my headphones primarily with my iphone 4. My old headphones was a Shure SE110 which I used with the MPA-3C music adaptor.

The SE215 was ultimately disappointing. They do sound great. Compared to the SE110 the bass was deeper and the overall sound just seemed more clear, distinct, and richer. However there were several problems that does not make it user friendly:

1)The first problem was evident immediately - the huge plug does not fit in the iphone 4 jack with the Apple Bumper on. I use the my iphone for the gym and on the subway to work so this was a huge problem right away. I had to take off the bumper to even try the headphones. Even without the bumper, the fit was awkward as the plug was L shaped so it juts out from the iphone a little making it hard to put in and out of your pocket.

2) The ear piece is much more angled. I found it much harder to put in your ear and get a proper fit as you have to put it in jussst right. You have to worry about both depth and Lateral placement to get the right fit. The Shure SE110 was much easier as the total shape was similar to an ear plug and inserting the earpiece was exactly like putting in an earplug. Since the SE110 earpiece was shaped more like a pickle, you only had to worry about depth placement.

3) I had ear fatigue from the SE215 after about only 15 minutes. Never had that with the SE110. I think this is because the SE215, due to its angle, is actually touching a lot more of the ear. I did find it easier to rest my head sideways on the couch with them on though as the SE110 jutted out of the ear too much

4) The cord is really long. I mean for years Shure bragged how their cable lengths were modular so you can get the length how you want it. For some reason they turned away from this with the SE215. That makes my perfectly good MPA-3C adaptor completely unusable as a) I then have like 9 feet of cord and b) the microphone and controls are impossibly too far away to be of any use. So if you want to control the iphone from your headphones, you have to spend another $50 for yet another music accessory, the Shure CBL-M+K Music Phone Accessory. (Even if you don't, you have to get it anyway or something similar if you want to use the SE215 with the iphone 4 and bumper)

So very high marks for sound, durability (I've had them for 1 week now but they seem very high quality construction) but I wish I stuck with the SE110 or went with the SE115s instead or maybe tried a different brand entirely for use with my iphone 4.

BTW, I would shop around and do your research before buying headphones as this retailer along with others charge a 15% restocking fee, plus you have to pay for the original ""free"" shipping as well as shipping back to the retailer. So these $99 headphones would have cost me $30+ to return. Instead I opted to get the mobile accessory so I ended up paying $150."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great with few minor complaints.

I just got my Shure SE215 Clear earphones. I immediately tried them and road-tested them. Overall they are awesome except few complaints. I hope this doesn't damper your dream of owning one.

Good: Sound Quality and noise reduction:

Excellent and Awesome. I could hear even the weakest background note clear. Sound is well balanced. The Bass is perfect, not artificially amp'd to give you headache.
These earphones block most of the outside noise. I swear. On the LIRR train ride between my place and Penn station in NYC, I couldn't hear a decibel of outside noise. I couldn't hear the loud station announcement, not the loud chatter of girls sitting next to you, not the train sound. Nada. This was not possible with my old earphones. These are perfect for outdoor listening but watch where you use it (read on)

Bad: Noise reduction:
It blocks way too much noise to be used where you shouldn't be using an earphone - like biking, walking on the street or crossing roads.
Your ears tend to get heavy after an hour of listening. Probably because this earphone blocks most of the noise and all you listen is just music. It just isn't healthy for ears. Take breaks every half an hour to relieve your ear pressure.

Bad: Style & looks:

It takes a little effort to get used to wearing these but they fit perfectly firm. I bought the clear model as I was attracted by the shiny new silver like finsh in the photo. I thought they are a perfect show off but I'm disappointed. The SE215-CL looks much dull than in real-life than in picture. You can't see it unless you open the package. Since these fit in a certain weird way - like around your ear, I have people staring at me in public. Not sure if it is good or bad.

If style and look matters to you, checkout a real life picture of CLEAR and BLACK before purchasing.
Note: B&H photo store in NYC has SE215-CL for $89 ($10 less than black). Don't know why.

Good: Cord:
Cord quality is awesome. It has kevlar coating and unlike rubber I don't think it will break or tear. It is one of the reasons I chose this over Etymotic or Klipsch. And the most convenient thing is that the cord is behind your ears when you wear them and they don't fall in front of your face when you bend down.

Bad: Cord:
It just won't bend as much as the rubber cord does. A really really minor concern.

Overall: Sound quality matters to me more than looks. I just wish they had made the CLEAR ones like shown in the picture. Just saying."

With the foam ear plugs, they do a great job of noise isolation. And the sound they produce is the best of any I've ever tried though I've never paid more than about $150 for buds. Clear highs, and full (enough) bass, with no discernible overemphasis on any range. Took me nearly an hour to figure out how to get them to fit well, and after a few times, they still take some wiggling to get them in right. I won't use them at the gym where I just want to pop in the buds. There, I'll continue to use my Shure e2c's. But I will use them on a plane or at home, where there's time to fiddle. And I can't let this review go by without mentioning how much better these are than the crappy Klipsch S4i buds. Really, like night and day."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You, the review reader, probably need to be reminded that headphones are very subjective.

To start off, if the over ear wire design bothers you, if you care about looking cool with your headphones in, or have really weird shaped ears, I do not recommend these. In fact, I'd even go as far as to say if you are looking purely for sound quality you could probably find some headphones of the same quality for a slightly cheaper price (and that aren't annoying to put on and take off), but these Shures have 2 things really going for them:

1. Durability: The cable is THICK. The part where the wire splits, and the 90 degree jack are both reinforced with an almost dramatic amount of heavy duty plastic, but if you ever somehow damage the wire you can remove the buds and replace the cable (but replacements are expensive so you should still try not to). The only part of them I'm slightly concerned about breaking are the parts where the the rubber tips attach to the plastic tube on the buds. The plastic tubes that are cast as part of the buds aren't too reassuring, but after falling asleep lying on top of them a few times I haven't broken them off yet.

2. Isolation: I'm just a poor high school student whose only source of income is mowing lawns for my neighbors. I wanted some nice headphones, and I justified spending $100 on a pair if I could wear them while mowing. These headphones are perfect for using in loud environments. My lawnmower is very loud. I couldn't tell you how many decibels it is, but it's probably louder than your average lawnmower and with no music they work just as well as those foam earplugs for blocking out noise. At 50% volume I can hear my music very clearly, and at 75% I almost stop noticing the awful noise of the old lawnmower engine and worn out bearings. I don't know why I hadn't thought of this sooner!

As for sound quality, if I'm totally honest, I was a little disappointed with the sound quality of my ""expensive"" headphones on the first day, but after maybe a week or so the range of sound became more broad. I've had them for a few months, but I was waiting to test them while mowing before typing up this review. The quality is very good, in my opinion. They are meant to be used as monitors so the sound is fairly neutral, meaning that they have a good range of sound with no ""boosted bass"" or distortion in the highs that I can detect (again headphones are subjective). But despite not having exaggerated bass, my Beats loving friends were impressed with them listening to their mainstream pop and hip-hop. Also,this may seem like a weird description, but it feels like the sound from the speakers is only in your thoughts,as opposed to filling the air around you. It's not bad in my opinion, but it is different."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These replaced my previous Shure ear buds. I really like the sound these deliver. It took a lot of getting used to the strange way these 215K fit in the ear. Once you get used to the fit, it's actually easier to use these earbuds while lying down on a pillow or something. My only complaints are the fit took awhile to get used to and they get tangled really easily. The left earbud quit working yesterday. There must be a short in the wire. Moderate use, always keep them in their case. The one upside to this is the wires disconnect from the earbuds themselves so I plan on purchasing a replacement if warranty will not cover this."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these as a birthday present about a year ago and just love them. Also currentlyown Beats sports earbuds (the red ones) and the sound on the Shure blows away the Beats. I love the design, the snug fit and the quality of the sound. I hear things I never knew existed in the song! The reason I came on line was to look at upgrading - and am considering the higher end Shure.

I understand the negatives people write about but put it this way - the negatives on these are mere inconveniences - personally, I can't think of a negative. Just buy them and you'll understand. I run an hour at good speed 4 days a week - work up a sweat and have no problems with these (as compared to almost every other ""sport earbud"" I've purchased)."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality exceeds my hopes. The base really helps keep me motivated in the gym when running and cycling. I just hope I don't ruin them from sweating too much. Second pair of Shure earphones in 7 years which is saying alot. Sadly, my first pair got caught in the car door and meet an early grave. Just stands to reason if you take care of them, they should last you awhile."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphones are quality material and quality sound. They're slightly difficult to put on comfortably, but once they're in the sound is amazingly full and crisp. Unfortunately, the right earbud broke within two months but luckily Shure offers a 2-year warranty with the product.

UPDATE: It is now almost three years since I bought these and they still work like new. When the right earbud broke, I shipped it to Shure and they fixed it at no cost. I haven't even changed the interchangeable earbud because they last for a really long time. Most incredible of all, I've forgotten them in the washing machine and the earphones still work great. Highly recommended, it's worth the $100 investment for these quality earbuds."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! I got these for a recording session to try to block out the stage noise so that I could clearly distinguish what was coming from the sound board. They block out all of the ambient noise that isn’t coming directly from them. I am sitting about 20 feet from the musicians playing acoustic guitars, acoustic violin, trumpet, cajone, acoustic piano with only a standard interior door separating us and I don’t hear a thing that these are not directly producing."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first IEMs that I have purchased for myself. I've heard a few others, S4s, Beats, Turbines, and these by far out-perform those in my opinion.

I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I do love precise sound with good clarity and balance/neutrality. These have just enough bass for my taste, not too little, not too much. The sub-bass could have more impact, but it is a minor complaint. Lows are accurate and do not get muddy. Satisfying. Mids are splendid, clear and warm. Highs can fall off a little bit, but they're still good. Sound-stage is wide for a single dynamic driver. Using this with a HiFiMeDIY Sabre USB DAC and a Electric Avenues PA2V2 portable amp.

Comfortable and I'm using the medium foams. I had no problem putting them in or any discomfort. Used them for lifting weights today and had no issues. The cord is a little heavy but it doesn't bother me at all, I guess it is a complaint for some?

They look alright, not the best looking around but not ugly by any means. (I have the SE215-K [black])

The case is nice and simple, and the warranty is a nice 2 year.

Came in great condition in the box, not even a small scratch or dent on the box.

Can't complain, these are wonderful!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
-Wireless means I can ditch the tether to the phone, which works well for me
-Seems to retain the same quality as corded version
-Can control volume and track via controller, as well as integrated mic

Cons:
-mic is often muffled and the caller cannot hear me well, quality lacking
-The collar clip broke after exactly two months of careful use

Regarding the collar clip, I called Shure today to ask for a replacement. Their reply was, ""Sorry but this is not a part that comes w/ the RMCE-BT1, but we can send you the clip for the wired version, EAC64BK."" After explaining it absolutely does come with the set, I was transferred to somebody else who I left a message with. I'm yet to hear back, but as of now, it is unacceptable that a) the clip broke after two months of light use b) that Shure's own parts department can't locate a simple clip that does in fact come with the headphones. Until I can get this resolved my review will stay at one star. Please make this right Shure. I've spent hundreds of dollars on your products to date."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is THE BEST monitoring in-ear earphones for the price!
Even tho caging of earphone is plastic, it doesn't look cheap at all.
The materials used were not cheap or lame.
It is legit earphone not only for monitoring but also for enjoying the music.
It's got high quality sound. The treble, mid and bass are evenly divided and they are super clear.
The sound isolation is the best and fit is super comfortable.
I have beats by dr. dre Tour and Solo, and for the comparison, I would say Shure SE215 is better even though it's much cheaper.
I strongly recommend this earphone for those who are looking for a pair quality earphone with $100 budget."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what you expect from Shure products! I've been performing for 6 years and I always have had issues with floor monitors. I got the chance to afford my 1st set of in-ears monitor 3 years ago and of course I got the SE215 CL. I loved them since the beginning! I jump a lot onstage and normally perform wearing one earplug and the other one around my neck. Due to this the one that is loose around my neck is normally bouncing from one side to another. After 3 years of doing that, one of the earplugs got damaged and It wasn't properly working. That's why I got a new pair a few weeks ago and as expected they work awesome! Totally recommended!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I wanted something for cutting the grass and didn't want to spend a lot of money or have a Bluetooth or power pack for headphones. These are great and I love how they fit my ears. I listen to podcasts while mowing and can hear with crystal clarity what they are saying and only hear the mower if I focus on it. Also, no battery pack like others since this is a passive noise canceling ie: the fit of the piece and foam inserts. Easily one of the best purchases made!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent but both the cable and the replacement cable I bought ended up failing.

The first cable had a faulty plug. The headphones only played sound if the plug was turned to a specific angle. The second pair failed on the actual cable. The part of the cable near the earpiece which bends around your ear became sensitive as well. If it was in the wrong position it wouldn't allow sound through.

Great headphones, awful cables."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an updated review of Shure SE215 headphones, which I purchased in 3.5 years ago. I have been using them since then for running and general use. I revised my rating to 5 starts, and am updating this review since the original posting. These headphones turned out to be among the best investments I made.

Sound quality: is very good, surely not exceptional, but for the price they sound amazing, with no blown bass, and quite clear throughout the range. Since buying these headphones, I listened multiple times to Bose or Beats headphones, and keep wondering why people invest so much money into those? After trying several alternatives, including the one listed below, I found the SE215 to provide the most pleasant sound, without distortions.

Durability: one of the main reasons for this update is how superbly durable these headphones are. I have ran more than 1,500 miles in them, though rain, cold, snow, and hot (sweaty) weather. While they are not advertised as sports headphones, they surely perform as such. Never had any problem, and thanks to the ear-hooks design, they stay secure through the whole marathon distance, without dislodging.

Sound isolation: the included foam tip provides an excellent sound isolation. I use them on long flights, and have been very happy over the years. While I never used the active noise-cancelling headphones, these headphones have been always more than enough to provide sufficient noise reduction for a comfortable sleep,

In summary, I highly recommend these as a multi-purpose, good fidelity headphones, especially for running/exercises.

Original Review: Relatively happy, much better than Sennheiser CX 685 which had worse quality sound. Still this is no match to my Denon AHD1001S, in terms of depth of sound and fidelity, but still pretty decent sound across different music styles. I use them for running, and they stay quite fit for the first 30 minutes, but then start to slide when get sweaty, so need to keep readjusting. Overall good value."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the SE215 after my old SE115 broke (after 6 years of use). I was very pleased to find that the new SE215 is at the same price as the old SE115. I primarily use this for commuting, working out, etc., when audio fidelity isn't as critical as noise cancellation. This is significantly better than the SE115, and I assume the SE112 (since 115 and 112 are the same); it's better in that the bass range is better, and the higher notes are clearer. They are very comfortable to wear, and it's quiet enough on planes that I can't hear the engine noise at all.

Now, comparing this to the significantly more pricey SE425, I would say that the SE215s offer about 90% of the sound quality/fidelity than the SE425 set. I've owned the SE425 line for a while, and I reserve that for when I'm working at home; the SE425 is really more suitable for classical music and jazz when you want more clarity to hear every little detail. I would say that if you really want a pair of quality headphones that will make the world silent and the music pleasant, the SE215 is a very good deal.

Compared to other headphones like the Etymotic HF5 set (which I also own), this is significantly better at noise reduction, as well as clarity of sound. The rubber ear sets also last way longer on the Shures for any set.

The cord does not tangle easily, and quite frankly is cheap to replace if you damage them or if your cat/dog chews on them. That's another advantage over the SE115/2 set this SE215 has -- you can replace the cord and keep the earphones. Very good investment if you damage your cords more than once a year.

Take note, however, that you cannot drop, knock, or throw these around like you would a cheaper set of earphones -- the drivers do get damaged if you do that; they will burn out. I had that happen with my SE425 set a year ago, and the cost to fix was over 50% of the original purchase price. Take care of these, and they will serve you well!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect headphones for playing on my worship team. They hook behind my ears and have really great sound. I needed better headphones for the weekend worship sets but didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars. These were recommended by my production friend, and are great.
If you're needing better headphones for worship team, and you use Avioms or wireless transmitters for the band, these work fabulously."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a professional musician I’ve come to rely on the quality of Shure products and this headset with its exceptional sound quality delivered. The foam earpiece attachments are varied in size to ensure a nice snug fit.

I can safely say I may never purchase anything other than Shure ever again."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215s are some amazing little headphones for $99. The sound Isolation is above and beyond what I could have ever asked for. even at low I can not hear hardly anything. I have burned these in over the last week and I feel the bass has tightened a bit but still has a nice punch to it. The mids and highs are there but I could ask for more. I want to upgrade to the se535s already as have triple the drivers would really help with sound quality across the board. Understandably these are $99 dollar buds, so for the price these are some of the best bass headphones around. The around the ear design really helps with the isolation and bass reproduction, however it will take a day or two to get used to. As I have had these a little over a week I have put the rounds through these things and can say the durability is very nice. We will see in the next few months if they have problems like a few others have had but as of now I simply cant think of another ear bud in this price range I could recommend over these.

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having had many sets of headphones that were good, but not great - they each lacked something: Sony - too bassy; Sennheiser, good, but distorted sometimes and lacked midrange and the bass sometimes was too bassy like the Sonys; Shure SCL2s - never had enough bass and stuck out of my ears, so I couldn't put my head against a pillow or airplane seat; Shure SCL3s - better sound, slightly better bass, but still couldn't rest my head on a pillow. Enter the Shure SE215s..... Very well balanced sound - I had to turn off my iPod EQ to get tonal balance (excellent sign for the headphones) and strong, but not overwhelming bass came through. midrange is also strong and the treble doesn't blow your ears away. I can finally rest my head on a pillow!!! They fit snugly and I think the wraparound wire makes sense and is comfortable. I can listen to these headphones for hours without discomfort and finally feel I got my bang for the buck. Now, what to do with all those other duds that came before.....?"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these and had them for 4 years. The sound and noise-cancelling on these are excellent. I would have rated them a 5-star because the cable is absurdly long. It's annoying when you work out with these. I use them all the time, and keep the case clipped to my backpack. The loop that attaches the clip to the case is flimsy. Somehow mine lasted 4 years, but it was ""gone"" this past weekend. A $100 paid of earbud deserves a sturdier case.... Oh well."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received the cables today and I and am pleased with how easy it is to sync to my iPhone to my SE425. The sound is solid. No regret with my purchase. I did not want to get another set of earbuds since I love my shure earbuds.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones as a gift for my younger son for Christmas. I was originally looking at the Klipsch S4 Image (which are also good earphones), but was fortunate to find these on a Black Friday Sale for under $90 - less than $10 more than the Klipsch, so I opted to go with them. I'm ""old school"" when it comes to quality of construction and weigh it heavily when making purchase decisions. These fit the bill, and are much sturdier than the Klipsch. I, myself, own a pair of SE425 and have been extremely pleased with the performance, and since I gave these SE215s to my son on Christmas, he's commented numerous times on how happy he is with their fit and performance. Do the research, and I believe you'll find this is a worthy contender for your hard-earned $$$ - especially when you can get near $200 earphones for less than half the price!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's clear that the attachment points between the earpiece and the cord degrade over time and cause some cutting in and out of the audio. This can get very annoying, and I will update this review when I buy a new cord and try them again.
The sound is absolutely great, though, and they do a nice job of isolating you from the noise of the outside world. I use them regularly on wingsuit skydives, and I get a little wind noise but my tunes sound nice!

Despite my limited experience with other brands, I'd say these will beat the rest at similar price points. Second pair of higher end Shure IEMs and I'll keep buying them despite the little snag with the cord..."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start off the review, I would like to put a disclaimer in that I am not an audiophile in any way. What I'm about to say is based off of my experience and what may be good will be considered negative to other users. Please bear in mind that not everyone will have the same hearing you do so with that said let the review begin.

I reviewed the HAFX101 headphones and pretty much convinced myself not to purchase any earphones that cost above a 100 due to the sound quality that those earphones gave off. I thought ""why need to spend a ridiculous amount of money just to get ""high end"" item when you can buy multiple earphones and have backups for you in the event that you break them"". I was definitely wrong and being really ignorant. I just purchased these . I'm going to admit, these earphones are amazing. Of course, I wouldn't know what the other high end earphones are like since these are my first time purchasing high end (many of you will probably not consider this high end so I apologize for calling them an upper tier, bear with me for a bit) earphones and NOT HEADPHONES and the difference between these and the HAFX101's make it distinguishable day and night. I'm hearing things that I don't normally hear especially with my old HAFX101 and on top of that they even make my Bose Soundtrue headphones very underwhelming. The high's are very warm and not screechy, bass isn't muddled (thank the sound gods) and audible, mids are strong and clear with again details that I've never heard with my other earphones. Even at lower hearing volumes you can still hear each and every distinct sound and instrument that you can find (I have sensitive hearing so I usually play songs at 2 - 4 volume and sometimes 5 but no more than that on the Note 4. I preferably play at 3 because I like playing for hours on end). On top of that you have MODULAR SET of earphones and what I mean by module is that you can seperate the actual earphones from the cables just as you can see in the pictures presented in the product page which means, if you ever break your cables you don't have two buy a new pair. All you have to do is buy a replacement cable and your set and you also have a 2 year warranty from shure so if anything ever happens to your pair then just mail them in and your good to go for a brand new set (just as long as you follow their policy for warranty then you should be in good hands with Shure).

The one thing I'm a tad bit concerned is how you change the earpieces on the earphones. It feels like your yanking out the whole assembly and I'm the type of person that is OCD about keeping things in good condition. Seeing that, I decided to remove the memory foams (I'm comfortable with the silicone tips) and decided to never remove the pieces again. The way you place these inside your ears is something your going to have to get used to and I found myself struggling for a couple of minutes just to be able to put these earphones in both of your ears. One more thing that is just a personal issue of mine (not sure if anyone else hear feels the same way) but I just wished that the earphones themselves (not the cables) we're made of some type of metal like the RHA T10i (which I might purchase as a collection of earphones). It would've been icing on the cake to have had these made out of metal but that's just a personal preference.

At the end of the day, I still give these 5 stars due to it's design, functionality, and most of all it's sound quality and as to the people who are wondering.... why in the world am I giving it 5 when I was able to find a good amount of negatives that came along with it. Well..... again it depends on a person's experience with their earphones and honestly, all those things the I listed are OUTWEIGHED by the positives that are presented in these earphones. With that said, this has nothing but a joy to my ears and to the purchasing price and for a 100 bucks, you can't go wrong with these earphones. I probably will give an update on how these earphones are but so far, I'm really happy with my purchase and do I want to venture out and see all the other great earphones available, why yes I do. Many more reviews to come and this is just one of those reviews (a very satisfying review)."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these looking for a new pair of IEM's (in-ear monitor) and I found the perfect ones. I can't quite afford brand such as Ultimate Ears (starting at $300 for a decent pair) or JH Audio (starting at $400) but these are on par. The sound quality is better than my Bose earphones and they fit better too. They have no business sounding this good for the price. I wanted something that fit perfectly and were hard to see on stage. I bought the I-MEGO Ztone at the same time because I liked the design, but the sound wasn't even close to comparable. These should cost $250-$300 but for only $97 they are fantastic.

Pros: Crystal clear perfect sound, fit is great, moldable ear hooks, interchangeable ear insert, removable cable (allowing for longer life), compares to IEM's costing hundreds more, perfect mix of bass mid and high.

Cons: Only two choice's of colors (I would've loved gold) ear pieces are tough to get off.

UPDATE: After I bought the IEM's, I found out my entire band for church uses these earphones. No one had complaints. Everyone loved the sound, feel, and especially the quality for the money."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these for 2 hours minimum per day. They fit nicely and stay secure without much fiddling. I will backup a few other reviews I've seen about them being difficult to fit the first few times you use them. the cable that attaches directly to the monitor is stiff and is meant to fold around the top of your ear and come down behind it.

Once you get them fitted and know how to put them on, they are amazing. I would easily say these are the best headphones I've had in a LONG time."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of IEMs. So, factor that in as you see fit. That being said, I have played two gigs with these and have been quite happy with them. My budget was limited, but I feel like I definitely picked a quality product for the money spent. I understand the limitations of a single driver system, but luckily this band's sound guy is an expert with in-ear technology and provided a very clean feed that I can mix myself through my iPad. These IEMs fit snugly around my ears, fit well inside my ears, and are comfortable all night long. Again, I am relatively new to working like this (I'm a middle-aged drummer accustomed to using monitor wedges), but I'd recommend these. If nothing else, you'll have a relatively inexpensive set of IEMs as a backup. :P Seriously though, I suspect you could find a much worse pair of IEMs."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum On-Ears which are fantastic, but was looking for something a little more portable. These earphones are great! I've had them for almost two weeks and the sound is phenomenal - bass is just enough and doesn't overwhelm the mids and the highs a just right. This is what I would classify as a warm sounding set, which is a signature that I find most pleasant across the music genres I like to listen to - rock, classical, new age, & trance, among others . While the foam tips are great, I ended up using Klipsch S4 tips that I had laying around as they fit my ears perfectly and are are extremely comfortable. If the included tips quite don't feel right, go get these - this is the only reason why I gave this a 4 star instead of 5, but hey, Klipsch has a patent on their tips. The over the ear was a little awkward at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and the body ""snaps"" into the bowl of the ear very easily and ensures a good solid fit. The noise isolation is great, do not use these to run or ride your bike. The cable is thick, sturdy, and essentially free of microphonics. Overall, I am very pleased and see myself having these for a long time."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have small ears so finding a really good pair of earbuds that fits my ears is not easy so I was very happy with these. They fit into the cavity of my small ears and the wires are bendable and stiff so they keep their shape. This means that I can basically fit the main part into the cavity of my small ears and mold the stiff wires over my ears to keep everything in place. Fantastic. The sound is also really excellent. I love that the wires are changeable as I've had Sony and two Sennheiser's before and each lasted about 2 years with the wires being the weakest link. With these, if the wires go, you can just buy new wires and screw them in.

It lost 1 star because mainly for the instructions of putting them into your ears. It's a bit tricky to put in at first and it seems to be getting easier with time but it's been a few months and I still find myself fumbling. If the instructions were better I'd know if it's my method that's totally wrong or if it really just takes time."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's nice to hear good staging and clear mids from earphones in this price range. The bass is present, fully represented without exaggeration. I can hear reverb and vocal nuances I have been missing with cheaper headsets. I wanted a clear and neutral sound, and that's what I got.

A few notes for smartphone users, the jack is right-angled, and very thick. As a result, it would not plug into my phone with the TPU case on. I fixed this by using a x-acto knife to open the hole in the case a bit. If you buy the android/ios headset accessory with mic/buttons, be aware that the cable provided is not as good as the original, and won't wrap behind the ears easily."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok corny title but I had to do it. Everyone needs to find their sound. I found them in shure headphones. These are by far the best balanced in ear headphones I have heard. I have tried Sennheiser MM50, Klipsch image s4, Apple in-ear headphones, and my Shure ec2 (R.I.P.) headphones. Nothing to me compares to shure headphones. The sound is so crisp and clean compared to the others. MM50 sounded muddy and did the apple in-ears. S4's sounded very tinny (hurt my ears on the high end) Shure headphones have none of that. Tight bass, good highs, and maybe you can make an argument the mid range is lacking a bit but that shortcoming is quick overcome with the overall sound quality. Like my older ec2 (which I used a few times a week before they died 6 years later) the new SE 215 did not disappoint."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this product for about 6 months and the performance has been consistent throughout
I also own a pair of bose mie2i earphones, and in my opinion the shure 215's have more acoustic merit

Pros
good sound isolation
very good sound quality: very solid bass that balances well with treble;
with noise isolation it creates a well-rounded listening experience
appears as in picture- people will notice the unconventional design
earbud covers come in several sizes and in foam earplug-like material (for better sound isolation) as well as conventional rubber

Cons
although the cord is extremely thick and resilient, the detaching mechanism, despite the good intentions
of giving you the capability of replacing faulty wires without having to replace the drivers, seems fairly temperamental.
After about 5 months of regular but cautious use, I noticed in the middle of listening to something the right driver had ceased to function
However, after fiddling with it slightly, the sound came back on. After further inspection and several other occurrences, I think the problem
has to do with the connection between driver and cord because it starts working again when I rotate the driver around the socket a certain way

Once this issue presented itself, I started using them only at home so as to avoid further stressing the connection.
The reason I'm writing this review half a year after purchase is because I just picked them up after several weeks of not using them,
and the acoustic difference between shure and bose has struck me so much I decided to write this"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried Ultimate Ears 600, Sennheiser MM50, and Bose IE2 in-ear/earbuds and these Shure SE215-K headphones (Live Sound Monitor) are by far the best. The Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable, but they just rest in the cup of your ear where the foam tips on these do a much better job of blocking out external noise and transmitting sound. That means the quality of the music really shines through. I'd like to balance this review out with some more cons, but ""the Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable"" is as close to a negative as you're going to find here.

The first thing I noticed out of the box was how well-built the cord is. All the above products had issues with frayed cords in the span of about 9-12 months. I've only had these about two months so it's not a totally fair comparison yet, but I can't see them falling apart any time soon.

The second thing I noticed was how fantastically awesome they sounded. I put on my Classical for Work Radio from Pandora and immediately heard details in the highs and the subtleties of play that I haven't heard in any headset since my beloved Bose triports.

It's a bit of trial and error finding the right size tips to use for comfort and sound. Fortunately they include small, medium, and large tips in both rubber and foam. The rubber tips seem to have a softer feel than the foam, but they tend to make my ears sweat a bit more, so I stick with the foam tips. The foam tips do a wonderful job of regulating temperature for me. I wear these pretty much all day at work, to the gym, and on into my evening reddit/youtube browsing and I find the only time I have to take them out is to participate in conversation, never for discomfort. Don't be afraid to mix and match sizes--I found I get the best sound and comfort when I use a large on the left side and a medium on the right.

Finally, the padded case provided in the package is fantastic. Mine came with a little carabiner which makes it a simple thing to clip on and carry with. It also has a tidy little inside pocket for carrying the extra tips and the included cleaning tool.

All in all, if you're on the fence about purchasing these, I'd encourage you to just do it. I love these headphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through a ton of headphones, and I have always gone back to the Shure brand. The comfort is supreme, and it has a decent balance between treble and bass!

Now with these being $100, they are definitely a bargain beat up everyday headphone!

01/20/16 - UPDATE
My old SE115 didn't have the detachable earbuds. When I firs purchased this product, I thought it was a godsend that I can replace the wire whenever. The trade off is the fact that the earbud can become loose from the wire and you can lose the earbud."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as I read one ""In Ear Monitor's comparison chart"" in Head-Fi.org and these were among the top (in regards of sound quality) in the sub 100$ price range. I am glad I did that research.

Isolation is simply impressive, really helpful when flying. Sound quality out-of-the-box is also outstanding. They are very balanced. I compared them to my full-size Sennheiser HD-595 which I find very detailed and balanced (probably lacking a little bass) and the Shure 215 come close (to my ears) in sound quality.

I would recommend them for musicians. This is a design most drummers and other instrument players would appreciate.

On the other hand, they may not be comfortable and practical for most people. It takes time to get used to wear these, and also taking them in or out of your ears requires some effort and a few seconds, so I wouldn't recommend them for people who need something easy to remove and put back in quickly. If you are at work and somebody comes to talk to you, these will not come out as easy as many other ""earphones"" and you will need also to spend some time putting them back in the right way.

But I find it good enough for protection purposes."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are good at isolating outside noise and great at producing clean audio - no complaints there. However, despite being very careful about always storing these in the provided soft-sided case, the rubber coating on the wires has started to wear off, exposing wires. I don't expect these to last much longer which is too bad. I expected a much longer lifetime of use at this price point and from this brand. Not sure if this situation is typical or an exception, but either way, I'm uncertain if I would recommend them or ever purchase something from Shure again."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're a fan of warm sounding music these earbuds are not for you. They have excellent imaging, excellent mids, and decent highs, but in my opinion do not accentuate the bass frequencies enough, and as a result sound a little bit tinny to someone like myself who enjoys music with a little warmth. As a reference point I'm using my Sennheiser Momentum over ears which are the sweetest sounding closed ear headphone I have heard. When I listen to both headphones back to back the Sennheisers blow these out of the water.
I will say that the build quality on these Shures is outstanding and the sound isolation is the best I've seen. I have a hard time hearing people with just one earbud in."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first headphones in this price range. They're better than my old favorite, the sony mdr-60ex. Bass is amazing. They are very comfortable. They are also possible to wear when trying to sleep sideways. I use them while doing homework, working out, and well just everything. The ONLY thing I don't like is that the cable is rather long.

two year update: The cable one time and I was able to get it replaced through Shure's warranty. Another time I dropped something heavy on the right earpiece and broke it. Again, Shure warranty came through and replaced it... no questions asked. The warranty alone made this worth the price"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These truly live up to the Shure name - excellent sound, excellent isolation, balanced sound , truly thumpy bass, excellent cable build, little/no microphonics, superb and sturdy connectors.

Since i said thumpy bass, let me clarify, this is an overall performer at all bands - low to high, though much better at handling low frequency than highs, having said that it will produce clear highs and mids and one shouldn't notice.

I listen to a wide range of music : from blues to progressive metal, classic rock, electronic minimal, psybient and some hip hop. In none of the genres i felt these earphones did a less than admirable job ( obviously the source should be either lossless or 320kbps bitrate files) . One of the winners is the excellent isolation it will give you, its almost soundproof and you wont hear any external sounds when they are on ( comes with a ear buds of various sizes and shapes, foam and silicon)

The only hitch may be encountered while getting used to them, they go over the ears and that may take some time to get used to but hey, you better do if you want aural pleasure.

Highly recommended to any audiophile who takes their music seriously."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These take a little bit of figuring out the first time you put them on, but after that, you get to enjoy great sound quality and isolation. With the headphones in and no music, outside sounds are reduced, but not quite as much as you might expect. (I suspect the brain compensates and raises the apparent volume.) However, once you put music on even at a volume of 10% or so, that's all you will hear. And it will sound great. These are not bass heavy headphones, they have a balanced sound good for everything from pounding electronica to Irish traditional.

Update 4 years in:
Still love these, still going strong with the original cable. I also use an aftermarket MCMX cable from Yinyoo that provides a shorter cable, with microphone, pause button, and jack that will fit into most phone cases better than the original."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i'm a producer, and these are my go-to when i don't have my m50xs on me! really like that it comes w/ multiple tip types + sizes and that it comes w/ a carrying case w/ JUST enough room for tips and an extra cable. unfortunately, the cable can deteriorate after about a year, so you'll have to shell out some $ for a $15+ replacement cable."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the SE115 and SE210 earbuds. I lost the 115's and decided that the SE215 was for me based on my excellent experience with Shure. They definitely are an upgrade in audio quality but not enuf to offset the discomfort I felt in my outer ear after wearing them for a couple of hours. I tried wearing them for extended periods of time on several occasions with the same result and regrettably, I had to return them. The 210's are still great earbuds so I won't lose any sleep over not being able to keep the 215's. Just somewhat disappointed. But on the upside... I found my 115's so all's well that ends well."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decided on a pair on buds instead of active noise cancelling after reading the reviews of this product.

I must agree with some that getting used to this product takes some time! I've usually used earbuds and it still took a while for me to establish a comfortable fit with the Shures. The cables are indeed on the stiff side and require some manipulating into a comfortable position. There was only some slight cable noise when you move the cables when i first started using them, but eventually got around this. Removal of the foam plugs i thought was difficult and i was worried about damaging them. I wouldn't change these out frequently IMO.

However the sound quality in fantastic esp after a burn in. Music is better, esp uncompressed and IMO the movie audio reproduction is even more improved.

I have yet to try them out with the TASCAM and RP500 DSP but im sure they will be much better than what i'm used to now.

Trick is you definitely have to spend some time getting used to the feel and also getting used to using them very deep into the ear canal."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall these earphones are pretty good. After spending some time with them, I feel like I can give a decent opinion about them. The sound quality is pretty good. Although I am not an expert and I haven't experimented with a lot of headphones/earphones, these headset definitely had better quality of sound compared to others. I was able to notice more details in my music that I never really noticed before. The length of the earphones is a great feature in my opinion. The style is nice as well. There are only a couple problems. The earphones block out the majority of sound but not all. If you are traveling with someone who plays their music medium to high volume you will hear it, which is implied by its name as it does not advertise ""noise-canceling"". Not really a problem but I just kind of want to mention that. The real problem is trying to put them on and possibly the fit of the ear phones. I have to spend a couple more seconds to put them and after using them for awhile (1 and 1/2 or 2 hours) my ears begin to hurt a little. Not a deal breaker as they seem to be durable and have great sound."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones and they have both been incredible. I will say that these are a pain to put in, but they stay in place well for me (after I found the right ear pieces) and sound great. I really like that the cord can be separated from the actual earphone, as my first pair of Shure headphones shorted out after over a year of daily use; the drivers sounded great until the day they died, but the cord had simply had enough. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting a great pair of earphones for a reasonable price; you won't be disappointed!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m on my second pair of these. They’re not so expensive that I don’t want to wear them out and about. I wear them at work nearly every day and they double as my hearing protection.
They’re also surprisingly clear on stage. I’ve used them for 6 years now and will use them until they’re dead."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to work in the Production Arts world, and have been a Shure fan for many years. For running I had used Shure E2C for almost a decade. I had the same pair the whole time, running dozens of races, dragging through almost two years of abuse in Iraq and still they kept on. Finally they shorted out and I sadly went looking for a replacement. I gave the SE 215's a try. Within a month the mount on one ear broke. I paid for shipping, sent it off to Shure, their customer service was great, they fixed it and sent it back for free. A month later they broke again. I guess I could send them off again, still under warranty, but no desire. My faith in these things is lost, and I will be trying to find something better to keep up with my lifestyle."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to use as my monitors for the cover band I play in. The sound is great when you get the right tips on the ear buds, plenty of bass and I'm a bass player so that was important. The price was certainly right on this product for what you get. If I had to say one thing negative about them is they don't fit perfectly, but I didn't purchase custom fit buds so there ya go.

All in all a great product I would recommend to any musician looking for affordable in-ear monitors."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from the Klipsch S4 earphones which got a short in the cord. I was attracted to these because of their reputation but also because of the replaceable cords--which is very nice for this price range.

The earphones are a little heavier than the S4 but fit very nicely and block out sound MUCH better (I'd say at least 1/3 more sound is blocked out). Due to the wrapping over the ear, the Shure don't get too heavy. I was immediately impressed with the better sound quality and bass (and this is even before breaking in the speaker). Used Phil Collins ""In the air tonight"" as the initial test and really sounded great!

Key to these is getting the right fitting ear cushions. After that, just enjoy the music!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these to replace old pair of Shure E2c headphones - those old headphones were one of the best tech purchases I have ever made.

The sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort on Shure headphones is hard to beat. I travel a lot, and work in a noisy environment. I use these for many hours every day.

My old pair finally wore out (in fact, when I had problems before, I sent them to Shure, and they sent me a brand new pair - kudos to their excellent customer service). The part that wore out on my old pair, was the cable that connects the phone to the wire (at the ear), and on this revision - they have re-engineered this to not fail (with the detachable connection).

I have had the new pair about 5 months, and have liked them as much as my beloved old pair.

Kudos to Shure for putting out a great product, and a reasonable price point."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a pro at judging audio quality on headphones. I upgraded to these from the Creative EP-630i and I have to say these are awesome! They block out so much sound I could use them on the airplane as earplugs to fall asleep. Not good for crossing roads though!

I wear them around the top of the ears like other reviewers and I like how the stress areas of the cables are kevlar-reinforced for extra durability. The cables are also completely replaceable so nevermind if you break, fray or cut them accidentally.

Tip: These earphones aren't as translucent as the photos show them to be. They do look cool though, I'd give you that."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start with the most important thing: yeah, these sound really, really good. Highs and mids are clear and distinct. Layers of sound appear that you just can't hear with stock earbuds. The bass rumbles, thumps, rolls and menaces when it should. I've had various pairs of Etymotics, Sennheisers, and Ultimate Ears at this price point, and these destroy them all - especially for bass. On tracks like ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""Harder Better Faster Stronger,"" these earbuds will move you.

They come with plenty of extra tips, a cleaning tool, and a really nice case. The cord is detachable and replaceable - a very nice touch, considering how often the cord fails on earbuds. The one downside is the over-the-ear cable, which is a little annoying, but you'll get used to it."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds may not be for everyone, and using them has some drawbacks, but after going through several sets of buds over the last few years I had some clear goals for my next set, and the Shure SE215 met those goals. Durabilty is my primary goal for this latest purchase, but only time will tell if these earbuds are durable. But that is how I became interested in the SE215, because I found it recommended on several Net review sites listing durable buds. They have a detachable cable, and the cable is probably where most earbuds eventually fail, although it isn't always clear where the failure occurs. Usually, I just hear that one side starts cutting out or goes dead completely. Unfortunately, replacement cables for these are as expensive as a cheap set of buds, but even with regular cable replacement, the cost of ownership of these buds may turn out to be less than frequently replacing cheaper sets.

One thing that people may want to know about this product is that it was apparently designed as an in-ear monitor for musicians and not necessarily an earbud designed for use with an iPod or cell phone, although that is probably how most people use it. As such, it has several design characteristics that are different from most earbuds. There are no flashy colors or aggressive shapes. The cable is comparatively long, and it lacks the rubbery flexibility of other earbud cables. The base model also lacks in-line controls, although a model with inline controls is available at extra cost. I opted for the base model without inline controls and bought an aftermarket cable that has the controls. The combination is about the same cost as the one with inline controls but I get two cables instead of one.

In use, the SE215 is the best sounding and most comfortable set of buds I have ever owned. Some people describe the sound as bass heavy, but I only found that to be the case if the sleeves are of the silicone flange variety and are very tight fitting. In my experience, these buds are best used with the compressible foam style of sleeves, and I am currently using the largest set of these that came with the set. The compressible foam sleeves tend to de-emphasize bass, as well as being more comfortable. With the foam sleeves, I would characterize the sound as balanced, but still with excellent bass. I have no doubt that a big part of the perceived sound quality of the SE215 is due to its sound isolating qualities. Without some degree of sound isolation, the listener simply won't hear a lot of detail and nuance in the sound. The best comparison I can make is that using the SE215 is close to the experience of using a good set of over the ear head phones. That is high praise, but over the ear head phones are also designed for sound isolation, hence the similarity. Because of the sound isolation and the detail that comes through in the music, the experience of using these buds is immersive and strangely addictive. Using the SE215 has become my favorite way of listening to music.

These buds are also the most comfortable I have ever used, especially for long listening sessions. They don't fall out easily because of normal body movements like walking, and because of the over the ear cable routing, small tugs on the cable don't yank them out either. The downside is that getting the buds properly inserted and the cable properly routed is a fiddly and time consuming process. Because of the detachable connector, the cable rotates freely on the earbud and everything has to be held in just the right position to get them properly placed. Another small quibble is that the set does not come with a cable clip. I had to scavenge one from one of my dead earbud sets. This is an omission that should be rectified.

It remains to be seen if I can list durability as Pro instead of a Con, but here is my Pro and Con summary of the SE215:

Pros
- Sound isolation and sound quality make for an immersive listening experience
- Nice bass, but not too heavy as some others claim
- Very comfortable for long listening sessions
- Replaceable cable
- Once properly placed, they tend to stay put

Cons
- Price
- Getting inline controls for portable devices is an additional cost
- Fiddly earbud placement and cable routing
- Stiff cable
- Lack of a cable clip"

Use these on my street bike under my helmet and they are awesome. They are snug so doesn’t hurt my ears with my helmet and noise cancelling so on the highway all I hear is music. Would deff recommend if looking for headphones for helmet."

That is what our son told me after we purchased these ""AWESOME"" ""SICK"" in ears for his birthday. He put us to the test as we sat around the living room and he closed his eye with these in his ears...we all yelled, spoke loudly and he didn't flinch or hear a thing...only the music playing in his ears. They fit perfectly and he has informed us that even if the cable breaks, it is an inexpensive fix. He was so pleased with these. He will use them with the sound systems at various locations where he preforms. A must have for your musical teen!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been on the market for some high-quality earbuds ever since my last pair of Bose earbuds got mutilated after about 4 months of use. I am a very active person with an appreciation for high-quality sound, as I spend every day listening to music. I listen to music when I bike, run, lift weights, ride the bus, and when I can't sleep. Because of this, I needed to find a durable pair of earbuds without sacrificing sound quality. When I saw that the Shure SE215-K earphones were half price at $100, they immediately caught my attention. I read the numerous reviews and waited about 1-2 months before making the final decision to buy them.

Sound:
I am no audiophile, but I can vouch for these being the most crisp-sounding and consistent headphones I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my ears. The bass does not drown out the percussion and other subtle sounds, and you can hear every detail the artist put into the song. I primarily listen to metal music, and the precision of the sounds is amazing. Also, these sound amazing when you are running or biking. They cancel out all outside commotion and really allow me to get in my zone. Just be careful if you're in a situation where you need your hearing, because you won't be able to hear anything except the music that is playing. It is amazing how consistent the sound is across all volume levels. You can listen to a song at 25% volume and it sounds just as great as at 75% volume.

Durability:
These earbuds were built with durability that you simply do not see in other earbuds. Shure thought of everything to make the most durable pair on the market. There is no risk of the cord exposing the wire, unless you drop them in your bike chain. The cord detaches from the bud and there is a plastic-like cover that ensures a tug on the cord will not ruin the earbud's sound by yanking the wires out of place. I feel safe wearing these while I exercise.

Comfort:
Once you figure out how to put these on correctly, they can be adjusted to fit any ear. The foam plugs are difficult to take off, but it is worth it to find the plug that fits your unique ear hole. The plastic thing that goes around your ear breaks in to wrap perfectly around the top side of the ear, securing an optimal fit, even when being active. Also, these are quite comfortable wearing at night, even if you're a side sleeper.

all in all, some great earphones!!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"old pair of Shures had cable fray in places that appear to be more robust in this newer version of these headphones. Small! can roll up and put in your pocket. Was doing a lot of air travel and needed something to cancel out the surrounding sounds which these do very well as long as you seat them in your ears properly! Didn't want big bulky over the ear headphones to carry around.

Next pair will likely be 315($199) or 425($299), possibly the Bose QuietComfort® 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling($299) however the Bose require the headphones to be charged for the noise cancellation to work"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently my Monster Turbines kicked the bucket so I was in the market for a new set of Ear buds for around $100. After researching for days I found that these made allot of lists for best headphones for about $100 so I decided give them a try. Initially I struggled getting them in my ear, the cable goes over the front of your ear and down behind it, and way they fit into your ear was a foreign to me at first. Maybe I was tired; maybe I had one too many beers, but had to Google some images to figure it out! Finally, I got them in my ears and cables situated, and I will say that they are perfectly comfortable. I wear them at work and they do a great job of noise isolation, so much so that I have to take them out when someone needs to speak with me. Compared to my old Turbines which had just your standard ear bud fit, these don’t easily pop out and back in, it takes 15-20 seconds to get them on and situated. I know that’s a small complaint, but when you have to do it often, it can be cumbersome. Finally my last complaint is the jack that plugs into your MP3 player is fat and doesn’t play well with cases. I have to take my I phone case off in order to plug it in. Now, on with the good; I was not sure if I liked them initially as they had much more bottom heavy sound, the Turbines were much brighter. After some time I realized the sound stage is just different and they grew on me. Listening to music, I heard elements I never knew existed in some of my favorite songs! They sound great! I would definitely recommend them if you’re in the market for a set of IEM’s and have a $100 budget.
Pros:
• Removable cable can be replaced with one that controls your I phone
• Great sounding for the price
• Noise Isolation
• Multiple Tips to customize fit
Cons:
• May be too Bass heavy for some
• Very different fit then a standard ear bud
• Plug to fat to work with most cases"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside for a shipping mishap on my original order, which Amazon took care of in a timely and professional manner, I am incredibly happy with these IEMs. They took a day or two to get used to on my ears due to the wire coming up and around over your ears, but the sound quality is unmatched, especially at this price. The ear buds come apart from the cable, which is very heavy and feels like it will last years. You can buy a replacement cable on the cheap if you need to, and not have to purchase a whole new pair of $100 headphones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have a pair of E2Cs. Unfortunately, I lost them. This is the newer version of that product.
I have been using a cheap pair of earbuds by another company, and haven't been happy with the sound quality. Luckily, these sound just like me E2Cs. Great low end for earbuds of this price, and a very nice and powerful sound across the full spectrum. You may not have the mids and super-fine details of a more expensive set, but you would be hard-pressed to find something better for this price.
The headphones are well-constructed, they come with a great selection of cushions, they have a solid and removable cord, and they fit perfectly in the ears.
If you are looking for a great mid-range pair of earbuds, these are a great choice. My music doesn't sound muddled and not ""full"" anymore!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own several pairs of expensive headphones, and these work two-fold and outshine the rest. I own the bose noise-cancalling headphones which are great but require batteries. These guys work not only as ear plugs for flying in helicopters or other loud aircraft, but also have great sound. I even wear them to block out my roommates snoring. The amazing part is that the sound quality say on a flight line is still super awesome even though super loud noises would hypothetically block it. The bass and treble are amazing. I would def. order these again if I lost them. Such a great product for a great price. And they are durable."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great but they don't fit that well, which reduces their noise suppressing feature. And they are incredibly hard to put on. If I'm wrong about that, I'd love to know... please comment and tell me what you do to decipher which way they go every time you put them on. There is so much swivel and reorientation going on, it's hard to figure out how to wear them. It takes a couple minutes to put them on each time.

Once on, they stay on pretty well, because of the over-the-ear wire option.

The other thing I'm dissatisfied about here is that Amazon misstates the MSRP as being higher than it is, and they thereby claim that these things have a bigger discount than they really do. The true discount is very small."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They have great sound but I can't wear them. I've tried all combinations of ear plugs and they just hurt my ears. But they sound great when they are in and sealed properly. Block out everything. I wish they were comfortable for me. Maybe they'll work for you. Not for me.

Revision: I got some different tips for them and they seem to fit well. The noise isolation is great but I've found I need to hear a little of my surroundings so I'll probably just use them when flying and in high noise environments like mowing the lawn and such. For my regular everyday listening I'm using the Bose ear buds that are in about the same price range. They work well, sound good (except for high noise environments) and let me hear what's going on outside."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased a pair of Shure SE 215 earphones after almost two weeks of research into products currently on the market for MP3 listening.Currently, I can say every time I use these 215s, I am totally impressed each time I put them on.My only prior experience with Shure products was in the 1960s,with microphones.They were all I could ask for also.The 215s are as described in several other reviews,they take some getting used to,but are worth the time spent finding the right set up for your ears.I would recommend this product to anyone!! UPDATE/I am still very happy with these earphones,since my original review,I realized that after reading more details I found that these ship with medium sized foam tips,this size may not work for everyone.It will well be worth your listening pleasure to order the package of replacement tips in all three sizes and pick the ones that best fit your ears.."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the second pair of SE215s I've purchased. While the first pair are alive and well, the second pair's right ear bud no longer works. I've had them for ~45 days and they have only seen light use in non-adverse conditions.

Pros: Sound isolation is outstanding. Fits snugly and will not fall out. Useable in a motorcycle helmet.

Cons: Stopped working 45 days into light use.

They would get 4 or 5 starts if the product kept working."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these have amazing sound. They actually have a decent seperation and good soundstage, I listen to a lot of classical, and it sounds about 3/4 as good as my Sony WH-MX10002 which are probably the best I've ever had. I also use a lighting cable from shure which signifcantly improves the sound, since it converts with the onboard dac to 24 bit/48khz from standard 16bit/44.1 khz sound. The installed medium foam and the medium flex fit best. I have average sized ear, so I didn't have any problems at all. I tend NOT to use in-ears, because actually do have a problem getting a seal with most earphones, but not these, the seal completely perfectly so I can get the full effect."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used these quite a bit, and the more I use them, the more I love these. For $100, the sound quality is out of this world. As a drummer, I have the volume cranked with all instruments mic'd up. The low end from the kick and bass guitar come through great with no clipping at all. Would highly recommend to anyone. The only drawback is that they take a little bit to break in the cable that wraps around your ears. But once they do break in, they stay in your ears perfectly. I have always had a hard time finding buds that will stay in my ears, but these work fantastic. Highly recommend."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine if you have no other ""good"" headphones. The frequency response is even and the removable cable is a nice idea. However, as with any connector there is the possibility of it shorting out and causing interruption in the signal. Along with other reviewers I had one earbud cutting out and found this an unacceptable situation. I had to return the set. The comfort and durability of the product is great otherwise. I just can't deal with intermittent connections on a headset in this price range."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"'Legendary Performance'. That's what it says on the box. Sounds like a typical product selling point. Sure, Shure, your products are legendary. I get it. You have a good marketing department. They'll probably be good. Maybe even marginally great.

So, with that in mind, here's what happened:
Unboxed headphones.
Sifted through needless papers warning be about death and destruction from using headphones (I didn't read into it that far. Might not have said this).
Slipped buds into ears
Turned on tunes.
*Mind blown*

So, for comparison, I normally listen to a pair of open-air Sennheiser HD570s. They are good. I mean, really, truly, amazingly good headsets. But they are open air, and I wanted something for the office. These Shures are mind-blowingly good indeed. The bass is strong, but not over the top. The midrange and trebles are astounding. Instantly, I can hear detail in some tracks that I've never heard before with my Sennheisers.

The sound is warm and open. The seal that the earbuds make is really amazing. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the foam that Shure uses on these headphones.

For the price, these headphones have no right being this good."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones! The best thing about them and the reason I got them is that they're super durable! I'm on my second pair now, but the first lasted through 4 years of daily use, only having to replace the cable once.
The sound quality is really great for the price. The range of sound is great, with a pretty even spread from deep bass to high treble. I'd definitely recommend also purchasing some of the Spinfit eartips/sleeves to go with them, as the ones that come with can get morphed after a lot of use, and others can improve the sound quality and isolation. The only con for these is that it took a while to get used to the fit around the ear, but now they're super comfortable."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as both In Ear Monitors while on stage, as well as normal headphones with my iPhone. The noise cancellation is fantastic, and the sound quality is very clear and crisp. Although it is a single driver, there is a nice blend of bass, midrange and treble. I have listened to everything from acoustic to metal, and can pick out everything in the mix. On stage they are great. I use them in conjunction with aviom in ear monitoring controls and they allow me to hear the entire band very well. For the price, they are a great product and I hope to one day be able to step up to dual or triple drivers. But for now, these work wonderfully within my musician's more meager budget."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third or fourth pair of Shure earphones. I really didn't like these at first. In fact, I almost sent them back. However, after using them for a few months, finding the best fitting tips, and most significantly, figuring out how to put them on quickly, I have to say they are by far the best sounding.

After 16 months of regular use, one of the channels developed a short. I'd get a crackling sound when the cable was wiggled. Shure provides a 2-year warranty. I went online, completed the form and mailed the earphones along with Amazon receipt back to Shure. In less than a week I received a brand-new set, not just a new cable. Kudos to Shure!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Significantly worse sound quality than my old SE210s, which are still working great after 5 years. I bought a pair of these for a friend and decided to get myself a set to make sure they were good. Sound is very muddy, the highs are not very clear, and the bass is exaggerated. I would compare these to iphone earbuds before comparing them to my old SE210s. I guess the build quality is better than my old headphones, but I bought these for sound...

The new cable is neat but these take ages to put in ear compared to my old SE210s with the ordinary plastic cable. It's a pain to get these seated then wiggle them around and possibly unseat them while trying to put the formed cable over your ear. It also has a terrible connector that will not pass through an iphone case."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have used Shure earbuds for a few years now and have loved each of the two pairs I have owned in the past. I received the SE 215-K model of earbuds on Saturday and have used them a few times now. The sound that these produce is as superb as my previous ones but I don't like how these fit. The hard plastic part that fits into the outer ear is not comfortable and the thick wire that wraps around my ears is too thick. These are just very uncomfortable. I can only stand to have them in my ears for about fifteen minutes at a time. This is bad considering that I wore my other ones all day with no discomfort at all. I wish I would have just bought a new pair of the older model.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good. I like the thick strong cables. It is a quality product. But I don't have as much noise isolation as I like with any of the different sizes of foam earplugs. It works well for bike riding and walking, but I am looking for something with better isolation for use on the motorcycle where the outside noise drowns out the music too much. I had some IR6i earplugs which worked good on the motorcycle, but they are no longer available and I lost the pair I had."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, they're absolutely perfect for working musicians that need affordable in-ear monitors for performing. They're also perfect for working in noisy environs (like power plants or constrction) where you need hearing protection, but want music while you work.

The sound quality is amazing. Rich bass, sweet mids, and tight highs, everything is reproduced perfectly. These are near reference quality, which is better than you'll need in any of the aforementioned situations.

Buy these!! DON'T BE STUPID."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds have very good sound isolation when playing music, and work pretty well when not playing anything at all. The bass is pretty impressive for earbuds, and everything else is balanced well. The braided wire is very tough and it takes a while to get used to in the beginning. I am 5'7'' and the the wire is a little too long. I always find my wire getting caught on my bike if I don't have it tucked in. The only real gripe I have is that it doesn't have inline controls. It's very annoying to always take my phone out to pause music or adjust the volume. For $100 dollars, I would have expected controls to be included."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my second pair of Shure earbuds. My first were the SE115 and I loved them. They fit snug like earplugs and had great bass. When they finally died after 2 years I was planning to buy them again, but came across the se215s. since 100 bucks is the sweet spot for earbuds for me, I got these since there was not a price huge difference to upgrade.

Pros
The earbuds can detached at the ear, so if you mess up the cord all is not lost.
Great sound
Price is right

Cons
This is just a personal preference, but on the se115 the cord detached where the earbud cords came together. You could buy an accessory cord for phone/ipod controls. I liked this because I could detached the cord without taking off my earbuds and put the cord under my shirt, and it would disconnect there instead of ripping out of my ears or damaging my ipod if it got snagged.

Also, these are meant to wrap around the backside of your ears. There is a wire that bends around."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing, I purchased this product approximately 7 months ago for a bargain price of $97.00 (cheap). This morning while on my run, I lost sound on the left side. this is indicative of cheap Chinese made product. As the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for!"" I think if a U.S. company could make something like this I would by another pair. In conclusion, be advised that if you purchase this product, don't expect it to last more than 6-7 months or suffer the disappointing consequence. It does have a comfortable fit and sounds great for a disposable earbud."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IEMs are excellent! The only higher end thing I can compare them to are the bose earbuds. They aren't quite as ""Basey"" as the bose are, but they have an excellent sound profile. The sound isolation is ridiculous.. I can't tell you the amount of times I've received looks from friends and the wife for not hearing the door, hearing the phone ring, the dog barking, or shouts from the next room over. Woops!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several pairs of earbud headphones over the years, from sony, sennheiser, and shure. These are the best by far.
We all know that Shure sound quality is amazing, especially at this price point, but my biggest complaint with earbud headphones is that after a year (of heavy use) the cord connection to the bud ALWAYS wears down, sometimes breaks. I want to reiterate that this has happened without fail for me, on schedule.

So when I went looking for a new pair this cord replacement system sounded ideal, and so far it hasn't even broken at all - because the replacement port is in the area that it usually breaks in!

My only, minor, complaint is that the ear wrap around is so durable that it's not conforming to my ears and feels a bit awkward looping over them, sometimes pulling the buds out of my ear as I move around. This may be alleviated by my finding better fitting foam pads.

Sound quality is great, balanced, and I hear instruments I've never heard before from lesser quality buds. The music tracks I listen to are usually 320kbs, but I have some higher quality which I would need to test on a player that supports them I.E not an iphone."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great with my now 2 year old se846 ear buds. Just had to snap the cables on and pair it with my phone/pad. Pairing pairing was a breeze: turn off, press center button till the phones say 'bluetooth pairing', then click on the phone's blue tooth connect button. Finding the power connector was far more difficult. It is located on the side of the button box beneath a really small black cover, and I needed a magnifying glass to find it. Once found, using the connector was easy. The sound is fine, and I haven't noticed a drop in quality compared to the OPPO HA-2SEPortable Headphone Amplifier & DAC i have been using for the last couple of years. The sound is outstanding with either amp, but I love the wireless connection to my devices. Count me a fan of this RMCE-BT1."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an EXCELLENT product. It works just as intended and it doesn't even get in the way of anything because the cord is somewhat short, so its perfect for me. I like to use my bluetooth at home while I'm working on things. Because I can get distracted while holding a phone, its easier for me to have the headphones on.

The sound for media is excellent. The sound for voices is a bit off but...all blue tooth seems to be off slightly. There is one thing though...
If you pair the headphones with multiple electronics, it may connect to both items. I paired it to my phone and computer. Well, I leave my bluetooth on for both. When I turned on everything, my headphones tried to connect to both computer and phone, and it did.
What ended up happening was that it showed on the phone and computer was that the headphones were connected, but it didn't work for either one. Just make sure you pair to one thing at a time or it may try to connect, and you'll think something is broken when its not."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit (original review below): I received the replacement pair and as hoped/expected everything is right again in the world... They sound great! I'm short of 5-stars because I haven't quite figured out how to easily put them in my ears... Once in, they sound great. Decent job of sound isolation, not quite as good at this aspect as my old Etymotics, but loads better than other ear""buds"". The sound is solid and so far, I'm very pleased with these IEM's; bonus is the price point that this quality comes in at. If you've got the green to step up to this price point, it's worth the investment.

Thanks Amazon for the easy exchange process and making this right as soon and as easy it was.

Original Review:
Very unhappy upon initial listen... The packaging was great, and everything was unopened and hadn't been tampered with. However the left channel didn't work. There seems to be a ""sweet spot"" about 4"" up from the jack end that has to be ""wiggled"" or crimped just right to get anything to play in the left ear. It would cut in/out when messed with in that spot.

Thank you Amazon for having an easy return/exchange process; I'm going to take advantage of the exchange since this was the first round. I'm hopeful that this is an outlier and an anomoly that won't happen again.

I'll return with an update and new star rating once the exchange comes in. I've also sent Shure an email, and will comment appropriately (good/bad) with how they handle the feedback as well. Again, I hope and expect that this was just not my lucky day, and definitely not indicative of their standards and quality... We'll see."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Super disappointed. Zero instruction on where to FIND the charging port. It’s tiny- and on the controls. Also terribly hard to find were the L and R wire indicators so I could snap my Shure earbuds on to the Bluetooth accessorie cable. The lettering is so small you can’t read it without a magnifying glass, and the instructions nor Shure web site offer any assistance. I was thrilled with the sound, the dynamic and the volume when I was using the earbuds with the hard wire, but must admit I am terribly let down by the Bluetooth accessory. They were difficult to pair, the sound cuts in and out, and the volume and fidelity is extremely week. In short, 180 degrees different than the wired version. I guess the upside is that the Bluetooth cord won’t get caught in the wheel of my motorcycle if it comes unplugged, so I will try it out, but these will likely be returned so I can order the cord for my SE215 earbuds. Can’t say enough good about the earbuds, but the Bluetooth is not up to par."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to only rap and hiphop and I was surprised on how much bass these actually had. Upgraded from a very bassy set of ath-im70 earbuds. Those have a lot of bass but the highs are really capped. Using the foam tips for a good seal. These open up the soundstage a lot more. Driven them with a cell phone dac and a audioengine dac with a deep v eq and full bass from Poweramp on an Android phone. Of course the audioengine dac pushes them harder but these can handle it well. One of my favorite songs to play on them is ""poppin' them thangs"" - g-unit - heavy bass song with a light Melody that you can differentiate between the highs."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First the good:

For in-ear monitors that costless than $100, the sound quality is surprisingly rich, deep, and accurate. I won't go into detail on the sound, as others have covered it quite thoroughly. Certainly not the ""best"" money can buy, but certainly among the best $100 can buy.

They are also durable. I've been using a pair under horrible conditions for almost two years (outdoors, In heat and humidity, exposed to plenty of sweat).They still work and sound great...well, they did after I replaced the cables. While the cables are more durable than any other earbud cables I've used, they did finally fail. The great news is: I then bought a pair of new, replacement cables, plugged them in, and am continuing to use the same, original pair of SE215s.

The best thing about them, and other sound-isolating in-ear devices? When you reduce the ambient sound level, you don't have to turn the volume as high to listen. Result? Better sound with less ambient noise interference, AND reduced potential for hearing damage.

The bad? The connectors between the monitors and the cables can collect dirt requiring disassembly and cleaning. It doesn't happen often, just once or twice per year with heavy use.

The most difficult thing about the SE215 is fitting them, and they MUST be fitted properly or they'll sound thin and tinny. The wire loop must be bent carefully to ensure proper alignment with the ear canal, and the correct size foam inserts must be used. The smallest foam insert barely works in my ear canals and doesn't work at all in my wife's: she can't wear the SE215 because of fit.

This brings up a final point about fit: everybody's ears are different. Once you have the loops properly fitted to your ears, they probably won't fit anyone else's. We tried. We swapped out the foam inserts, but the loops wouldn't allow proper alignment with my wife's ears. Once the loops were bent to fit, the inserts didn't work. Then the loops had to be bent back--and they'll only tolerate so many bends before they break.

In summary, once fitted, these in-ear monitors are excellent for the money: they sound great and they're durable. Proper fitting can be an issue, but once properly fitted, they'll likely only work for one person. The only practical way to share would be having two sets of wires, bent to fit, with two properly sized foam inserts. Worth the money? An enthusiastic 'yes'."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are two common focuses of earbuds that I often get asked. ""Are those earbuds loud?"" and ""Are those earbuds high quality with their sound?""
Now, there is so much more that goes into a pair of earbuds than their loudness and sound quality, (durability, comfort, etc.) but those are the two most common. These earbuds will satisfy both questions. Yes, they're loud. Yes, they have amazing sound quality. However there is another pair of earbuds on the market. I can't imagine that if you're in this market range for earbuds and have not heard of them, but they are the 1More triple drivers.
Me personally, I would go with the 1More Triple Drivers any day. They have more bass and also have a better soundstage. Not to mention an in-line microphone. The 1More Triple Drivers are less loud, although, most people will find their volume to be just fine. Also, they are less durable in comparison to the Shure SE215s. Although, it's hard to compete with a KEVLAR-REINFORCED cable. That's not to say that the 1More Triple Drivers aren't high-quality as far as build goes. They just aren't AS good.
Now, I can't diss on either decision. They are both great earbuds. All that I'm saying is, if I had the choice, I would rather go with the 1More Triple Drivers. However, as I said, neither decision is a bad one."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my old wired SE215 after 4.5 years (which were themselves a replacement for the E2C model that I had for over 6 years) and replaced them with this SE215 BT, so I already know about the great sound and was used to the ergonomics of these sound isolating earphones. These are, of course, the same earphones as my old set, just with BT instead of wired (though as others have noted, they are interchangeable, you can unplug them from the BT cable and hook them into the regular wired cable)

The BT is pretty easy to use. I've not used other BT earphones so I can't compare but I have used other BT devices. One of the other reviewers wished the controls were lower on the cable and I understand the complaint but find it a minor issue myself. I'm happy to have the short cable and don't find it difficult at all to manipulate.

Haven't used them long enough to comment on the battery life, will report back"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My ears are really ""picky"" (no pun intended) when it comes to accepting earbuds -- I really think that I am in the very small minority of people in which most earbud headphones do not fit my ears. This is further complicated by the fact that I've been searching for headphones that stay in while I am weight training as well as running at the park.

Luckily I stumbled upon these Shure SE215's while surfing on Amazon. I was worried that spending this much on headphones (more than the $20-30 I was initially only ready to spend) would not live up to the $100 price tag. I am far from an audiophile, but boy have I been happy with these Shure's. After my Sennheiser Momentum over-the-ear's, these are my favorite headphones when on-the-go. The sound is very clear, with very clear lyrics, mid's and high's. The bass is very good, too; while sometimes I feel it could use a little bit more 'boom', it is nevertheless deep and does not drown out vocals or instruments.

One important thing I have come to learn about what makes headphones sound 'good' is ... the FIT is extremely important. This is doubly important when it comes to the Shure SE215's. For one, the in-ear monitors (IEM's) fit extremely well in [my] ears. And thanks to the bendable around-the-ear wire hooks, the IEM's are not going to pop out of your ears during exercise -- this is something that has always been a problem for my ears with earbuds. The second thing is, it is imperative that earbuds of any kind create a nearly air-tight SEAL inside your ear canal -- this is extremely important in delivering the bass to your ears and not let it leak out. Fortunately these Shure's come with 3 sets of foam tips, as well as silicone sleeves. I had purchased a pair of Comply foam tips for these headphones, but found that these, nor the stock Shure foam tips, locked in the bass well enough for me. But to my surprise, the stock silicone sleeves provided the best seal and sound! Not what I was expecting, I was thrilled that I found one setup that worked just right for me.

My first Shure's, a really good experience -- provided everything holds up over time, I can see myself going with this brand again when it's time to upgrade ..."

They need to be re-synced with your phone about twice a week, are highly subject to interference while walking around, and they frequently lose connection while using so they are not reliable for a call. They definitely used cheap components on these and it shows. Total waste of money."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for a long distance motorcycle ride and researched what was considered the best sound isolating earphones for riding. The Shure SE215's sounded great in my living room but only sounded ok on the road. In fact one of my buddies I was riding with bought a set of ""truck stop specials"" for 1/4th the price of these and they not only sounded the same (if not better), but were far more comfortable and isolated sound WAAAAAAYYYY better than mine. The final reason for the low review is I found the headphones to be awkward to put in the ear and remain there. I tried the different size ear pillows it came with but nothing really worked out too well. Save your money and just grab some cheap throw aways."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The primary reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their noise-isolation. I must agree- these are by far the most noise-isolating earbuds I have ever worn. Noise levels of these are significantly less than my noise-canceling ear buds!

The second reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their comfort. They have a small profile that fits within the external ear, meaning that I can lie down with my head against a pillow and experience no discomfort. I am not aware of any other earbuds on the market that share this characteristic.

I was delightfully surprised by the excellent build-quality of these earbuds. Although these are in mid-tier price range (currently $99), they have the build quality of higher-tier earbuds that normally go for $200-$300.

I highly recommend these. They are great for studying and falling asleep in a noisy environment."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just ordered a set of these to replace my old, reliable Shure E3c earphones. Both are over-the-ear earphones. I found the SE215's boomy and lacking in mids and highs, music that sounded live and crisp in my old E3c's sound dead and muffled in the SE215's. I'm returning these and trying the SE315's, instead. The only positive about the new 215s was that (for my ears) the fit of the small black foamies was much, much better than the yellow foamies in the E3c's. Incredible isolation, almost TOO good, if you know what I mean. I could hear my own heartbeat and every step I took translated to a vibration in my ears. Also, the formable wires at the ends of the cords provides an improved fit around the top of my ears than the old E3c's. The 315's seem to share the same physical design, so I hope that the sound quality is better. Oh well, what did I expect? The 215's were half the price of the old E3c's, ten years ago!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love it. I hook my 425s to it every so often at work or on the road and I have no complaints so far. It's stayed connected to my Nexus 6p and my iPad 2nd Generation (yes the old one). I haven't tried it with an iPhone but I assume it would work just as well. It is well worth $100 to get myself a very nice set of wireless headphones.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say, I bought this for mainly color and Bluetooth capability that came as side dish. It’s a little too expensive for a side dish thou..
However, the main SE215 earbuds are probably one of the best out there for the price. And the fact that I can just swap lines around makes this pretty worth it (I did purchase wire as well). Can’t think of how many earbuds have been trahsed because of the line.

Edit: I thought there was lack of function due to not having user guide, but I searched it up and it was just different command. Three -> four stars"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these earphones to replace another set of Shures whose cables spontaneously shed the insulation, leaving 2 very thin wires exposed to each earphone. The new earphones have cables that are much thicker, and probably won't flake off like the first ones did. However, the insulation is so stiff that it's hard to position the earphone in your ear. Also any movement of your head can cause the earphones to shift in the ear canal, intermittently blocking the sound in that ear. Otherwise, the sound is good if you can keep the earphones in place."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a big fan of shure's E2C headphones. Yes, I too was bit by the ""one side cutout"" issue but their sound was beautiful with great noise reduction. I bought the SE215s as their replacement and must say they are very nice. Sound is great, rich, clear, and balanced. The cord seems sturdy and the ability to replace it is a nice feature (I bought a replacemnt cord just in case). My only minor issue is the fit - my left ear canal must be slightly larger than my right and the ""seal"" is not as good on that ear. It does not impact my enjoyment but I find myself adjusting the left side (pushing it back in ear) a little more often than I did with E2Cs. Again, this is minor and I would recommend these. Good sound, good noise isolation."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not pretend to be an audiophile, but I have nothing but praise for their sound. I will let OC reviewers quibble over nuances of sound quality. I got these earphones mainly because of their reputation for good sound isolation. For me they excel at that. None of the included ear canal tips fit my ears properly, so I got some ribbed silicone ones from Sweetwater that did the trick. The tiny dots denoting the and left right earpieces are silly, so I painted on a larger ones. Once I got the knack of putting the earphones in place I became pleased with their sound. I have experienced no listening fatigue so I gather that they produce little distortion, another key feature for me. I am mildly annoyed with the geeky look of the clear model. I guess I expected that the wires would break and I wanted to be able to see them do it. But these wires are not going to break, ever. I should have gotten the black ones instead. Just really great earphones. Why pay more?"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great sound, but getting them in your ear is a 30 second process of twisting and angling, and then they're not the most comfortable things on the planet. Also, they were lacking the out-of-the-box bass of Sennheiser CX300 II's that I'd bought time and again prior, so had to dial it up in my mp3 player's equalizer. As someone who's gone through no less than 7 pairs of CX300's mostly due to poor cable durability, the robust build is a welcome change and the reason I switched - will update review should anything change."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's very convenient to upgrade a pair of SE315's I've had for years to Bluetooth. It is buddy and not ideal though. I am using these with an iPhone 8+, and iPad Pro 10.5"" running iOS 11.0.2.

- Function button will pause/play songs but double and triple press does not change track like the wired cables do
- There is no downloadable user guide and I lost packaging so I can't confirm the above is not a different sequence than the other cables
- Battery life is low than I'd like--I would have gladly traded some extra weight/size of the enclosure to get 50-100% longer battery life for long flights
- No USB-C...
- Sometimes when trying to resume playing music on my phone, it will cause Music (the native iOS app) to immediately pause, it just keeps pausing whether I try to resume play with the app or the remote. I have to turn off, and repair to resolve the issue
- Cable clip that you can use to connect the two sides is nice but it's fiddly and seems it will quickly wear out or rip. A magnetic connector would be a great improvement

It'd be nice if there were an accompanying app to setup which devices it remembers and make it easy to switch between. Similar to Bose. As it is, I have to turn off, put into pairing mode, and repair to switch between my iPad and iPhone. On other headphones it is a much simpler process.

Not a bad first offering from Shure, but it has a lot of room for improvement. These are good enough for workouts and casual listening but I hope Shure recognizes they need to be dumping a lot of money and resources into iterating their Bluetooth offerings to stay relevant."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE215 are great for every day listeners but to say it is great for its price can be far fetched. Music you listen to may be a factor in appreciating these earphones, as many acoustic and classical music may sound muddled and confusing. The sound stage isn't there, but you get more of a direct sound like you would hear from a laptop, but instead tunneled directly in your ears. For comfort and build, I would have to give it a star as it is pretty comfortable if you get a hang of the ear loop design. Overall just a basic earphone."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE on Bluetooth: The dropouts are starting to get a bit ridiculous. Easily two to four a minute. What in the world... EXTREMELY Annoying...

Good stuff for the price. Especially considering if you bought the SE215 with the 3.5mm jack separately, and then bought the Bluetooth cable, it'll cost $50 more. The SE215's themselves are a great entry level IEM for those who aren't too pedantic about their music. It's dynamic drivers aren't as accurate as their balanced armature counterparts, but that's what makes these IEMs great - they're fun.

The Bluetooth on the other hand, it's better than most solutions on the market right now, but still needs work. There is an audible noise floor, albeit being very very low (IMO), and Bluetooth connection is still not perfect, there's this occasional cut-out of playback for about half a second every now and then. Haven't had a chance to test battery life just yet.

Build quality? Not amazing, but definitely solid."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215k is a shallow fit, over-the-ear earphone. The package contents include: the earphones themselves, a set of S,M,L silicone tips, 1 set of memory foam tips, a cleaning tool for the ear tips, and a soft shell carry case. The earphones are made of a rigid plastic and the cables are thick and of high quality. These are very comfortable, but you will have to adjust to how big these are if you haven't owned something like this before. A nice little feature about these earphones is that the cables are removable and replaceable. You can either get the original cables from Amazon or Shure, but the cables from the Logitech UE series earphones just as well and a bit cheaper too.

On to the sound. This earphones has a lot of bass that extends down fairly deep and can sound a bit muddy on some tracks. With genres such as hip hop, dubstep, EDM, etc, these do a great job and will fulfill the needs of your average bass head. The mids are warm and very clear and the highs are a bit rolled off, maybe a little rolled off. Due to the rolled off highs, these are not fatiguing and can be used for several hours before having to take a break. Keep in mind that these isolate very well, so if you're walking down the street or anything, make sure you are well aware of your surroundings.

The Shure SE215K is not without flaws however, there a few things that are bothersome right out of the box. The first is the fit of these earphones. While it isn't a big issue, new users might have problems properly inserting these into your ears. The core of the problem is the memory cord that wraps around your ear. You will need to bend constantly to conform to the curves of your ear but after a while it will retain its shape.

These earphones perform extremely well and for the price, it includes many accessories. Shure even offers a 2 year warranty with the SE215K which adds even more value to the package. If you're a fan of good bass, warm mids, and slightly recessed highs, these earphones are a no brainer."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds I've ever owned. I just got a set of Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones with their best noise cancellation. Because these earbuds tips are foam they actually isolate better than the Bose headphones. Phenomenal. And because outside noise doesn't leak in the bass is insane. They also respond super well to EQ adjustments. Super clean sound. They aren't conventially shaped but for good reason. They are insanely comfortable. You can lay on you ear and they don't dig into your ear. No complaints about them. Love them.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these 1 1/2 years now, mostly for jogging or gym work. They are great! Better bass than other earbuds I have tried. Takes awhile to get used to putting them in your ears, but the seal is tight and you block out a lot of external noise. So, these are also good on airline flights. My set once went into the washing machine for 15 minutes, in a shorts pocket, before I noticed. I let them dry out for 2 days, and they worked fine. About the only drawback is that they are like fishhooks, constantly snagging on everything. If I bundle them into a hand-full, it takes a minute to untangle them at the gym. Small price to pay for such good quality."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have 2 pairs. 1 pair is 2 years old. Great fit for a woman's ears with the set of adapters. I wear the older pair wear for workouts. I notice on a couple of songs delivered via iPod, there can be some audible fuzz in the treble. I downloaded Apple lossless to see if the file is the cause or the earphones. Still fuzzy in right module. Soon after that I lost most of the sound in the right module. Before sending in, I looked over the maintenance to see if the cause was me. It was. When wearing during workouts, the sweat and ear wax will attach to the inside grill of the removable ear bud and block or distort sound. I removed them, cleaned with soap and water, dried them, reattached and the sound is back to out of the box quality. Just cleaning the outside of the buds is not sufficient."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The 3 stars I gave has nothing to do with sound quality. I love the balance, clarity, and sound isolation that these headphones provide...when they work.

I gave 3 stars because quite often the connection between the left ear driver connection and the cable connection seem to lose contact and sound will cut in and out depending on how the cord moves. I searched around and noticed several people who have had the exact same issue on forums.

I would recommend doing a bit of research before you commit to buying these headphones.
Bottom line though is that sound quality is absolutely amazing...again when it's working properly."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a drummer who needs in-ear monitoring for live and studio situations. I'd been using Vic Firth Isolation Headphones which I think are good, BUT I've always wanted something smaller and lightweight for using live and not look like Princess Leia. I was in doubt at first beacuse I thought ""how much sound isolation will I get with just in-ear earphones?"".. and the result was amazing!.. I'm pretty sure this Shure in-ear headphones isolate more external sound than my Vic Firth Headphones (which might be bad for some)... but for me it was perfect. I wouldn't comment on sound quality, which I think is good, but I've never tried those more expensive earphone models with more sound drivers and stuff. Oh, and I think the price is decent for what you get."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is muffled at higher volumes, the bass is not distinct, the treble is not crisp, it has the best build quality, ergonomically designed earphones I have ever bought but for the price I was NOT too blown away by the sound."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been searching for years for comfortable great fitting small headphones that didn't compromise sound for size! These little buds have it all! Someone recommended the Bose and I found those too tinny, little bass and I'm not someone who likes a lot of bass. A twenty dollar pair of Sony's came with high recommendations and couldn't try those so I took the plunge. Would have done just as well to tear up a twenty dollar bill and flush in the crapper! They were the worse ever with maximum distortion and no bass at all! Shure has just enough of everything, well balanced, crisp and clear sound! I am most pleased and would highly recommend these to anyone!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Earphones ever. I went through a lot of expensive headphones. Usually they give up on me within 3 month to 1 year . I had 2 pairs of more expensive Shure, Beats, Klipsch and god knows what else. I am sure audio maniacs might say something negative about sound range or quality but if I can barely hear up to 15- 16k HZ why would i spend money for earphones with 22k. Bass is good, sound is clear, cables are replaceable and durable, noise isolation better then in my $350 over the ear headphones. What is not to like here? It is a keeper."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though the sound quality is great but the built quality leaves much to be desired. Only after a few weeks of usage I started to hear distortion and cracking in the sound and even though I use it like my previous ear piece Klipsh Image S4 which lasted a few years before I spoil it when I fell down while ice skating during which the cable got pulled and cause an internal cable breakage.

After the distortion and cracking became intolerable I purchased a replacement cable. It work great for a few months then the distortion and cracking creeps in again for the past few days. I will not be buying any Shure ear piece again. Due to limited funds I might have to get another replacement cable before I switch to perhaps Westone."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok this review is based on out the box with no burn in time. I used a Cowon J3 with mp3s @ 320kbps and FLAC . Types were jazz, rock, r&b , old school hip hop, reggae, and blues. Have other types of music but this is all I tested.

This is the best overall sounding IEM I have ever heard. My other IEMs have been MEElectronics a151 , MEElectronics sp51, Denon AH-C710k , Denon AH-C452K , Phillips SHE-8500 , and Altec Lansing UHP336. They take a little getting used to getting into the ear the first time. After that it gets easier.

Bass: Clean for the most part. Only get a little muddy on song where the studio tried to pump up the bass more than it should have.

Mids: clean and warm

Highs: it's there but doesn't hurt your ears.

These are also fun sounding. Not sure if that is a real thing but that's how I will describe them. I have not tried to take the cable off as I think only reason to do that is when it needs to be replaced."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these every day at work. They work great for airplanes, or the subway, they block out most of the outside noise. I do Not recommend for running etc. They are not water proof, and the connectors by the headphone start to do weird things.

So great for the office, airplane, subway. Not good where lots of sweat / moisture are going to be poured all over them.

They take a bit to get used to and are kind of weird to get in the first few times, once you get the hang of it and find the correct ear attachment they are amazing. Music is now disappointing when I am not listening to it on these."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these things, one of the best products i have ever purchased on amazon. I was going to buy the model they sell for 800$, but i decided to buy these, the sound quality is very amazing. i use to have a 300$ headset but it i now use these to game and listen to music on. if you are looking for a extention go to https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBC9OU8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds themselves seem to be of good quality and produce sound in line with the price point. However, the cables REEK of cheap imported vinyl. Additionally, the cables are stiff and transmit sound when physically disturbed. At least the connectors are industry standard. To get rid of the nasty smell, I invested in a set of good quality cables and all is well except that my wallet is now $50 lighter than it should be."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SE215 has a very non-fatigue and relaxed mid and highs and a very fun bass due to bumped-up lows. Great macro-dynamics and coherent sound due to contact with your ears. Because recessed highs and bumped-up bass, they are less analytical than some of the higher end IEM but they are my go-to earbuds for walking and air travels.

Have had them for a year and recently compared those to Etymotic ER4 XR. Compared to SE215, ER4 XR's has a more analytical sound due to a bump in 2K Hz and can be fatiguing for those who don't like too much high frequencies. ER4 XR's bass is more recessed than SE215. I returned ER4."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried a lot of different in ear headphones (Bose, Beats, Ear Candy) and these not only have the best sound, but are truly noise cancelling. I've used both the foam inserts (like old school ear plugs) and the thin rubber versions - they both fit well and are comfortable. The BEST part of these headphones are that the components pop apart for replacing. I'm super hard on headphones and after having them for awhile (and constantly getting them tangled, yanked on, and kinked up) the sound started getting ""crackly."" I replaced a pop apart section of the cord and voila! they're just as good as they were when I first bought them. The Bose in-ear headphones I had before these were not only more expensive but went right into the garbage just a few months after having them. I will keep (and LOVE) this Shure pair as long as they continue to make replacement parts."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! But please note these are over-the-ear monitors, and don't seem to be designed for use like regular earbuds. If you do a lot of online video messaging and don't like earphone cables dangling as you speak, then these might be worth trying. I use them to monitor audio while video recording and keep them behind me. It's great in that application.

A couple of subtle but solid points: the case is a not soft case, and that makes a difference. Thank you Shure for giving me something protective to hold these when not in use. Plus, the multiple size and shapes of the sleeves is really a nice touch."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, my puppy (back then) chewed them up as well as the replacement pair I begrudgingly bought after those. Needless to say after $300 and no headphones to show for it, I was reticent about purchasing a new pair.

As with the old pairs, these new SE215s can only be heard to be appreciated. They no longer come with the christmas tree fitting that looked more like a torture device. But that's beside the point. The fittings you're interested in are the expanding earplug styles in small, medium, & large. There's a band I'm an avid fan of and I've been listening to all of their albums for roughly 15 years now. Before I owned Shure headphones, I thought I knew every melody and note in every song of theirs. What I failed to realize was that with headphones which allowed true noise cancellation (not BS electronic white-noise) I was able to listen to far lower volumes. Confused? I was too. At such low volumes, you can hear what would have otherwise been drowned out by the louder elements of the same song. The added bonus was riding the subway on the C line to work from Brooklyn to Manhattan and the normal cacophony of f-bombs and arguments became a silent movie to whichever track I chose that morning. Bonus points for faster tempo music during fist fights!

There are two honest drawbacks despite my fanboy appreciation of these headphones audio quality.

1. When someone needs to talk to you for example while working at your desk, they're a pain in the ass to keep scrunching and putting back into your ear. Doubly so with this new over the ear design (which also takes a little practice).

2. The realization that you don't clean your ears as well as you think you do. Don't believe me? There's a reason they come with an ear-wax removal tool. Gross."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very nice and durable .. I often fall asleep with them,, they sound great and if I break the cord I can order a new cord .
I have lots of different earbuds including Bose ... I have to be very careful with the Bose since the cable breaks and your earbuds are history
I did add Comply brand earbud covers but the ones that come with them are pretty good as well."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I have tried DOZENS of bluetooth headphones/sets/buds and I decided to keep these. Sound is great!
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a great purchase for use as in ear monitors and daily headphones! The sound quality is amazingly crisp and clear and the bass is solid. It really depends on what music you listen to though (I prefer rock and the thumping lows of the kick drum sounds great along with bass guitar when turned up a bit, but it's not too bass heavy, very evenly distributed highs, mids, and lows). I really enjoy the feature of the removable cord so you don't have to waste money on another pair if the cord frays or something. As for fitment, I like the extra earbuds included so you can get the feel you want. Also, the stiff but bendable end near the earbud sometimes loses it shape but it's nothing too big, I'm just being a bit critical. Sometimes it just needs to be messed with a bit to fit right. The fact that the cord is wrapped in Kevlar just adds to the durablity of the product, which I find is a nice touch. I'm not sure why anybody would spend $100 more to buy the SE425 when the SE215 has the whole package at a much better price. Overall 10/10 would buy again

One last note- while using these as daily headphones people thought they were hearing aids (I got the clear version). The black version is a good choice too but I find that the clear is better if you want it to look discrete and semi invisible."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones, VERY comfortable, to the point where you forget that they are in, and they block almost all of the outside noise when something is playing. Sound is clear and crisp, i am not an audiophile, but they do sound great. Mine came with everything except the cleaning tool, that being the only downside these are amazing earphones for the price! Fitting them is not that hard, just watch the how to video. Highly recommend!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a great sound and prevent outside noise from entering. They fit into my ear perfectly. Unfortunately, the right side had a bad connection and was always going in and out. This happened after only a few uses. I returned them for a refund and won't be buying another set."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's hard to tell the difference between the wired and bluetooth connection. That's a big advance for Shure and for anyone who uses their earphones.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds started out strong, but within a few months of purchase left bud sound started cutting out at certain angles and the foam pieces became so loose they were constantly falling off and getting lost. The only positive aspect of this product is the strong cord, but that's not worth the price."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and the tips are nice, I ordered some comfort tips for better fit. The fitment around the ears is great, stays in place when running, lifting weights, situps/laying down and doing jump rope. There seems to be no noise/rub on the wire and it is nice and thick. Not an issue so far and I've had it for quite some time now. I use it at the gym constantly. The 3.5mm tip is a bit on the clunky side if you have a nice thin MP3 player/phone you are using but not causing any issue just thought I'd mention it"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a singing drummer in a rock band, I elected to go with in-ear monitoring instead of using floor wedges. I didn't need to go wireless, so I paired the SE215's with a Rolls Personal Amp system and am up & running for under $200! These in-ear monitors sound awesome, and have a surprising amount of Bass level especially since they are single drivers. Plenty of Bass, to the point where I had to turn the Bass Guitar way down in the overall mix. And the sound isolation is good as well. I recommend trialing the different sizes of the included foam earpieces to customize a size most suitable for you. I went with the largest ones which isolate better than the small sizes for me. Perhaps best of all, my ears don't scream after practice or shows anymore as I only hear at what volume Ievel I so choose. This product has truly helped make me a better player/singer as I can finally HEAR the Mix and my own voice! Highly recommend this product."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most have left positive reviews that I am in agreement with. Amazing when combined with an iPod and a headphone amp. Takes you to another world. Total isolation is required and I will say that Shure should make it easier for those with larger ear openings. I did order extra large yellow foam sleeves and helps but still have to work to get a great seal. Shure, please add extra large foam sleeves or something to help make a quicker and better seal? Once sealed you are in heaven.

One funny thing I did notice is that with these isolated ear buds it is so clear a sound and so isolated that all you could do was listen, and not sing along like with on ears, etc. Baby's will not bother you on airplanes!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely take some getting used to when putting on. It can apply pressure to your ear (slightly annoying) if you don’t put them in correctly. Try the different sizes, it does make a difference. Sound so far is good, didn’t blow me away, but it’s still early. Note that the plug isn’t a straight shot like Apple earbuds. It’s at a 90 degree and if your case is bulky, it may not reach. I had to shave down the casing to get it. Will update as necessary."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you want an objective review of the sound quality and build quality of this earphones, you can either youbue it or google it.. I am pretty sure they are the single best earphone at this price range that can actually rival the much more expensive ones. Thus i won't delve into the technical side of this earphone because there is already plenty of sites out there that do this better than i can.

well, I am more shock of is the unparalleled build quality of this baby.

this thing just look classy and everything is fantastic. The earbuds are made of memory foam, the shapes bend to best fit your ear canal. One of the side benefits the foamed earbud is the superb noise isolation; i can't even hear the typing from my mechanical keyboard while listening to music on medium volume.

Even though the wire is replaceable, it is double layered to increase durability. Mine is the silver version so the wired is sheathed in a thin transparent white plastic, looks awesome.

the earphone fits so well and comfortable inside your ear you won't even notice it after a minute or 2. I run with it almost everyday and it never falls.

All in all, i am extremely impressed by how well this product is and at 99 dollars it just dwarfs the competition. It does take a while to get used to putting it on on a regular basis and it does look weird for some people.

UPDATE:
Sound quality is fine as usual
but sadly there is already distortion of sound causing by the connector.. oh man, as a vivid earphone user the very sign of this gives me a big headache especially for a pair of earphones that has only been used for less than 2 weeks and is being extremely well taken care of .

i am sending it back for a replacement, hopefully the next one will be problem free..

i dont want to downgrade my review until i extensively test the new one.. hopefully mine was only a lemon because i really like this product"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using these as in-ear monitors with the band I play in, and they do great. The foam earpieces do a great job of blocking out sound around me, which protects my hearing as much as anything else. The sound produced by the SE215 isn't audiophile quality, but there's plenty of volume available and it has a pleasant, full range."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pricey but sonically a step up from cheap buds. The foam molds this includes are far superior to anything else other than perhaps custom molds. But I still don’t think it’s worth the price. I think this is more in the range of a 50-70$ product. The Bass response isn’t particularly inspiring and if that’s what you need, this isn’t for you."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Isolating is superior to Noise canceling. Noise canceling has to guess the phase and frequency of the sound to try to knock it down. When it guesses wrong the errors become noise creating. Sound isolation is basically ear plugs. Sometimes in a noisy environment I put these in my ears intending to play some music and even before the music starts, the din of the background noise disappears to provide a silent sound stage for my favorite tunes.

The wires of these go up and behind your ears. This is a great arrangement. I have another set that is of the same sound isolation type, but he wires hang down as they typically do. When active like running, the wire bounce and conduct sound to the earphones. The SE215s don't have this problem since the wire weight is supported by your ear. At first it can be hard to figure out how to get them in. I wouldn't get on a plane without them."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for working out as well as general listening.

- Great sound quality
- VERY noise isolating, almost dangerous. Wore these in NYC subways where it's super noisy when trains are passing by and you don't hear much noise from the outside. These are not earbuds, these go inside your ears - big difference when it comes to noise isolation
- Durable - wires seem thick and strong
- Well reviewed on audiophile sites
- When working out, they are worn looped around the ear so they don't move when you exercise or run. Seem sweatproof so far"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried these with my Shure 315 earpieces and they did not sound good at all, very tinny. I switched to my S 215 earpieces and they sounded MUCH better. It seems they’re most compatible from a sound standpoint with the Shure 215 model earpiece"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound technology, the usefulness of the device is mediocre. Shoving the hard awkward ear pods in my ears and attempting to loop the messy wires over my ears is pretty annoying. Microphone is badly placed and not outdtanding, so not great for calls. Bluetooth synch to devices is slightly below average."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these in and couldn't wait to unpack them because of all the great reviews of it. I was hesitant because of the reviews that said the one ear would go out, but I love a good pair of headphones and heard these were the best bang for the buck. As an FYI, I have a pair of Klipsch S4i and Monster turbines. (not to mention my gaming headsets: Logitech g9930 and Razer carcharias. I like headphones!) So, here's the rundown:

Upon receiving the package, it was pretty cheap packaging. I was hoping most of the money went into the headphones instead of the packaging. Don't get me wrong, it was in a standard carboard box with plastic to keep it in place. I guess after getting a pair of monster turbines where the packaging was amazing, I am a little spoiled. Some might say this is a crazy thing to judge about, but I know that if they care for their product, they will put care into the packaging as well.

Upon opening the package, I noticed the left ear foam piece was melted and looked nothing like it was supposed to. Maybe it has been sitting in the head too much? It wasn't that big of a deal since I knew I wasn't going to use the foam tips anyway. I much prefer the rubber ones that are included with the packaging. It was a pain to get the tips off and the rubber ones weren't that great to put on either, but it wasn't incredibly difficult.

Putting on the earphones did prove to be a little difficult at first trying to figure out how they are supposed to go on. Once I did, I found that these earphones provided such a tight fit I couldn't hear much around me even without any music going. For me that's a bonus, but for some they may not.

It does come with a small zipper case with a metal carabiner clip on it. I guess it would help with travel when you're not listening to them. The chord is Loong! and very nice! It also comes with an earwax cleaner for your earpieces which is always nice to have.

Now, the sound: these earphones sound pretty amazing. The highs are clear and crisp, the mids are okay and the bass is pretty nice. I like a lot of bass in my music with bass drops and such and this hits them with a nice punch. For the price, these headphones are better than just about anything else out there at the same pricebreak of ~$100. I would get them again if the need ever arose. Still breaking them in, but they sound pretty nice out of the box already."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these is good. However, the way you have to put these in and take these out is pretty inconvenient and hard to get used to. Also, I tried multiple tips, but they just ended up hurting my ear canals after wearing longer than an hour."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I actually review this item I want to mention the seller ""The Variety Spot"" that I purchased from Amazon through. They are the BEST! I recently purchased a Rolls PM351 personal monitor and got the Mee Electronics headphones that appeared in the 'also purchased' section of the listing. Those headphones could not handle the sound, particularly the bass coming through the unit. I was in a tight spot because I wanted to use the personal monitor for some gigs coming up fast. Through research I found that the Shure PE215 headphones would probably be the best match since they are made for this application. I asked The Variety Spot if they could help me out by shipping ASAP and guess what? It was out the door within a couple of hours and with USPS 3 day priority mail! I received the unit in 3 days and am so happy to be using it in time!

The unit itself is solid. Shure sells some higher models that probably are better but for the price you will probably not find earbuds that can handle something like a stage monitor system as well. I play bass and sing some and so naturally I want those coming through. I tried several headphones including the Mee Electronics, some Smoking Buds that I had lying around, some Sony earbuds and some Monster over the ear headphones that I have. None of them could handle the bass coming through the Rolls PM351. The Shure PE215 earbuds are sometimes slightly overdriven by the bass but other than that they do the trick very nicely. No surprise since they were made for this application. As a bonus they are the best headphones I have for listening to my music from my devices. Very balanced sound with the punchiest bass you will ever find. I believe that Shure also makes a model with a mic if you want to use it with your phone.

For the price you will not beat these earbuds for stage or just listening to music!

Thanks Variety Spot!!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad for the price. I've owned quite a few in ears in the $30-$60 range and I am happy that I paid a little more for these. I am a general music listener and podcast listener. For me, these sounds very good when listening to different types of genres. I listen to a lot of podcast and these do an amazing job at isolating external noises. My boss has snuck up behind me a few times without even trying. I enjoy the extra clarity in these earphones when I compare them to my previous sets. If these we're priced a little more cheaper, I highly recommend them."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use ear bud headphones solely for riding on my motorcycle. I usually have the rubber tipped kind but went with the foam tip for these.

The foam tips block as much outside sound as an actual foam ear plug design to block sound. It's great for wind noise inside my helmet. I find myself turning the volume way down as I can still hear my music while blocking the damaging wind/engine noise, and I can still hear my environment.

They also lay completely flat in my ear, and the cord that wraps around my ear does a great job of keeping the ear bud in place, even in my helmet.

Sound quality is also fantastic for the price. Cord is super durable. I like that the cord is also replaceable/interchangeable.

Definitely recommend."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for an upgrade to my Etymotics which I like very much but were lacking in lower end frequency response. I had listened to the Shure SE 425 and 525's but $400 or $500 for in ear iPod headsets? I'm not cheap but have a problem spending twice as much money for an accessory as I paid for the device. I read a review on the Shure SE215 and decided at $99 to buy a pair. So far they're great! I'm a part time musician so I'm pretty picky about my music. The SE215's have a big sound, perhaps a little bass heavy but since I'm a bass player I like that. Cons: This is not a small in the ear and the design makes you experiment a bit to get the right position and feel. Once in properly you are not going to forget you're wearing a headset. Several people have talked about left ear hiss. So far no problems here but I've only had the set for a few weeks."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is superb, sound isolation is great and natural, and fit is perfect. Removable cord is great in case it breaks, which is very hard do. Can be worn with glasses or goggles quite comfortably, and honestly you could wear these things all day and all night and still not have to take them out.
One trick I use is to run the cord down my back under my shirt; this protects the cord and greatly reduces the chance of snagging on something."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for a long time I had wanted these headphones to use with my monitor system for drumming and they sound great, the package however came a little dirty and with scratches, but the headphones were great they were non damaged and looked perfect. In the beginning it's a little uncomfortable to put on and it takes a while for your headphone to get used to you ear shape, but over time they fall right in place. I really recommend them they do isolate all the noise so I would read the instructions on how to and when to where them if on the go. For safety reasons. But the sound quality is great everything is clear the bass is incredible. I did expect the headphones to be a little louder, but I guess it just my phone. I really recommend them they are great!!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones to have if you enjoy music quality when it comes to noise isolation , stage , clarity and tonal accuracy. For the price you will be hard pressed to find anything that comes close to the quality of these .."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable and great response, I'm currently using these through an onstage monitoring system and though I'm not adept at this..newer use of technology, I'm accustomed to playing into the onstage mix coming from the band..this product is proving to be quite an asset. Only thing missing is a clip to keep it to your collar and perhaps your belt loop. As advised by our worship drummer, putting the connection into your back pocket reduces possible damage to wires by putting any tension on your pocket instead of the connector. Using the ambient Mike on the monitor allows you to hear people speaking to you and house worship, invaluable when rehearsing because the noise cancelling on this earpiece works really well, lol."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play on stage about twice a month where in ear monitors are used. These block out the sound in the room while giving me clear sound in my ears. The sound quality is what would be expected from SURE and the construction is great. The cord is long enough to wear as in ear monitors and the construction is very durable. They fit and stay in the ears great once you find a foam piece that fits. All kinds of sizes come with these headphones so finding a pair that fits wont require seeking aftermarket stuff. I highly recommend these headphones.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that have great sound and great fit. If you are looking for in-ear wireless headphones that allows you to listen to every instrument then look no further.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One side of my Klipsch S4's went out so I was looking for a replacement around the $100 price range. The headphones primary use will be at the gym and secondarily at an office job. After some online research, I decided on the Shure SE-215. I've had them for a little over a month and I'm happy with my decision so far. Sound wise, I would say that it is slightly better than the S4's because of the foam tips which reduces outside noise. There's a little learning curve getting adjusted to the over the ear placement and the feeling of the foam tips vs rubber tips but it's worked out for me so far.

Pros
- Great sound for the price. Foam tips create a good seal blocking outside noise.
- Over the ear fitment. This took a bit to get used to but it keeps the headphones in place with lots of movement.
- Replaceable cable.

Cons
- Cable is ridiculously long.
- Very difficult to change tips. Changing tips is a chore and shouldn't be as difficult."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just replaced my included Apple EarPods with these Shures and what an improvement.

Previously I've owned Etymotic Hf5, Skullcandy Heavy Metal, Sennheiser 380HD 'phones. The sound is on par with the Etymotics, not as full as my Senns (which are over the ear cans, so not really an apt comparison).

Cable is plenty long. I'm a tall guy so this really nice. Also, it doesn't seem to tangle very easily and the included case is padded, so that's good.

My only real complaint is the lack of included in-line mic and controls. I knew this when buying so not a big deal, but I'll certainly be purchasing the music control add-on soon (but the lack of a clear version is holding me back, are you listening Shure?)

Definitely a worthwhile purchase for $100."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a replacement for a pair of Klipsch X10s that had their flimsy cable die just out of warranty. Got sick of replacing expensive IEMs over this issue. The Shure line is the only remotely affordable option with removable cables, and they're not bad at all aurally - but there are some immediately obvious drawbacks.

Pros:
Superb sound isolation and secure fit makes them ideal for commuting
With a proper seal, they sound great for the price - nice bass that doesn't overpower
Removable, thick cable

Cons:
Awkward insertion process
The monitors themselves are large enough to feel uncomfortable in the ear after several hours
QA issues - had to send back a pair due to (apparently common) issues with sound dropping on the left ear.
Fat plug won't fit most phone cases"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"the sound is great on these earphones, but the problem is after a few months of use, the right ear driver started to make static noises. When I tried pulling out the left ear driver from the cable, the ear driver socket was probably too tight and ended up pulling out the wiring inside of the driver.
Also, the paint for the logo completely faded away. These earphones are not well-made. At least not the pair I received."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Technically a very good product. I have a little trouble keeping the buds in my ears.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have warm sound without muddiness and decent soundstage (compared with my other buds) with good isolation.

The wires are rotating in the earpiece housing so one needs to pay some attention while putting them on.
Memory foams provide very good seal and easy to put in and several sizes are provided as well.

Unfortunately, with the good seal comes its bad side - no heat/vapor transfer.
My ears become itchy in about 1.5-2 hours of listening and hot in about 2 more.
The wire has no microphonics that I can hear so I think these make pretty decent physical activity phones (much better than my prior sennheiser buds)."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these better than the more expensive units. For casual listening the set great. More bass than the 315, and 425 I have tried. The highs are a bit flat to me, and the midrange a bit flatter when compared to the 425. For listening to rock on my smart phone these really fit the bill. The weak link is my phone."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement to a busted pair of Klipsch S4's. Sound quality overall is better than my S4's were. Highs are crystal clear without any harshness. Mid and low frequencies come in very clear as well, but I feel these lack the bass response of the Klipsch. Not a massive difference, but something to consider. If you like a lot of booming bass you'd probably be better served with Beats headphones. I am really enjoying the sound quality and clarity though. I'm hearing things that I never heard before in my music which is quite fun. I do wish they had more bottom end response though, maybe I'll play with the equalizer on my device to see if I can make up for it.

These took a bit to get used to the fit. I looked like a goof for the first 10 minutes trying to figure out how to put them in, but after a few tries you get better at it. Once they're in they are very secure. Outside noises are virtually eliminated, as the contact points are made of a material similar to a really good pair of ear plugs. That's a huge plus for me, as I was looking for something to make noisy flights more bearable. There are multiple sizes included to fit any ear. That said, the driver itself is rather large. I have ""Colbert ears"" where one sticks out and the other is more flat. My flatter ear ends up hurting a bit from the driver pressing on it. No problem with my stick-out ear. Kind of hard to explain, and your results may vary. Last note about the fit is that these have to be put in a certain way, meaning that it does take a bit of your concentration to install them. You can't just walk out of a coffee shop with your cappuccino in hand while installing them with your other.

Another great thing about these headphones is the cable which is replaceable and rather thick. I've destroyed a number of headphones from frayed or damaged cables, and I feel these won't be susceptible to that same damage. Also, the cable seems to be shielded. Meaning when you're walking you don't get ANY noise interference from cable movement or the cable knocking against things (your body, your arm, etc). The Klipsch were HORRIBLE with this.

Overall I think they're good and I'd recommend them over the Klipsch S4. Sure they look a bit strange and require more effort to put in your ear. But they are much clearer, better built, and have much better sound isolation. Minus one star for the strange fit and slight lack of low end."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected to love these IEM's based on all the rave reviews out there and my previous experience with Shure phono cartridges and microphones. Unfortunately, I found them quite uncomfortable, and their housings had a tendency to fall out of my ears. None of the supplied tips seemed to seal well with my ear canals, resulting in weak bass response. The black-colored foam tips are extremely soft, and they take a long time to expand again once compressed. The rubbery tips are more manageable but did not seal well. This fact combined with the stiff cords looped over the back of my ears caused these IEM's to fall out regularly. Plus, they take several seconds longer to get situated in your ears compared to normal (i.e. non-IEM style) earbuds. IMO, the Monster Turbines and NuForce NE-700X earphones are superior sounding for less money and provide superior comfort than Shure's SE-215, which I have returned."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I evaluated many in-the-ear options before settling on the Shure line. In fact I tried a few and each time, the cabling failed long before I thought it should. Shure solved the failed cabling issue by making the cables reliable and user replaceable. I've replaced the cable once in about 2 years. Once you install these correctly with the proper seals, they work great at sealing out the environment while remaining comfortable for hours of use. I am considering a second pair to replace another brand who's cabling has failed and is not replaceable. Recommended."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are fantastic! I workout around 6 days/week and switched from the Power Beats by Dre, as much as I disagree with Beat's products... I liked the fact that the Power Beats were stationary, and sweat proof, as I am a heavy sweater...

Initially, the SE-215's are a bit tough to break in, but once they are, the sound is fantastic. The noise cancellation feature is spot on, almost to the point of it being dangerous when I run in the city. The frequency response and power output are combined to produce some great sound. The cord is a bit bulky for a set of earphones cord, but it doesn't bother me.
Shure is a great brand for audiophiles on a budget.

The good: Headphones sound good for the price, and fit snug, once broken in.

The bad: Mid range is a bit lacking compared to low's and high's. Also, nearly impossible to take off ear foam components... Since they are made of memory foam, when I squeeze them and try change them, I end up squeezing the foam so hard that it completely flattens out, resulting me to stop trying to pull the immobile ear bud from the headphones themselves. I like the memory foam, and the stock size is probably my size, but this is very frustrating."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(Original review from May 2014, updated January 2015)

I'm a runner who sweats heavily. I originally ran using Etymotic ER-4P earphones. My first ER-4P from 2003 had a stiff wire. I ran in extreme weather, like heavy rain, and it never failed. The triple-flange silicone tips were essential to keep moisture from damaging the earphones, something other brands didn't offer. I was set with the Etymotic brand. But after 3 years, the wire failed, which was understandable. I sent it in for repair. It came back with a new style of wire. A fragile, twisted type, and it was nowhere as good as the original stiff wire. It now failed yearly. I sent it in each time, and it cost about $80 to repair. I got another ER-4P so I could use one while the other was being fixed. I loved the sound that much! One day, I ended up needing to send both in for repair at the same time. I put both away, and decided to try a cheaper model.

I got the Etymotic HF5. It cost about $90 on Amazon. It had that great stiff wire, and used the same triple-flange silicone tips. In the gym, it sounded just as good as the ER-4P model! Sadly, its wire failed in less than a year. I called Etymotic and was told it would cost $80 to repair. So I put it with my two broken ER-4Ps. Why not just pay $10 more and get a new one? So I did. Well, its wire failed within a year. I was so very careful with it, too.

So desperate to keep using Etymotic earphones, I got the $30 EREK-5, a kid's model which has a volume limit to protect your hearing. It used the same silicone tips, which is why I got them. But these sounded so awful, I had to just put them away.

So in May 2014 I was prepared to send in my Etymotics for repair and just live with their fragile nature. But I came across this Shure model, which had the same type of silicone ear tips, and, I couldn't believe it, a detachable cable! Plus the cable costs only $20? I had to take a chance on this, so I bought it. For a little over $90, it was barely more than repairing one of my Etymotics. I also bought a spare cable and silicone tips, so I was all set.

When I got the earphones, I noted a few things. The cable is quite long, so I thought it would be cumbersome while exercising. Also, I had to practice putting these on a few times to get used to it. It's a little awkward at first. After pushing it in your ear, you have to wind the wire over the top, then down the back of your ear, and squeeze it a little for a custom, secure fit (the wire keeps its shape when you take it off, which is a plus). But these sound so good while exercising, I happily adjusted to the wire length and the quirky wire-around-the-ear business!

In the gym, I use this Shure model, plugged into a Sony SBH20B bluetooth piece (which is a tiny 1 inch square). Clipped to the back of my shirt collar, it works wirelessly with my Samsung Galaxy tablet.

After each workout, I take off the silicone eartips (to keep them from stretching out and becoming loose-fitting, which is when you toss them out) then wind the earphones around my hand, and put it all into a rigid camera case (rather than the included soft case - it's a habit I formed while using Etymotics). I originally took apart the whole Shure earphone to let them dry, but have gotten lazy and just take off the silicone tips. Now and then I'll get a crackling noise in the left or right earphone, so I take it apart, wipe the connectors, put it back together, rotate the earphones at the connector joint a couple of times, and it's all good again. It's my fault for not taking it apart to dry every day, but it's still working great, despite that!

When I first got these earphones, I of course had a bunch of Etymotics silicone tips, and they're kind of expensive, so I didn't want to waste them. Thankfully they fit, so I got to use all the tips up, and are now using the Shure tips.

After 6 months of daily sweaty abuse, these Shure earphones are working like the very first day I got them. Still have the backup cable in its original packaging! Had I been using my Etymotics in the gym, I'm certain I'd be sending them in for repair by now. This Shure model can withstand all my sweat, all the daily winding/unwinding, so for those of you who want great sounding audio during your exercise sessions, I highly recommend this Shure model. The best earphones I have ever used in the gym! I will edit this review the day my earphones fail and I have to swap the wire. I'm betting it'll be the end of 2015, or sometime 2016. That would be awesome, but even better if it never failed, which might happen, since the wire is so stiff!

To sum up for exercising audio fanatics:
- These sound just as good as Etymotics ER-4Ps while you're in motion. Sitting quietly on a chair, sure, the Etymotics sound better. But while exercising? Yes. These sound fantastic!
- The earphones detach from the cable. A huge, huge benefit, as the cables are always the thing to fail. $20 for a spare cable that you can swap out instantly? It doesn't get any better.
- Triple-flanged silicone ear tips! These are the best for exercising, and I think besides Etymotics, Shure is the only other one that has these.

My highest recommendation, get these earphones, a spare wire, spare tips, and enjoy your workouts!

PS - I just checked out the current Etymotics ER-4P being sold on Amazon. They still have the fragile, twisted wire. I'd buy another in a heartbeat if they changed it back to the old style. So sad :("

Everyone thinks they are comfortable, and they sound great for our application. Come with foam and silicon ear plugs of 3 different sizes. The silicon ones really help isolate sound."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to replace a pair of the Beats Tour earbuds that had to be replaced under warranty TWICE before I owned them 6 months. Please, don't let my lack of judgement then affect my credibility for this review. I have erred. To err is human...these Shure SE-215 earphones, however, are divine.

Construction: The wiring is a little heavier-duty than I expected, with robust connections at the joints. Would imagine that it'd take quite a bit of roughhousing/abuse to cause a failure - I expect no problems here. The actual driver construction seems strong enough - I can see the glue joints on the plastic enclosure, but I cannot feel any seam.

Materials: Again, the wiring seems rather robust, although I'd have preferred a slightly less tacky insulating material used as they tend drag a little bit. The driver enclosures seem to be built of a pretty robust plastic. I opted for the clear ones, which don't necessarily look rock-solid, but I imagine its just a case of being able to see the little bits and pieces that makes them seem less than they are.

Sound: Everything sounds crisp - I listen to just about everything through them (crappy brostep through Wu-Tang Clan through Dave Matthews), and the quality of the reproduction is more than great. There seems to be no over-emphasis on specific tonal ranges (unlike my prior Beats), and there seems to be ample range across the entire...the lows hit low, the highs hit high, and everything just sounds smooth. Kinda sucks, but I'm gonna have to get rid of some of my 128 kbit/s files - I can noticeably hear the squishy cymbals and muffled bass now. They also tend to isolate external noise very well too, especially with the foam ear sleeves.

Fit: Comes with a variety of different ear sleeves and sizes...I'm a big fan of the ""memory foam"" type. The over-ear part contains a piece of paper clip type wire that is bent to adjust the fit and feel; I have mixed feelings toward this because its simply too pliable - it seems that every time I take them off and put them back on, I have to re-adjust the fit to keep them right. Unfortunately, that's gonna be responsible for 4-stars instead of 5. I would love to see a more robust metal wire that doesn't bend and flex so easily. Even better, I'd love to see a hardened sleeve material over the ears that can be heated with a hairdryer to shape and retain rigidity when cooled. Wishful thinking...whatevs.

Features: I'm a huge fan of the attachment point between the wiring and the driver - I've owned too many earphones/earbuds over time that I've had to replace because the connection between the two was broken. If such a tragedy occurs here, you're telling me that I can simply buy a new wire and plug it into the driver and have it work?! Sold.

Overall: I love them. They sound great, the feel great, they fit great. They fit comfortably and snugly under my motorcycle helmet, and I can actually hear my music too. All in all, I STRONGLY recommend these."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"really nice sound with a bump in the mids. I use these as monitors on stage and they are very comfortable. The cable is protected well and the plug has extra padding that might get in the way of some smartphone cases, but that really shouldn't be an issue considering what these were designed for."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound very good. I'm using them with the Comply P series. The sound is excellent; no frequency range drastically overpowers another. I wouldn't call them neutral, they are a little on the bright side. The cord is amazing and sturdy and doesn't pick up static or movement. I use these while working out and they have been great so far. I doubt they are sweat proof but they've held up fine so far but we'll see."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had it for a week now. So far, I like it.
SOUND QUALITY: It is quite good, especially the clarity of the sound. I am able to hear a lot of details.
NOISE ISOLATION: You need to try different ear buds to find out the ones that fit your ears. Once you have the right one, the noise isolation works very well.
BASS: Like many other reviewers said, the bass is not overwhelming. You can barely feel the bass when the volume is low. Once I found the right ear buds, the bass seemed to be a bit more prominent, but still not satisfying. I would give it a 5 star if the bass is a little better."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't have room for my Bose bluetooth headphones on my last business trip, so I reached for these small earphones. It was my first time really using them, and it was a very nice experience. They block out sound passively, through the design of the earphone in your ear tunnel. Even with no music playing, the difference on a plane without them is drastic. They do not require much power to get a good sound level. The quality of the sound is pretty good."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like listening to music when I work .... keeps me on task. These headphones do a great job blocking out the ambient noises of an office. I listen to a lot of jazz and classical music and I must say that the sound clarity is very good. Takes a bit of a getting used to in placing the earphones but once you find the right fit they seal wonderfully. the cord is tough but pliable. They do get a bit tiresome after wearing for a few hours. I started to notice them about 3-4 hrs aft e r continuous wear..... but I think most earphones get prretty uncomfortable after long periods like that. I personally have no complaints and would recommend these.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally purchased these headphones to use with my iPhone 6s and TV.

The only difference between the two packages was the type of removable cable (Mic & Remote).

The build quality seems really sturdy and I really don't forsee any problems with the cables or plugs in the near future. But even if I do, I'm happy that I can just replace the cable because they detach from the earphones. I've had to get rid of too many headphones in the past because of broken cables or plugs."

This is about my 4th pair. I use them with my iPod when I'm at the gym. Shure is a name I've trusted since my teen years singing in night clubs. I'm now 69."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my SE215 earbuds for over a year and still love them. When I compare my earbuds to earbuds friends have bought for more then $250, my earbuds sound better all around. Their earbuds sound more crisp at the higher frequencies, but overall the whole sound experience is better with mine. The base on the SE215 is really good, haven't found any earbuds that sound better, base wise, then mine for around the same price. The quality base is the most noticeable thing I hear when I compare my earbuds to more expensive, non-Shure brand, earbuds.

Before I bought my SE215's I was really worried about all the reviews that say the cables go bad after a short time. Mine still have no problems whatsoever and I have been listening to them for at least 2 hours a day for over a year. I take really good care of my earbuds and I use the carrying case whenever I transport them. I even through them into my laptop bag everyday on my way to work and still haven't had any issues.

Bottom line, if you are wondering whether to get these headphones, just get them. You will not be disappointed. After listening to my SE215's I have had friends go buy a pair the next day because of how much they loved the sound quality of these earbuds for the sub $100 price.

Cons: The only complaint I have about these headphones is they can be a little uncomfortable after wearing them for more then three hours. I never have had a problem with my right ear, but my left ear will start to get sore after about three hours and if I leave them in for more then six or seven hours I will have to remove the earbud from my left ear because it can really start to hurt. I don't listen to them for more then four hours very often, so it isn't a big deal. Even with this problem I would still buy another pair in a heartbeat because the quality sound that is produced from these headphones is amazing. Also, I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you are looking for something to wear while sleeping.

Last note, I have a sound system at home with Sonas Faber Toy Towers and a REL T-9 sub. I bought this sound system for listening to music and not home theater (though the T-9 is geared for home theater). I've listened to other high end music sound systems, including the Alexandria 2 from Wilson, and can easily hear the difference between these high end systems and other systems. You can definitely get earbuds that sound better then the SE215's, but the only earbuds I've ever heard that sound better are the higher end Shure earbuds and other brand earbuds that are well over $200 dollars.

Hope this review helps!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these for over two weeks and I can say that I can clearly here a difference between these and the standard earbuds that came with my iPhone 6. I like that fact the it come with different styles and sizes of ear tips plus that the cable is replaceable. They are very lightweight and after you get used to how to put them on the are comfortable for long periods of use 4+ hours. The lows are present and well balanced the mids and high sound smooth at moderate volume but can be a bit harsh past 85% volume. Overall great headphones for the price
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in-ear headphones I have owned yet. Amazing sound, very stable in your ears (especially for jogging), and completely isolates your sound as well as a non-noise cancelling headphone can do.

I have had mine for two years before I needed to get them replaced, but it is mainly due to my usage and less to do with the product. Over time, if you use these for running, sweat can cause corrosion in the connector from the cord to the monitors. I plan on buying another pair of these strictly for office/home/travel use and a seperate one for running, otherwise I believe these would have lasted much much longer."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Moving from a set of regular earbuds to these earbuds is like night and day. The sound quality is amazing, and you'll hear the little details you've never noticed in songs that you've heard a hundred times. They have foam earplug-esque tips to comfortably create a seal in your ear, which also helps by eliminating most background noise. I wear them for about 5 hours at a time, and I haven't had any discomfort like with other earbuds."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, but too much of a pain to insert and remove. Would be fine if you plan to leave them in for long periods of time without a need to take them out, but since they deafen you to the outside world, you'll need to take at least one out even to have a quick conversation with someone next to you. I ended up returning them."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of the Shure SE215-K Sound Isolating Earphones.

Summary - If you are looking to go between the average seat of quality earbuds and professional, these are your thing. I have purchased and tried the bose sound true, the Audio Technica ATH CRK10's and tried several other types and these in my opinion are the best so far even though they were not near the most expensive. When I tried these, I realized that my best sounding set still were not giving me all the depth and clarity my devices had to offer. You can literally hear all ranges very clear and unlike most other earbuds, each range comes through balanced. There is no distortion in the bass and yet it is strong but not over powering like some. (No muddyness and no tin type highes.)

I am not going to recap the specs listed on the product page as you can read them there. One thing I have learned from buying earbuds is that you really can not go with specs. You need to try them out and use your own ears.

What I love above these.
-Amazing clarity, detail and solid bass.
-They are very comfortable, are not heavy and feel nice in the ear allowing me long term use without having sore or hot ears.
-Came with a carry case with a clip so I can clip my gear and go.
-Does not require an amplifier or DAC. So unlike some Inner Ear Monitors, you can use these on common devices like your phones, Ipod, etc.
-Has detachable cables. Most earbuds you have to look for warranty or replacement if you damage a cord. These you can just go purchase a replacement cable which are not expensive. (I have also seen replacement cables for these which add in the microphone so you can use for hands free calling on your phone and have seen cables that will make these wireless - blue tooth.) So lots of options in terms of cables.

Cons
-The over the ear design will take some getting use to if you never used like me. It takes me a little bit to get them in my ears and positioned how I like them. So if you want a set to just pop in, this type may not be for you. The design however keeps them in place and sounding great even if you are very active."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: for $100 bucks you seriously can't beat this sound quality. it is the best. I used to have shure e4c but when they broke I decided to buy cheaper ones and since I know and trust shure for their customer service I went with them again this time with 215. This headphones delivers quality sound at the cheapest entry price for any In Ear Monitors. durability, sound quality, packaging, customer support all is best of the breed. Enough said, i'd pick this pair over etyomotic , bose, logitech, ultrasound any day (and I say this cuz I've tried all of those brands).

Bad: the fit on this headphone is weird (unlike e4c) and subjective. If I get the right fit, then it feels as if you dont even have a headphones on and that is the good part, however when you don't get the right fit, you just are left struggling and it may even hurt your ears (not pleasant). Because the fit is so weird, it does take good 1 min to put it on correctly and takes some effort to take it out. For something as used as earphones this shouldn't be the case. But again other than the FIT i don't have any complains with this pair, hence 4 stars.

Update 9/13/2013: As originally suspected, it still hurt in my ears after prolonged (10-20 mins max) use. No matter how I put it on, with whichever sleeve, its a problem. However still best durability and sound quality for $100."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great in ear. What you'd expect from shure. My 1 less star is due to the clear color not remaining clear for long, and I take care of my gear. Would purchase black next go round. I'm live 3x a week. These make beats look like junk. Excellent fit, very customizable."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No complaints with sounds quality, but that should be expected to some degree from 100$ ear buds. Popping and clicking started 6 months after purchase though, which is a real bummer. This is my PC set, so I don't even take this set out and about. In general I look for at least 12 months of good quality from any pair of earbuds I buy. Shoot, I even have a couple of pairs of 20$ panasonic buds that have lasted almost 2 years on the move every day. Quality is elusive with ear buds, and for that I'll have to keep looking somewhere else."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great. I use them for video editing as well as blocking out the noise of my roommates when I am trying to work and they all get home. It's really important that you crimp the cable and pull it tight. at the base of your neck to ensure the best fit
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"That neck rest on the cord is awfully shaped and shifts from one side to another, audio quality is the exact same as the original se215s, I wish they'd incorporate an app and software updates to add battery levels and modify the voice that mimics the one as Bose. Not bad for the spare headphones I occasionally misplace around the house."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was uneasy purchasing these but now that I have them and use on stage with a large horn band they are awesome. Just the right amount of mids and highs and not too mush bass in them. they have multiple ear buds to make them comfortable with any ear fit
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Feel very nice in your ear once you can figure out how to wear them. They are a little awkward to figure out how to get them placed in your ears. The over ear wires are a little stiff to wrap over the top of your ears. Hopefully they will break in and feel better. The sound is good. More bass than the Etymotic Research earbuds that I have been using. These sound great, just different than the Etymotic. The seal is good with the memory foam tips. Ambient noise is greatly reduced and the foam is very comfy."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I have owned these buds since October 2011 according to my purchase history with Amazon. These are the best buds that I have ever owned. I have previously owned a set of EC2's and they were great until I packed them with out their case and cracked the plastic housing of the drivers. Then I bought some Bose ear buds and hated them. They didn't fit properly and even with the different tips I couldn't get a comfortable experience. After some research I decided to get these that were billed as 'In Ear Monitors'. I am not a performing musician or even a serious hobby player but I have seen artists using these and similar ones in the past so I bought them. They are amazing. Sound quality is clear at very low levels and do not distort at high levels. They have even forced me to turn on the volume limit on my Iphone so that I don't cause permanent damage. Like others have posted these are not meant to be used when you have to have some situational awareness like when biking or out in public in general. I have found that I use them most often when I am at home and don't want to disturb others with loud music or when flying. Despite previous reviews the case, alb eight a soft one, not only holds the buds but also replacement tips as well. One thing I LIked was the different tips that the unit ships with. It allowed me to customize and find the perfect fit and order replacements here on Amazon. With my EC2's I would often find that if I left the buds not in their case I would loose the nibs. My SE215 buds I replace only whenever they have accumulated too much wax. (In ear headphones and ear health is something for another review). These phones have worked flawlessly and I have even take to using them in Garageband. The long cord allows me some movement and like another reviewer stated you can take them out of your pocket while wearing a jacket and not worry about it.
So this is why I finally got around to posting....

I no longer have a good connection on my plug. Something happened seemingly overnight and I have to manipulate the plug to get clear sound. A phone call to Shure and they want me to send in the unit, drivers and cable to test. I was apprehensive at first because I was out of warranty and just wanted to buy a cable but they said they would test everything for me. I have shipped my favorite Earphones ever off to Shure to be evaluated. Under current pricing if it is only the cable I will get my phones back for $16. Not to shabby. I will update once I get my buds back."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well spent with this price range. Excellent noise isolation, punchy bass, solid mid, appropriate treble, low distortion and broad stage, its sound impresses me even without burning in. The clarity needs improvement but what else do you ask for in view of this price? In my opinion,it performs electronics best. My other suggestion is that you'd like to get a pair of black color instead of clear one. 'Cause clear color in real looks like electrician's tools. And you'd need an additional hard case. Its attached case is too soft to protect this IEM."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from Apple ear buds. These blow them out of the water in terms of sound quality. Sound stage is amazing, highs, mids, and lows are all there. Once you fit them correctly (with the provided foamies), these are incredible noise isolating IEMs. I work downtown in a major city and I can hardly hear traffic between songs when walking about.

Pros:
- Sound quality is excellent; once fitted correctly, they produce an incredible sound stage, including bass.
- Noise isolation is excellent; I can hardly hear traffic let alone colleagues in the cubes next door.
- Nice length of cable; not too long but not too short. Travel case is handy when not in use. Monitors are detachable.

Cons:
- The stiff over-the-ear ""memory line"" that molds to the back of your ear takes getting used to. Putting these on and taking off takes a decent effort in comparison to non over-the-ear types of IEMs."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these specifically as an IEM and will not use my typical earbuds again for this purpose. I am pretty new to singing in a band. I am a trained classical singer and choral director with a degree in music. Using an IEM is quite a different experience in sound than I have experienced before, but of utmost importance if you are in a band (floor monitors are worthless). I have used several other earphones (including my Bose), but these are ABSOLUTELY the best when singing in the band. I am still getting use to putting them in my ears (getting easier each time I use them), but once in they are secure and the quality of the sound is excellent. If they are in your ear correctly, they are feel great. I have had them in for close to 6 hours one ear felt perfect, but one was rubbing and needed to be adjusted in my ear. It was a simple fix. You really have to see these as a piece of equipment that have to be used correctly for the best benefit. If used in that capacity and given a short amount of time to 'learn' how to use them I am sure you will be as completely satisfied as I am. The price can't be beat for the quality. I would not wear these as an everyday earbud, but could see them used for running and/or working out."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,My nephew recommended these for me as I have very low tolerance for noise and couldn't find any earphones that would truly cancel noise. I hesitated between these and the newer ones but he told me that these would do just fine.... wow is right! You do not need to have the music at high volume to cancel what's next to you on the plane or in the house.... These are indeed the best music quality and noise cancellation... they come with a nice container and several sizes of M L and S ear piece another bonus bc I have small ears and the Iphone ones really hurt me without even cancelling the noise... I got them in black so they match my MotoG phone and I stream Amazon Prime music.... am in heaven! Thank you for an incredible product! Oh ps. I removed a star bc really with all the design software available to the company they can make directions a LOT more user friendly they were horrible I had to youtube the stuff.....
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones,
I thought I had great quality headphones before purchasing a pair of SE215 Shures. Well constructed for the price range, Many headphones at this price range do not come with the removable cable, which is a feature I love. You have the freedom to replace a cable if it is damaged or to purchase an aftermarket cable for the IEM's. Fantastic feature!
The IEM's themselves are solid, and give fantastic sound clarity and quality. Those suggesting that there is no base to these headphones need adjust their player/computer settings. These give out a generous amount of base, I am new to micro-drivers so I don't know if there is a break in period. But two weeks of heavy listening and these are great. The sound is very clear, very distinctive I can pick out each sound from a song and which direction it is coming from. The base is more then enough for any audiophile unless you like The Bass drowning all the other sounds.
They are a little tricky to put in, yes. And there is a small learning Curve to this. But most people who are getting $100+ pair of IEM's or Custom IEM's are going to be listening for long periods of time, not taking them in and out every five minutes. I believe an after market cord without the mold-able ""ear cuffs"" would cut some time off inserting them, for me anyways. But for the quality I can deal with it.
All in all these are a very great set for the price, and give off an amazing sound at the $100 range."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going through a pair of ear buds approximately every 3 months, you know the kind that you normally find in checkout lines and impulse buy points in a store.
Then I bought my first pair of Shure, and two years later I'm replacing them with a second pair. I can't get into dB ratios, bass depths, etc, etc, etc, but I can tell you these are well made and handle everyday commuter use very well.
The sound is great (talk radio and podcasts mostly) and they do cancel out annoying traffic noise.
Stop buying the $9 pair at the grocery store and do yourself a favor. These are great."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was searching for an earbud that would help to filter out ambient noise at work and also have some great sound. I found it with the Shure SE215-K's.

I have a nice pair of Sennheiser over the ear HD565s but I don't like to wear them to work because if working in close proximity to someone, they have a good amount of audio leakage from the drivers which can annoy people in the vicinity.

I originally was looking for something with active noise cancellation to allow me to better focus at work, but after much research, decided to go with earbuds which would allow for noise isolation. I was not disappointed with my choice.

While it feels somewhat silly paying around 100 dollars for earbuds when there are others on the market available at a fraction of the price, I didn't want to listen to tinny music with a bad soundstage. With a massive amount of great reviews and top 5 list showings, I decided upon the SE215-K's.

The earbuds are a bit of a pain to get used to in terms of ""screwing"" them onto your ears, but once they are their and you've picked the proper tips, your going to be in your own world. They block out a good amount of ambient noise and don't require a large amount of volume to put you in total seclusion. Sometimes this can be a disadvantage, because they are small, people may not realize that you cannot hear them and will talk to you while you sit there an enjoy your favorite albums until you notice them looking at you in disbelief because your not responding.

I also use these when doing outdoor work. While this may not be the best thing for my hearing, I love mowing the lawn and actually being able to hear my music or audiobooks. I often wear them underneath some over the ear protection so that I don't have to listen to them at such a high volume. There is nothing that beats going out with the chainsaw/lawnmower/snowblower and being in your own world while actually getting some work done.

I unfortunately lost my first pair of these while on a business trip and after agonizing for a few weeks about whether to try something else, or go cheaper, I finally caved in and bought a new pair, this time the clear ones to change it up a bit. These are great enough to warrant a second purchase!"

Paired them with EATFL1-6 triple flange sleeves and they work fantastic!! Cuts wind noise significantly and allows you to hear your music at less than 100% volume. I tested them to 100 mph (empty freeway for short period) and they stayed put with very little wind noise. Unfortunately you don't hear much else either. I've got earbuds with a somewhat better sound reproduction but none would stand up to more than about 30 mph before the wind would severely depreciate the sound. These do sound VERY good. Little heavy on bass, which I like anyway but slightly lacking on treble. Set EQ to treble boost in phone setting and it was better. My biggest problem before was longevity, the remote switch was always out in the wind and the wires would quickly break at the switch connection. These don't have the switch and I wear them wires to the rear with the cinch close to my scalp and the wires drop right into my collar. No whiplash on the wires so they should last a long time. I'm working on finding a remote switch so I can pause my music and adjust volume without digging out my iPhone. Lot's of options there, will try and post an update when I come up with one. I'm very pleased with how these worked out. Update 7/3/17: Using these frequently and they work flawlessly, still extremely pleased with them. Found a remote switch and functionality was greatly improved when riding in a group as it allows pausing my music without removing an earbud or digging out my phone when I want to speak to someone. Won't disclose the product here yet because it is defective and I have requested a replacement."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215 are good earphones, no doubt, but the bluetooth implementation on this cable is terrible. With my phone 2 feet away I get dropouts and, I can't believe this still happens in 2018, the music SPEEDS UP! There is nothing worse for music than speeding up, I'll take a pause or a dropout any day, but making a vocal that I love sound like the Alvin and the Chipmunks is just awful, I'd rather not hear the song if the playback rate can't be kept constant. So these had to go back. I got the Mee Audio X8 instead and the bluetooth is much, much better."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound of these IEMs is disappointing in my opinion. In this review I will compare them to a much cheaper pair of Audio Technica CKS55. The IEMs were tested on a FiiO DAC and on a regular laptop port. While these are definitely better than a pair of Beats or Bose, I only find them marginally better than the cheaper ATH-CKS55. Sound quality wise, the Shure SE215 have a relatively neutral sound, with no genre of music sounding any better than others in my opinion. This is good if you like listening to many different genres, but if you only listen to a couple you may be better served looking for headphones which best fit those genres. I primarily listen to EDM and occasionally metal which the ATH-CKS55 are quite good at. The neutral sound of the Shure seemed to take away from the basslines and drum rhythms from the electronic music, though metal and rock sounded excellent with them. Rap and pop sounded very good along with EDM, but no particular genre made these headphones shine. There are plenty of included earpieces to find a comfortable fit, though the headphones are not good for taking in and out often due to the way in which they wrap around the ear. The earbuds are detachable allowing for easy cable replacement if it gets damaged, and the clear casing looks very nice. Overall these are very nice headphones, however the price tag seems too high for what you get."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. I've owned the wired SE215s since 2010, and have been waiting for a Bluetooth version. The early reviews of these had me a bit worried, but the only thing waiting did was waste time in getting these IEMs in my ears.

They sound identical to my wired SE215s (albeit from the same compressed streaming sources). No problems with Bluetooth at all. Also, not sure if it's just with my Pixel 2 XL, but the phone shows you battery level. I need to try these headphones with other/older devices to see if this shows up. I was also worried that the cable with the battery and control pods would be heavy, but no issues for me yet.

Overall, if you are a fan of this style of Shure headphones, don't hesitate."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was turned off by shure in past. Goofy ear fit, goofy behing the ear wire management, crappy cables, crappy foam buds, and wayyy overhyped. I go through a set of buds once a year and they all cost about 100 bucks. These Shures are better constructed and the included bud choices are excellent. Although the buds can be detached from the wires I havent had any issues with them detaching on their own or with connection interference. The sound is spot on for its price range. Far better than the Shure's of years ago.
BTW I do NOT baby these earphones and theyre holding up just fine and the fit is very very good."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great implementation. I haven't tried the Shure 535, but I was originally going to purchase them. I figured I'd give these a go due to the much lower price and good reviews. I was not disappointed."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to test them out with the in-ear monitor that we use in my band and I was extremely impressed with the sound quality. The sound field is extensive and very nicely balanced in the hi, mid & low frequencies. The bass is punchy and solid without overpowering the other frequencies which, as a drummer, is very important to me. The fit in and around the ear is excellent and provides excellent sound isolation so you hear what's in the ear monitor without being distracted by ambient sound. I let my bass player try them and he absolutely loved them. I also have a pair of Sony MDR7550 pro audio ear monitors which are awesome but, I'll tell you, for the price, you cannot beat these. They are very well designed and the detachable cord is a big plus. I will definitely be buying a few more sets of these! Shure really hit a home run with these bad boys."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to use these in a shop that requires hearing protection. I've tries a few different pairs of headphones that advertise noise isolation and they always come up short. These provide great noise isolation and sound fantastic. Try out a few different sizes of the plugs to figure out what fits right, if they are uncomfortable then you probably have the wrong plugs on. Highly recommend these headphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't go into a long rambling review on these headphones. Bottom line is, they are worth the sub-100 dollar price. The bass is a little lacking, but very well balanced to the overall tonal quality of the ear buds. As a comparison, I also have the Velodyne V-pulse ear buds, and the bass in the V-pulse is much better, but the Shure's are a step above in midrange and high's compared to the V-pulse. This is a great overall value for Shure ear buds. If I had it to do over again I probably would have stepped up to the SE315's."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These sounded great during the first use. But when I tried to change the earphone tip, the plastic post snapped. This was on the first night of ownership.

I ended up returning them and going with a different brand that uses a metal post."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start out by saying that the Shure SE215 saved me. I've been having a lot of problems with my recordings and finding the right monitor balance because my headsets just don't block out enough noise and my other pair of earbuds don't stay in. These earbuds block out a lot more noise than I expected, the lows/highs balance is perfect, and you can't yank these out. Once they're in, they're in. I highly recommend these.

My one and only problem with these is changing out the sleeves. I haven't take off the medium black foam sleeves that came already on these things because I was afraid of breaking them. It seems that if I go to change them, they won't come off. I really don't want to break these and put 100 dollars down the drain. I'm happy with the sleeves that are on there now but if I ever need to change them, it may be a problem. I would appreciate comments on the best way to remove the sleeves without breaking the earbuds. Thanks."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line is you've got to spend quite a bit of money to get a pair of earbuds with significantly better sound quality than these, and then you'll also have to buy a dedicated amplifier to really get the most out of them so, this is just about as good as it gets in these price range.

This little wonder from Shure deliver poweful bass and rich, creamy mids that will put to shame many other similarly (or higher) priced options. The highs could be a tad better, but then again you'd have to spend more in a multi-driver model to get top quality in every range, IMHO.

For those who are considering buying a pair of ""real"" earphones for their portable music devices, let me tell you, go for it! You won't be dissapointed, you guys just don't know how good your iPhone/iPod, Galaxy, or whatever device you use really is until you've tested it with a pair of decent ear pieces instead of the lousy ones that come included with them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great sounding earphones - big improvement over my Shure E3s. Wish I would've got'em long ago.
Using with a Shure PSM400 in-ear system.
Using the included medium black foam sleeves - fit snug for great bass, and stay in! (Used the yellow foam sleeves for ages, they worked good but these much better)
Two other band members got'em also -- they are very happy too."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had countless headphones from Apple, jlab, Bose, Sony etc. Hands down these are the best for the price. The foam is 100% moldable to any ear. The cord is robust and strong with an oversized jack that fits through most cases. The sound is impeccable. Clear at any volume. I wear them 3+ hours a day and my ears aren't sore."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work fantastically!
I've owned a pair of Shure's in the past, however these blow my old pair out of the water.
The foam cushions are my go-to when I want to ignore the world.
my hour commute on the train almost feels too short; whether I'm watching a movie, listening to music, or reading a book, time seems to move quicker, it's much nicer when you don't have to listen to the constant nosies that accompany public transportation.
be warned however: while the noise cancelling feature is nice, it can also potentially be dangerous, you will not be able to hear anything around you, so you should be extra cautious when crossing streets, or walking home."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these as provided in-ear monitors at some of the places that I've drummed. The main church that I play at provides the model a few steps better than these and sounds even better. If you want a pair of quality ear buds or want a budget-friendly in-ear monitor solution, this will do the trick.

Also, as others have said.. Give them a break-in period before developing an opinion. When you get them, just plug them into your iPod overnight with songs going at medium volume. That should do the trick."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to listen to music when I ride my motorcycle, especially on long trips. I went through many different earbuds from different manufacturers before buying these. I wish I would have found these first. The music fidelity is good, most of the wind noise gets blocked out and I can still hear surrounding noises to respond to traffic. I bought the replacement cable so I could adjust the volume or turn off the music."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It takes some getting used to to put these on correctly, and after about a week of use, I still struggle a little to put them on in the dark. Also, the included ear tips didn't fit me very well, medium was a bit too small and the large was a bit too large. I also purchased Comply Tx100 at the same time and with Comply ear tips, all is grand. I had been using Klipsch S4 for a few years until my new puppy chewed them up. These are definitely a step up from Klipsch S4. Twice as expensive as S4, but I feel it's worth it. I had them on during a business trip and they were comfortable and blocked almost all of the airplane noise. I also have Bose QC15 and they are awesome at canceling airplane engine noise, but a bit too bulky and does not block out crying babies. For $100, can't beat the price or the sound quality."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,FYI there is a manual in the case - hopefully this will save you some anxiety when figuring out how to put these in your ear. The buds are not labeled L and R. I felt like I ruined the earbud foam when changing them out for a different size but it popped back into shape after a few minutes. Not sure what I expected after testing them outside and listening to cars drive by but they seem to work better with a tighter in-ear seal.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is very good. They seem a little more bass heavy than the SE210's they are replacing, but have a relatively balanced response. These definitely sound better than any $10-20 headphones I've ever heard. The wireform near the earphones helps provide a secure fit even during exercise. It takes a little getting used to the over-the-ear fit if it's something you aren't used to, but are fine once you get used to it. The variety of eartips help ensure you get a good fit and do a good job of blocking out sound. The cable seems to be relatively heavy-duty while still flexible. There is some cable noise, but is far from a problem. The replaceable cable is an interesting (and I believe good) idea, but is kind of difficult to get the cable properly snapped into the earphones. Thankfully this is something that you will probably rarely do. Overall I would recommend these earphones if you are looking for something in this price range."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My biggest concern with earbuds was sound quality, fit, and noise isolation. These literally are the only earbuds I've seen that do all 3 successfully. If you are still using Apple's earphones and you switch to these your mind will be blown. I used Apple's earbuds one time since 2008 and knew they were terrible, but the problem with most other sets is the fit (i.e. always falling out).

The design of these earbuds is awkward at first, but you get used to it, and once you find the bud that fits your ear you will experience some of the best noise isolation I've experienced (closed headphones included). These went from my every day earbuds for commuting / work / beach, but now they are replacing my Grado SR80s for home use as well.

If you're debating whether not to get these, just do it already. They're light, they sound great, noise isolation is excellent, fit is excellent, and the best part is that they're cheap for the quality.

Only complaint I have is the removal of the ear buds, that was a pain in the ass, but, by default they give you the medium size so you should know right away if you need to swap at all, go bigger, or go smaller; so you should only have to do that once."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far just from having them a few days, I’m seriously impressed. I didn’t expect the quality of noise isolation from them. They come with several sized plugs, as well as both foam ones and rubber ones. I prefer the foam, as they work like earplugs, expanding in the ear and allowing noise isolation. The cord can be bent to conform to the ear, and it feels high quality. Great bang for the buck, hopefully they continue to be such high quality with use. Very happy!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounds and changing the modes of my hp music I get to hear the diff. settings very well.
Good bass and clarity overall and seals were superb.
Fits lightly and easily into ear. Cables are a bit rough to handle perhaps but this could be good to avoid entanglement.
Bought this to compare with my UE at similar price [100usd]. this is much better and wished I got this first!!!
Great entry model for musicians and audiophiles.
I use this for studio drumming and church playing (boxed up drumset)."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these earphones are great sounding. Good bass and a very accurate reproduction of the music that I listen to when I drum. The only reason for three stars is that the sound isolating ear tips don't stay in my ears when I'm drumming. I've tried different sizes and different combinations of ear tips, but haven't really been able to remedy the situation. They're a bit clumsy to put into my ears and for whatever reason the right earphone consistently falls out. If you use these to simply listen to music, they'll be fantastic. For drum-along, they didn't work for me very well."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound quality is superior to many in its class: crisp and clear. I find myself preferring a far cheaper design when moving around, bending over, etc. where the controls are on the earpiece. This is because the controls on these flap around too much. Fine for a walk, but not loud enough and out of the way for much else."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros
-Great sound (I'm going to ignore specifics, there are plenty of reviews on that)
-Awesome, Awesome, Awesome cord. Seriously, this is the best cord I have ever seen
-Good carrying case
-moderately good selection of eartips (the meelectronics mi-6 hi-fi's have 6 pairs that are all very different, these are all very similar)
Con
-the foam eartips are incredibly hard to get off and look pretty bad after being used. I much prefer the silicone tips.

Overall, these are very worth it"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best buds I've owned...stay in place and sound great when out and about. Wouldn't recommend to audiophiles using in a sound isolated space - they're probably not perfect, just good enough for most people in environments with background noise."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones! I purcchased them several months ago now, and I've enjoyed using them as daily users, gym usage, and isolating when studying. The design is great for staying around the ears. The cable is thick and durable and does not have a lot of noise when on clothing nor does it have a lot of wire memory. The sound is balanced with a nice lean to the heavy end to my ears. I love my bass heavy music, but these do a good job of accurately reproducing music without being murky. I have noticed that sometimes the connection on a ear gets loose, but simply pushing the cable back into the ear set solves the problem. :)"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, comes with different size foam inserts. You have to pull hard to get them off, be careful. They block out most of the outside. I use them on long flights for movies and music. Also use them while playing in a band to hear the monitor feeds, they work really well. I also like that the cable can be replaced when it breaks, the headphone part rarely does."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This model sounds excellent. It provides balanced, rich representation of Rock, EDM and classical music, as well as spoken content on podcasts. The bass is clear and deep but not overly pronounced. The high frequencies sound really clear and are balanced well by the mids. Finally, the build quality is better than any portable music equipment I've ever tried. I hope to enjoy these on the go for a long time."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is WOW! These Earphones are incredible! I use them for causally Drumming and they cancel almost all the noise I make. I can almost hear nothing then I put these on. The sound quality on the other hand is nothing too special in my opinion. At $99 this earphones is great at noise cancelling better than most headphones I ever wore, but the sound quality is average. If you are looking for sound quality I would recommend Sennheiser."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic! Previous reviews are correct, it takes a bit to get the fit right, but there are plenty of ear bud options with the unit. It also take a bit getting used to the way they insert, by wrapping around the ear, but once you get used to it, it's really nice and keeps them secure in the ear. I am a bit of an audiophile and have a Linn british HiFi at home with great clarity, so I am usually very disappointed by in ear products. I ride motorcycle on long trips, and so far these are fabulous. With previous in ear units, I would have to have a significant volume to over come the wind noise in my helmet, but with these and the noise cancellation, I can really reduce the volume, and with the way they fit, they stay secure easily putting the helmet on and off. Sturdy construction, nice long cord. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. If you're looking for a quality in ear headphone under $100.00, look no further, GET THESE!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these sound decent. The clarity is what I would expect from a $100 pair of in ear headphones. The real reason I don't give it more stars is because I can't stand the 64"" cable. I prefer working out with in-ear monitors and the cable is just way too long for me to put my phone in my pocket while I work out. I end up getting it caught on just about anything. I thought about upgrading the microphone/remote cable, but after seeing the horrible reviews on those, I'm thinking I'm just going to return these and get something else."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use the Westone UM1s. I broke them (my fault). I tried a pair of Shire 315s and really liked them, but they weren't in the budget. So I ordered the 215s and hoped for the best. I love them. They fit so tightly I can barely hear anything not routed through the monitor. For the first time ever I'm asking the sound engineer for drums. The sound is solid and clear. They're capable of producing more volume than what is probably necessary. They seem rugged enough to last too. Perfect."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: great sound for the price, sturdy construction.

Cons: not comfortable at first, takes a while to break them in, earbuds not small enough for my ears, wires are stiff and not tangle free"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds very good. Not too much treble or too much bass. I really like the sturdy wire that doesn't tangle. Once you learn how to perfectly insert them into your ear canal, the sound that you get has a value of about $200. One downside is if you have them on too long you will hesitate to take them off because then you will have to reposition them. They cannot be stored in the black case they come with...it is too small. Unlike the ad shows, you have to place them over your ears."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I have ever worn, bar none. I've had them for about 2 years now, and they work as well as ever. They haven't even shown the first sign of falling apart or decreased sound quality. How they sit in your ear took a couple of weeks to get used to, but now I prefer it to a 'regular' fitting earbud. On a sound front, They've got great bass, but they balance all of the elements of sound well, unlike the beats I had before.

If you're on the edge of buying these or not, do it. I promise you will not regret it."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow.
That's really all I can say about these magnificent earphones. These beasts are perfect regarding sound quality, durability, and sound-isolation.

SOUND ISOLATION
The sound-isolation is off the charts incredible. These earphones can block out the loudest of sounds including a go-kart engine and even a rock concert. This may be only because my ears can fit perfectly. The earbuds I use on the earphone is the foam-tip earbuds because They provide excellent fitting.

DURABILITY
I read many other review regarding the bulkiness of the cord, but I found it comforting knowing that the cord will almost never break on you. Sure, they can break sometime, everything can, but they can easily be replaced by another cord for $20-30. So far they haven't really provides a problem for me.

SOUND QUALITY
If you have read other reviews, you will have heard that they sound excellent, and I am here to say they sound magnificently astounding. I did an A and B test with. Skullcandy 50/50, Skullcandy Titans, and Audio Technica ATH-PRO5MK2CM headphones, and all of them, above $50, sounded shallow and muddy compared to the Shure se215. The sound changed drastically, and I applaud Shure for this. I'm surprised they retailed these earphones at $100 because they have the quality of the regular $200 price tag.

Overall great sound and isolation. Most people don't like the cord, but I certainly do."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound damn good and they really really do block out sound with the foam ear tips ime, but I feel like Ive had much more dynamic sounding car stereo setups before. Maybe it was the quality of the audio files I consumed? I'm sure they will sound a bit better with higher quality files though. I feel like agent Smith while walking around with these things on in public because they look so amazing and unique imo."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones for my daughter as she is an aspiring worship leader and plays in the student praise band at our church. Since I use a pair of my own, I already knew the fidelity was top notch, clean highs, good bass response, noise cancelling, all the things you need on stage running IEMs. I highly recommend this product. You could spend three times what you spend on these and not improve the over sound quality appreciably. Go with these and keep your money."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought these earphones to use when I drum. After having them for some time now, I want to say that these are great! work great at insulating the sound of the drums in my ears. I like how they feel around my ears, and have no problem with them! music coming thru them sounds great! I always wanted a great pear of earphones for drumming with, now I got them! and I am happy! get these if you are tight on budget. these earphones are AMAZING for this price! I would recommend these!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound pretty good , I use them with motorcycle so with the ambient noise its a little hard to notice quality. a little tricky to put on , but once you get it right they reduce noise more than any ear plugs i ever tried , I really had doubts about the advertised NRR , but it must be true or close to that.
I can have them on for about an hour before they start to cause pain , might be the pressure from my tight fit helmet or the large size foams I use but that the compromise for the noise reduction."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price they are alright. The sound isolation is good but the quality of the sound is a bit dull. The highs are rolled off on these headphones making everything sound a bit soft. Low and mid response sound fine but for the money, i'd definitely look into a different pair. The cable is also very very long making it a pain if you're just listening to music on your phone or iPod. Running or exercise with these on? Forget it.."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Sound quality is terrific with very crisp highs and very clear, if a little shallow, bass
The cable is detachable. In my experience, the ear buds will last well beyond the life of the cables
Wide variety of ear tips made finding a tight seal very easy
Great passive noise cancellation (If you find the right ear tip)
No sound leak at all. Crank these bad lads up without annoying those around you
Cons:
Does not play well with moisture. I wouldn't suggest working out (I broke a pair after about a month at the gym)
Some may find the over-ear cable design to be a tad wonky
Cable lacks remote (In-line remote cables are available though)
Summary:
I have owned earbuds from Beats, Bose, Etymotic, Klipsch, Monster, etc. The SE215's are my favorite buds of all time, and the last pair that came close in terms of sound quality and durability were the Shure SE210's. While the sound recreation is stellar on the mids and highs, heavy-bass lovers may find the 215's to be lackluster. Do yourself a favor, end the search, and just get a pair of these."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product works as described. With the proper size/shape ear-piece, this product will provide great noise-isolation and produce a wonderful range.

A interesting note, if you play a song that has a lot of bass and the sound quality is poor, you likely have a poor seal and will experience less sound isolation and worse audio performance as a result. Be sure to try all the ear fitting to find which works best for you!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic range and durability. The cord is longer than I'm used to, around 4.8' which can be cumbersome to manage if you're using it for mobile phone use as I am. The thick cord also has a tendency to stiffen in the cold, which can make unexpected difficulties in adjusting the cords position during activities."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,They were the poorest wireless headphones I have ever had they weren’t even worth half the money that I spent on them twice they are not sweat resistant and shorted out making them useless
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality. The most impressive part is how well they stand behind their product, I had to send them in, and they were back quickly and without any hassle. Excellent work. (great for motorcycling, low profile, get the in ear style tips)"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a staple in the music performance category. If you are playing live music and your band has in-ear monitor capability, these are the go-to headphones without breaking the bank too much. They have great sound isolation and I find the sound quality is true and raw rather than being colored with tons of bass or something like that, which will give you a false sense of how you and the band sounds."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good set of earphones. I was using them in a church band thru a monitor system. First time I used this kind of system and boy was it nice. Did have floor monitors blaring us so we could hear our instruments. The tip that comes with it isn't the best at sound isolation, it was adequate. I bought some triple flange sleeve but I haven't figured out how to change the tips. I found instruction but I just feel like I'm going to break something. I'm sure I'll figure it out, but guess they won't fall out."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit I'm no headphone connoisseur, but nonetheless I have not been really pleased with the sound quality. I often like to tailor my musical experience by genre (i.e. change intensities of various frequencies) and have found that from very low bass (e.g. hip hop) to very high pitches (e.g. classical music), these headphones have performed pretty well. In terms of sound isolation, they work extremely well and allow me to tune out really easily when needed. Lastly, I LOVE that they wrap around my ears - this means that I can actually wear them and walk around without them falling our of my ears (a big problem for me given my big ears.).

Overall, highly recommended for the given price point."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The detachable joint between the earphone and the audio cable was not machined properly and is loose on my right side. As a result, the earphone can rotate freely at this point which allows the earbud to wiggle out of my ear. This issue is exacerbated when exercising. I will not purchase another product from Shure. Do not recommend for exercise.

Sad to see quality audio packaged in a poorly manufactured product."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these are better than I expected! Amazing sound, great sound isolation, and they are extremely comfortable also once you get the hang of putting them in! I previously owned the Klipsch Image S4s and these blow them out of the water sound wise. Build quality is also top notch. I love that the foam tips are difficult to remove as I've always had issues with them popping off and getting lost in the past with other earphones. I also love that the wire can be replaced without buying a whole new set as that is usually the weakest link. The only downside is that now all of my other speakers sound terrible in comparison :)"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey, we all hear what we hear, eh? Eh?

Not bad, but not as good as a hunnit bucks. I have skull titans (discontinued - $40) that sound about as good to me. I bought these to wear under a motorcycle helmet and although they're a PITA to wind around and into your ears, they do afford a halfway comfortable fit as long as you manage the cord out of the way. I'll probably spring for something with as flat of a profile, but wireless when I break these or run out of patience."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok sound, sub par reliability and expensive replacement parts. I bought these about four months ago. First the flexible earfitting wire in the cable broke, which just made them a little less comfortable. Then the cable itelf stopped working for one side. No problem! I thought I bought interchangeable earbuds for a reason!. I looked online to see the replacement cable was $30 a little to rich for me, I bought some cheaper ones on ebay for half the price. They of course broke which is not the fault of shure, however it is their fault that the plug in one of the earbuds broke, rendering one earbud totally useless. The replacements are almost the price of the full set, so I didn't bother. I first bought these hoping they would be durable enough for me, but the very thing which I had hoped would solve this problem--interchangable parts became to issue due to the clunky unreliable earbud-plug mechanism."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to be my knock-around IEMs (workouts and so on) and was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality. Very nice bass and overall presence alongside good sound isolation makes them ideal for busy environments. But what I can't get past is just how badly they fit... Everyone's ears are different but I've had many different IEMs over the years and these are the first that ever actually hurt. I can't wear them for more than maybe 30-45 minutes without having to take a break since they've rubbed my outer ear raw, the driver is just too long. The overly long and badly positioned memory-wire doesn't help since to get it into a useful position it will then force the back of the IEMs harder into your skin.

Bottom line: very good sound quality for the money, but depending on your ear size/shape you might be in for a painful experience."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sounding Bluetooth cable, SE215 headsets sound good. I use the cable with my SE535 units. The combinations is great and I have a pair of cheaper earphones to use as wired units."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't wear earbuds. If they fit my left ear they don't fit my right ear.

These fit both ear perfectly and are comfortable for up to two hours. After that I need a little break. They also stay put when running.

Sound is Excellent! I haven't tried any $150 plus IEMs but these beat the pants off everything at lower price points. Good clarity and a wide sound stage for such a small design. Its not as punchy in the base as I'd like but the mids and highs are distinct and crystal clear.

Although the base is very much affected by how far I push the rubber part into my ear. Too far and it sounds basier but gets uncomfortable fast.

I lost 1 pair and bought a replacement about a week later. Couldn't be without them and wasn't willing to risk buying a competitor."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tricky at first, but second nature to wear after about a week or two. Full disclosure, my ears did hurt during the first week wearing these 24/7 (I really mean 24/7, I'm doing 10,000 hours of language exposure), but after the first week my ears can handle them mostly all the time (some one-ear usage with shifting which ear gets them). Also full disclosure, I'm not a musical performer, I'm only listening to a device with them so if you're getting these to perform on a stage ALWAYS WEAR BOTH OR YOU'LL DESTROY YOUR HEARING. Otherwise, just listening to second language exposure, it's fine to just listen to one unless you like your music loud, then beware your ""need"" to turn up the volume since one ear vs. two ears makes a ~6 decibel difference.

I also get compliments that they look pretty cool.

4,000 hours with these so far."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Their sound is very good, as advertised. Noise isolation is good. However, the comfort level for me is not very good. I have trouble with the stiff wire that curls around the ear. It's uncomfortable and sticks out like I have antennas on my head. The rubber ear sleeves, even though I keep them clean, cause irritation and itching like no other earphone I have owned before."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially wanted to spend much more on some of the higher end buds from Monster, Sony or even Shure, but I settled on a budget of around $100 to replace a pair of Sonys that cost me about that much six years ago. I decided on these after reading reviews. The first thing I noticed was the more substantial, thick cord. It seems like it will be less susceptible to breaking down and also tangling like the thin cord on the Sonys did.

These earbuds come with a good amount of accessories for fitting and storage. There is a baggie of different ear tips made of silicone and foam. The medium sized foam tips that were already installed seemed to fit great right out of the box and I'm not sure that I will even bother trying anything else. The foam tips seem to create a much better seal than the silicone tips on the Sonys I had...and they stay put. Because of this, the bass response is quite good and the noise isolation is noticeable. Additionally, they come with a zippered soft case. The case is good quality and will be great for storage and travel as I frequently transport my headphones in my gym bag, to work and when travelling.

I am no audiophile, but I wanted something that is above average in terms of quality and sound. For $100 these were definitely worth it. Time will tell how good the quality really is, but I have the feeling that these will last for quite a few years."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I have to say is I got what I paid for. Just a minor inconvenience and that would be that it doesn't seem to hold well when I do calls and play music. It distorted my music, but the call seemed to still do well. Android users won't like that the volume buttons don't actually do much of their functions. I'm sure it works fine with iPhone users, but it seems to lack features when it comes to Android users."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"took a while to figure out how to wear them comfortably. I had just got to the point where I was starting to like them when the left headphone died. I would expect that kind of behavior out of a cheap set of $10 headphones, but these were way too expensive to die in 1 1/2 months. I would have only given them 1 star, but when they worked they were nice.

The support team was very responsive. I returned them and had a replacement ear bud very quickly. The only problem was that shortly after getting a the replacement ear bud, the other one died. Very unhappy when an expensive product like this fails."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just realized I've used this for 5+ hours a week at the gym for 2.5 years. The right earbud is starting to skip, so I wanted to see how long I've had them... No idea why it's starting to skip --- just old probably.. Great product. Lasted way longer than any other earbuds I've ever had. If Shure reads this and hooks me up with a replacement pair, I'd be like, ""bro thank you"""
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In one word, amazing. I use these while riding my motorcycle, and not only do they block out the wind noise, they sound incredible. I am an audiophile at heart, and modified my helmet radio to accept earbuds. I've tried many different options, but these are the best. Comfortable, excellent sound, and low profile."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones because I am a professional musician who often needs to transcribe music from audio recordings. I need something that provides clarity and fine detail so that I can pick apart the many parts of the music. These headphones do an exceptional job! They have a great deal of bass to the sound but it isn't mushy. I've only taken one star away because the headphones are kind of a pain to put onto my ears. It is sort of a process getting these headphones on properly. Maybe there is just a learning curve...
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an earlier model of the same earphones and loved the sound and fit. through extensive use and years of wear they eventually lost some functionality. I have since tries Beats, Denon, Sony, Marley, and have QC Bose over the ear. I my opinion Shure has the best sound quality and construction. I am not has hyped up has most people are with Bose and thought in ear/active noise cancellation and sound from the Denon set was better but Shure is my favorite by far"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound at a reasonable price. When I first turned them on I had the audio cutting in and out. Reconnected the cable to the ear pieces and that fixed it. I am very impressed the soundstage of these IEM's.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After only three months, the right headphone only works when the connection between the cord and headphone is in a few specific spots. After paying around $100 last year, I expected these headphones to last me around a year before breaking. I'm not sure if I buying a new cord would fix this problem. There is nothing visually wrong with the cord, headphone, or connection."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did some research before buying the Shure SE215, reading reviews of various earbud products on Amazon and on blog sites devoted to reviewing products like these. Although I had heard of Shure products before (microphones, specifically), I had not heard of Shure earbuds prior to my research. Based upon that research, I bought the SE215.

This is a great product. I am not an 'audio-phile' but the sound is spectacular, perhaps even as good as my Bose Q15 ANR headphones. Some reviews spoke about difficulty bending them around the ears. Either these folks were paid by another company to write something bad or they are just too inept to use any product - please keep knives away from these folks! I had them out of the box and in my ears within minutes and I have never had a problem with them.

Other folks claimed, likely also disingenuously, that they would not stay in their ears. Before the Shure SE215, I never had earbuds that stayed in my ears. They all fell out, including the Bose earbuds. (Nothing against Bose, they make great products, but their earbuds did not stay in my ears.) The Shure SE215's stick like glue. They have never fallen out. In fact, they fit so securely, that when walking, the vibrations from ones feet can be heard. Some might consider this a problem, but it will be the same with every set of earbuds that fit securely.

Great product - I highly recommend them."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent IEMs for the price, I don't have a large amount of experience with other in ear monitors but the sound through these is crisp and clear. The bass reproduction is pretty good, it's not too heavy at a neutral level without any enhancements but they can give a nice big clean amount of low end if you increase the low frequencies. One complaint I have is that the foam sleeves that come with the monitors are very difficult to remove, luckily they fit me fairly well so I haven't bothered with them too much. Also, I would recommend getting the black ones, it's very difficult to see the left and right letters on the clear ones which I bought. Overall though, a great product from Shure!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my Shure SE-110 earbuds. They were fantastic, but years of hard use had finally taken them to the breaking point. The SE215s arrived in the retail packaging, though it was a bit scuffed up. The package contains the earbuds, carrying case, 4 or 5 sets of different sized foam and rubber ear pads, and a cleaning tool.

The first thing I noticed about these is that they addressed all the flaws of my previous set. The cable on my old pair frayed and broke where they curved over your ears. They have added a reinforced rubber sleeve at that location to prevent it. On the old pair, if they cable broke anywhere, your headphones were trashed. The SE215's now have a disconnect at the earbud so that if the cable breaks you don't have to trash the drivers.

Sound quality is great, if you're coming from cheap earbuds to these, you'll hear things in your music that you didn't even know were there before. I look forward to many good years of use out of these."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these. Really solid seal for isolation - you won't hear anything around you. I use them when flying and usually can't hear anything around me including the overhead announcements. My only complaint would be that the foam pieces are extremely difficult to get off. I haven't been able to remove mine to try a different size ... everything attempt I've had, I have felt like I was going to break them. Other than that, very good sound quality and overall great product."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved these ear buds.
The cord is really long but you get used to it. Very solid build.
I love that I can replace the ear bud part of the headset that usually fails first. I love to foam ear pieces.
I've read that the replacement cable is sub-par/in mic option which is a little scary as I might need to replace that part soon.
Beats (gaga/diddy/lebrons) I've tried them all and they all failed in a years time. Finally gave up on them.The Shures SO MUCH BETTER. The sound quality is incomparable. Crisp high notes and the bass isn't lost either. No excess sound gets in."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding. Only issue is that when singing open jaw for big moments my ear canal closes up and dulls or slightly mutes them, maybe it's just my anatomy. Not sure..."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After couple of etymotic and klipsch and many more i bought these as a second headphone. Oh my god these are super headphones far better than etymotics hf2s and klipsch s4s. The first minute you will hear the difference mid and lows, the isolation. Nice package, cheap looking case. What did i do? I gave these to my brother order 535 right away. To be honest the 535 did not make the same impact as 215s. I will wait. But at 80-90 dollar range you will get best sound, high build quality, tank like durability. Klipsch s4s feels like a joke compare to shure 215 and they are close in the price range. Go and buy them, you won't regret it."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying to find replacement after replacement for earbuds that just stop working after a year, I decided to buy one with removable cables. The Shure SE215-CL are probably the greatest earbuds I've ever used. Not just in sound quality, but in build quality and sound isolation. I can now ride the NYC subway while playing music at 50% volume without having to worry about surrounding noise. EASILY the best headphone purchase ever."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super great sound quality, super comfortable to wear; super great ability to separate the headphone from the original chord and reconnect it to a different one if your cat decides she needs a midnight snack. I'm not a hugely careful person and used to break or overuse earbuds into dysfunction within a year- not these guys! They'll take a couple smashes and smacks (though, don't do this intentionally!) before they give up. Definitely worth the cost if audio and durability are high priorities."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound was just ok in these earbuds but the comfort and ease of putting them in my ear was lacking. Positioning the wire to go behind the ear was annoying, but once it's there it stays. I take my headphones in and out frequently, making this style really inconvenient. The foam inserts are really difficult to swap out for the other inserts. Sound isolation was excellent though, just too bad it did not work out."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones themselves are the tried and true se-215's but the BT adapter is mediocre. Don't quite expect mediocre product from Shure. Problem is that signal cuts out occasionally.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great but I am having a hard time getting them in my ears correctly. I wear glasses and have to be careful in taking them off. I caught my glasses arm and broke it off. I wish they would just go straight into my ear and not have to wrap around behind and on top.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, just as I was about to give up on earphones or earbuds and stick with headphones, I decided to give these a try. I've always hated earphones/earbuds because they never seem to fit my ears right. When I saw these, it sounded like the foam used in the construction of the earbud made a much more formed fit. More like foam ear plugs for hearing protection.

I attend loud concerts regularly, play drums, and shoot guns too), so I'm pretty familiar with hearing protection. Now that I've found these Shure earbuds, I will never go back to another line of earphones/headphones. These little isolating earphones are just what I needed. I can use them not only for listening to my iPod, but I can even use them for sound monitoring with the drums.

The package comes with a nice array of accessories. Plenty of sizes of ear pieces, and a nice quality little soft pouch. Fitting them in and wrapping the cord over your ear is something I'll have to get used to. It took me a few minutes to figure it out, but then it fit great. The sound is good. A little bass-heavy, but I'd rather have too much bass than not enough (can always use the EQ bass reducer on the iPod). I think my Bose headphones are still better for hi-fi at home. With these Shure earphones, I ordered the white/clear/silver color rather than the black. In hindsight, I should have ordered the black. I thought the clear would blend-in with my clothing and skin and therefore look less noticeable. But because of the translucent cable and the fact that it's both silver and copper wire underneath, it actually draws more attention. Almost looks like jewelry. Face it: Because of the design of these, people are either going to think you're hard of hearing and wearing a hearing aid, or you're a rock star and wired for the big stadium show.

A couple of words of caution: As another review said, these little babies seriously do isolate you. Now, maybe on a subway that's a good thing. You can get lost in your little world listening to music or an audio book on a commute. Or maybe in your dorm room studying or meditating with some nice ambient music on. But honestly these earphones would be absolutely dangerous to use while jogging or riding a bike. You'll hear nothing but the music. No care horns. No police chase. No rabid dogs chasing you. Sorry if I'm stating the obvious, but these earphones really are like wearing deafening hearing protection. Another related issue: If you're listening to soft or quiet music and you're moving around, you'll hear every foot step you take, every burp, every breath, every Dorito you eat, and all the jostling of your body. That's just the nature of the beast when you plug your ears totally up. Last thing to mention: Make sure to set the max volume limit on your iPod before you plug these earphones in. If you're not careful, you'll blast your eardrums more with these plugs than with over-the-ear vented headphones.

Solid recommendation on these earphones. Just be careful where/how you wear them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a nice set of earphones. They perform as I expected. The quility seems to be a step up from my last pair of Shure E2-Cs. The part of the cord that wraps around the ear is now reinforced which makes me think it will last longer. The sound isolation is very good. The inserts are made of coated memory foam. They sound great too.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Living in New York can get very loud, especially if your near the train, i bought these because i never give earbuds a chance in my life. So these seem good for my price range. And wow are they a huge step compared to the muddy as hell Skullcandy Supreme Earbuds. I have to say, the price is worth it, and the case it has comes in handy as if i need to put them away, ill be safe about using these headphones and put them in the case."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had purchased the Shure SE530 some years ago. The cabling finally wore out and they were done. They were quite wonderful and short of putting to hi-fi speakers to my ears, nothing compared. I thought about a reshell, but decided to try these. The sound quality of these SE215's is nearly equal. It was a little tricky learning how to wear them (several times until I grasped the concept), but no issues now. I primarily use them for workouts, walks, etc. I also have a pair of Klipsch S4-II, which does not have quite the sound quality, but are a good second."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 500's but destroyed them on a bike ride, cord got tangled in my wheel & ripped the cord. Well that shouldn't happen with these.... sound's not bad, fit is solid Shure. Best isolation there is, decent bass, clear mids.... I tired the cable with the mic, but didn't see the advantage of $50 just to have a mic. I just speak into the phone.... the only thing is they are expensive for what they are.... headphones....."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my $50 Ultimate Ears broke within 2 months, I bought these on impulse. The wire on my prior earbuds pretty much tore and the left ear stopped working. Once I read in one of the reviews that these Shure earbuds have a very sturdy wire, I was pretty much sold because I was so mad about my old ones breaking. When I first receives these in the mail, I was quite confused. How do you put them in your ear? I had to read the little manual sheet to realize that the wire goes over and behind your ear, not like most earbuds. I admit, at first, these were a bit awkward to wear, but after a while, you get the hang of it and they slip on your ear perfectly. I love dubstep, so I listen to music with a lot of bass, and these earbuds perform. The wire is also very sturdy, just as the review stated; wire is very strong and won't rip. I definitely recommend these earbuds, they are well worth the three digits."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"One headphone died from faulty wiring after a few months. I purchased these in the vain hope that top of the line headphones would have made their headphone copper wires more than a few micrometers thick, but despite the much thicker wires (which are probably just additional plastic), one earbud has died after 6 months of light use. For $100 consumers should expect better.

The sound quality is good but is not distinguishably better than the Sennheiser CX 300 II, which are a third of the price, last the same time, and are perhaps easier to use (not as bulky in your pocket, no silly around the ear system). For lack of a better option I'd recommend the Sennheisers instead."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise canceling and isolation work so well, I can't hear people talking a few feet away from me. Sound quality is great, with audible bass but not too much. 6 different ear inserts mean it should fit just about anyone, but the standard size has worked for everyone I know. The cable is long, very durable and replaceable. It takes a little getting used to because the cables go forward, then up and over your ears, unlike most earbuds that just dangle."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"clean and neutral sound. Great isolation of noise. If you want a good hifi sound, this is a good choice."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound good, but don't expect them to last more than 2-3 years. I've had different versions of this level Shure earbud for about ten years now, and all have failed within 3 years. Usually it's the cord. Now the cord is replaceable, so it's less of an expense... but why not just make a product that lasts?

It's a shame, because they sound good."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are amazing..love the deep bass and the clear sound. I travel frequently for work and once these are in I hear nothing but my music and movies. They are a bit awkward at first but once you ""figure"" out how to wear them you will love them."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to use as in ear monitors for live playing. (I am a drummer). The sound is good, if you can get the proper fit- I have to use foam inserts and insert them completely in my ears to get adequate bass reproduction.

One major annoyance that I quickly discovered was that if you move around a lot, the rotating connection makes an audible grinding sound when then earphones are fully inserted. This is not a sound emanating from the earphones; it is a physical sensation caused by the rotating connection mechanism that is audible ( when inserted) especially when no sound is being emitted from a sound source. Very annoying. I ordered these as replacements for some E-3's that I used back in 2005 - The E-3's fit way better, and didn't have the annoying grinding sound.

Aside from that, they do sound good- be sure to keep around plenty of fresh foam inserts; If they do not fit snugly in your ears, there is very poor bass response. Conversely, if the fit IS snug, the bass response is fantastic."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading that these Eapbuds are used by a lot of musicians, I figured that they would be a good investment for $99. Was I ever wrong. When I was able to get around to using these, the right loop that goes up and over the ear has a BAD connection. If usually does not work, but when I do get it in just the right position, it goes out in a few seconds. On top of that, when I do get it working temporarily, my Bass Guitar makes this thing rattle terribly, I tried all kinds of different gain settings on my Tech21 and Alesis NanoCompressor, but I have to have the gain/volume WAY down to keep them from rattling. I then tried a pair of Skull Candy earphones and a $45 set of Audio Technica active earbuds. Neither had this problem. On the Audio Technica earbuds, the volume is probably 2-4 times louder without any rattling like in the Sure SE215-K. These things are terrible. The bad thing is that I wasn't able to try them until after my return time had run out with Amazon. I need to buy another set of the Audio Technica for backup. I like them better than my Bose Active Noise Cancelling in that when the battery goes out in the Bose, there is no sound. With the Audio Technica, I still have sound, just no noise cancelling. I am really disappointed with the Sure. I wonder if I just got a bad pair."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for an active lifestyle. Ear buds stay in place really well. Pretty decent sound isolation - used them on several military aircraft instead of ear plugs.

The only downside is the really long cord, so not any real problems with it. I looked for a shorter cord since the ear pieces snap on for easy replacement. Still haven't found one, so I end up stuffing the etra cord in my pocket.

This is my 3rd pair of Shure in the last 10 yrs and I'd guess this pair will go quite a distance."

It was like I was taken away to a island where I was being treated with a personal concert.

.. all dramatics aside, this is one of the best IEM's I've bought in the seven years I've been sound engineering. Definite plus on the construction, especially the mold-able ear loop stress reliefs."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these October 8, 2014. I used to use these for college daily, but now I have been using them daily at night to listen to YouTube videos, then white noise throughout the night to help me sleep. They aren't the most comfortable out there, but they get the job done and I'm able to sleep with them without major discomfort. Soundwise they are good, with the sound leaning a little bit metallic top end, but remember all ears hear differently. I haven't had it short whatsoever and they're as good as new! Hopefully they will last me another 3 years or more."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very comfortable and have great sound for the price. They do cut out a lot of sound as well. I use these when playing drums as part hearing protection and part in ear monitor. Can't be beat for the price.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this wireless connection and would have given it a 5 star rating yesterday. Distance, battery life, ease of use, and sound quality were all great. I used it primarily at the gym matched up with a pair of 425s. Came home from the gym yesterday and went to charge it but the light wouldn’t come on so I took it to another charger in the house where it lit up and seemed to be charging just fine. Went to unplug it this morning and I was shocked when the connector burned my fingers. It was very hot to touch. I had a bad feeling. Sure enough, it no longer turns on. The buttons won’t even depress. I’m gessing the internals melted or swelled. I will include some pictures that show the casing is now warped from the heat. It might be hard to see without a before and after picture but trust me, it’s warped. All this of course happened 10 days after my return window with Amazon closed. I will attempt to work with the Shure warranty department. Will update with progress."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as an affordable option for in-ear monitors to use on Sundays when I lead worship on stage with my band. I am quite impressed with the sound quality, the noise isolation and the discrete look of these earphones. I've seen other brands at 5 times the price I paid for these and while I'm sure they are worth the extra money, I just can't justify spending that amount with the budget I have to work with. I am very pleased with the case they came with in addition to the varying sizes of ear molds to custom fit them to the consumer. The dynamic range is more than adequate to be able to hear clearly both the high and low frequencies of the various instruments of our band."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great. Sturdy. Comfortable. Good case. Only downside is that putting them on is relatively much more complicated than any other pair of headphones I've owned. You have to wrap them over your ear. Once they're on, they won't fall off. But I do get pretty frustrated sometimes."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an audiophile and I should say that this earpiece met my expectations as far as sound. I will keep this short and give the pro's and con's

Pro's:

- Very good balanced sound. I compared it to my Klipsch S4i II which has a very good review by cnet as well as other sites. I must say that the sound quality of SE 215 surpassed it when it came to clarity and the well roundedness of the sound. One of the best when it comes to sound quality in this price range.

- One of the sturdiest earphones that you will find. It's built like a tank compared to most others in this price range.

- The detachable wires are great. You can replace them without shelling out the bucks for a new one.

- Excellent noise cancellation.

Cons:

- The only issue I had with this, which is not really a bad problem, was the seal on my ear was too tight. While I enjoyed the noise cancellation I couldn't use it for long durations. Considering the fact that it was built mainly for stage performance, it makes sense that the seal is superb and its not streamlined for hours and hours of music.

- The chord length can sometime bother people because its built really well and its regid.

So!! All in all a 5 star product when it comes to build and sound quality and for the right kind of usage."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for months now and am just getting around to this review. So I have a lot of listening and use on these. I use them mostly for air travel. I originally purchased these because of the high noise isolation ratings. They really do have very good isolation properties, the audio quality is also exceptional for the price as well. This is important to me as I have been designing loudspeakers professionally for around 30 years. For the price I highly recommend these."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful set of headphones! I am using them with an IBasso DX50 player and have been nothing but pleased with both the sound quality and fit. Everything from Anthrax to Aaaron Copland sound wonderful. The fit is superb! I will say that changing the supplied earplugs was quite a pain but there are some helpful videos online for some tips. It is only a very minor quibble though. For someone like myself who is just starting to get into Hi-Def sound these are a wonderful starting point! I will surely be upgrading to the SE535 or maybe even the SE846 when I get the chance.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, you cannot ask for anything better. I have an older version of these headphones (SE110) and the clarity you get with these newer drivers is much better. Some may not like the over-the-ear design. This is a personal preference but once inserted, they stay in place without any discomfort. Plus, the passive noise reduction is great for the traveler who flies long distance. I am able to save my hearing but using these during the flight to reduce the cabin noise."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my delightful and hardworking Shure SE315s finally decided to break after 6 years of pretty much daily use (replaced the cord 2 times), I needed to find a replacement earbuds. After reading a lot of reviews and contemplating, I realized I was not over my 315s. Once you've experienced amazing sound on a daily basis, going back to cheap earbuds is almost ""painful"". However, the 315s were a little too pricey for me to replace at the moment, so I decided to go with the 215s. Checked a couple of other reviews and it seemed like there wasn't too much of a difference.

Surprisingly the SE215s are a little more bass-y than my old 315s. The sound (to me) sounds pretty similar. Same high quality, heavy duty cord from shure, and as someone who used to go through many, many cheap <$10 earbuds, heavy duty cords are a godsend! The foam tips beautifully mold to my ears and it doesn't feel like anything at all. I love how they include many different sized tips (foam and rubber ones).

I don't have too much to say that already hasn't before, but if you're trying to decide between SE315 and SE215, the 215s are a great choice, not only because it's about $100 cheaper, but to a lay person who's not an expert audiophile, these are great!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure where to start...
Well I was excited about finally having an option to wirelessly connect my 846s and found that this shure product would be amazing. Problem is.... I got something that I’m pretty sure isn’t a shure product. The box is legit, packing is legit but the actual product is completely fake and trash. Not to keep on ranting but see attached photos so you know what I’m talking about.... I would be weary of it. The cables are garbage too, the piece that attaches to my earpieces fell off both ends within an hour of using. Didn’t realize it was a fake until after I just so happened to look at the box and noticed the cable I got is not legit, no logos, no nothing cheap plastic and poorly made. I’m going to contact shure directly to see..."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm moving up from a pair of Audio Technica earphones that are half the price. They were great earbuds, but they were horribly uncomfortable for my tiny ear canals. I decided to splurge on these and I'm happy I did. The sound quality was fantastic and I didn't even have to break them in. They are not as comfortable as I'd like, but the pain in my ears doesn't linger as long as it does when I wear the AT's.

Another reviewer mentioned that a con of these is the sound isolation. I would have to agree. They block a LOT of sound out. It's great for planes. I was on a flight with a poor baby that cried for over an hour. With these on and listening to music at a low volume, I couldn't hear the baby at all. However, I can't wear these around my apartment. I think someone would scare the earwax out of me because I wouldn't hear them coming."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered and tried several in ear phones based on ""best"" lists of professional online reviewers and Amazon reviews, trying to find the one that sounded best to me and had at least acceptable comfort. I ended up keeping these Shures along with the Beyerdynamic MMX 101 iE. The reason I kept the Shures is because of their warm, balanced sound. I can play these loud without any hint of harshness or listening fatigue. Played loud they sound quite punchy and have solid bass output. The midrange (vocals) is very smooth and accurate. Treble is very good, but could use a bit more extension. This is hard to do without adding harshness. I will always prefer a slightly rolled off treble over harshness. These are a bit of a pain to put into your ears, but once in, they are quite comfortable and provide a tight seal with excellent isolation from outside noise. The build quality is second to none in this price range. By comparison, the Beyerdynamics I mentioned earlier have more bass output, more accurate bass, not quite as good midrange, and similar treble. The Beyerdynamics also have a wider soundstage than the Shures, but much lower build quality."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I go through earphones like most people go through tissues. Not that I'm careless, exactly, but I'm very active and have lost many an earphone to slammed doors and missing eartips and water damage. The first thing I noticed after unboxing was the large L-jack connector. I was worried it wouldn't fit with my case (a Griffin Survivor) but it fit just fine. The second thing I noticed was the strain release on this jack which really should be standard but sadly is not. Anyone who's had exposed wires where the jack meets the cord after one too many yanks knows why a good strain release is important. The cable is thick but not overly so. I would review the different tips but I've yet to be able to get the originals off. To me this is a pro as I lose ear tips way too easily, but to some it may be a con. I'm lucky in that the default tips fit my ears well. According to Shure, you can freeze them for 10 minutes or so and the tips should screw right off. Haven't tried it yet 'cause I like the defaults.

Sound quality is excellent and clear, though I am nowhere close to an audiophile. Live songs can sound like you're in the theatre though, which is great. The cord is super long too, which is not annoying as I'd first worried. From end to end mine are about 5' long.

True to my nature, I've dropped these a few times, closed a door on them, and been running out in the rain with them, and they haven't suffered at all. I've had them about two months. Now I don't even hesitate to put these in my ears, which did take some getting used to with the weird wraparound design. But that design does lead to a secure fit.

I love these earbuds and can see them lasting a long time, so if you're looking for active wear, I'd say these are worth your investment."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"...and these earbuds/phones are still working as well as they did on day one! I am only writing a review now because I am 1.) Lazy and 2.) Been victim of having to go back and adjust my comments because my initial review was a bit hasty.

Some of you may be thinking these are expensive (even for being on their lower end of products), but think about all those times you settled and purchased the less expensive solution only to be disappointed. For me, it's been 5 years and counting... even if they broke today - a cost of $19.00 per year is just unheard of these days... I'd buy another set (I own two now) because you just can't beat the ROI.

It was the performance of these earbuds that have lead to a recent purchase of a Condensor Mic from Shure. I'll be back in another 5 years to let you know how those work!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for 5+ years and there hasn't been a day I haven't used them.
The sound quality isn't the clearest hifi you will find, mostly because of the single driver, however they have a natural response throughout the spectrum but just a little flat on the highs. They have absolutely no hype which makes them neutral, a little ""boring"" if you will but ideal for my use case.
I'm a drummer, been giving these a rough treatment for 5+ years and both the cable and the drivers just don't want to break, I'm amazed.
In order to get a good sound make sure you chose the right tip so that they fit snugly in your ears.
They cost $100, I've tried Shure's top of the line in-ear monitors that cost several thousands, I don't see why someone would buy those.
The cable is easy to spool around the palm, somewhere around a 2 inch diameter, which fits just right in the pouch, I wouldn't recommend bending them any more than that.
After many years the part of the cable that's the ear hangers have developed a greenish color, probably because of oxidization, sound quality remains great.
Just like the 57 or 58, Shure have hit the sweet spot in price and quality with these, if you only have this amount of money so spend I think this is a solid choice."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Would have given these 5 stars because the sound quality and noise isolation is unbelievable for a pair of IEM's. My first issue with these earphones is that the part of the earpiece that the foam tips attach to is plastic whereas I would love a more durable construction to make sure it doesn't brake if I'm having to struggle to change ear tips. Secondly, my right headphone had a slight ""clicking"" noise whenever I turn my head too far left, it's not horrible, but you can notice it and it can be a little annoying if you're walking with them in. However, I do only use these for studying in the library and they are EXCELLENT for cancelling out any background noise and allowing me to listen to my music at any volume I would like. Would love it if Shure updated these with a sturdier construction, but they are definitely worth their price nonetheless."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound for the price! This could be said for many budget reference audio solutions, but what makes these stand out is their incredible soundstage. Nothing- and I mean nothing- that I've heard under $500 (and I've heard a lot) comes even close to what this $99 pair of buds provides (except for maybe it's siblings in the SE series.) I use them for music and studio applications, and they are more than suitable for both, with only slight EQ tweaks needed to suit my personal preference. Fit is great, but give the cord some time to bend to shape! Tips fit well into my ear canal, which I would consider medium sized in relation to others. These buds are also easy to drive with any source audio. It's also important to note that unlike some competing models, these are TRULY isolating. They are also built like tanks - I experienced both of these traits when I used them while skiing in sub-zero conditions this winter. The world around me was completely blocked out - so much so that when I was going on more crowded routes I was inclined to use just one bud so that I could be warned of fellow skiiers! These things are NO JOKE for their price, and receive my instant recommendation when anyone I know is looking for incredible audio at an incredible price."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in 2012 and still happily using them in 2016. I listen to a wide range of music, but primarily use these headphones only while traveling, on planes primarily.

The sound quality is good, the noise reduction quality is quite good, and the fit is fairly good. Easy to travel with and easy to get on and off.

I don't do professional music production so I'm not sure exactly how great the sound / frequency range reproduction is, and I am not really interested in heavy bass directly into my ear canal, but I believe the quality is great for my listening needs.

They are comfortable but due to the semi-tight fit, I don't recommend using them for multiple hours on end. Although I have - I've listened to music for hours straight on longer flights, and must say that after an hour or two the fit can get uncomfortable, but bearable. I don't recommend sleeping with these on, at least for more than an hour or two - I switch to molded earplugs if I'm on a redeye or longer flight. I don't think it's possible for in-ear headphones to maintain comfort for a very long time, so I'm very happy with these regardless of these comments.

Overall, no real complaints and I love music, and these help me enjoy it on the road."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but the cable started going out on the left side after only 3 months. I honestly expected more from this brand at this price point. Wish it came with a shorter cable, too. Can't use these headphones while running or working out due to the cable length and lack of durability."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,After some research on different in the ear monitors I decided to give Shure a try again. I had a pair of e2c headphones in the early 2000's and I loved them. When I heard that Shure had finally released a Bluetooth connected headphone I had to give them a try. These headphones are pretty good when it comes to sound isolation. Sound quality is right where is should be for the price. Looking forward to a codec update (according to Shure there will be no codec update for these).
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am traveling around the country a lot. I use these for music or when I am watching a movie on my tablet. The sound is excellent. The base is very nice without being overpowering. I used to use the very popular over the ear noise cancelling head phones, but set them on the shelf years ago. These are easy to carry. I don't need an extra carrying case to bring on a plane. They fit fine in my pocket or laptop bag. I don't feel like I am loosing anything on sound."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these Shure BTs for 2 days and used them extensively with my Shure SE 846s. They sound terrific and make the 846s much more useful. Now I can easily use them while working out. Not sure whether I will ever go back to the standard cable.

After 2 weeks of regular use, they are even better than I thought they were after 2 days. Terrific sound — easy to pair."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolating qualities are exactly what is advertised. DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE IN!!!! You wont hear anything.

Base response is warm and natural sounding but not strong enough to wash out low mids.

Mids are a little muddy in my opinion but i think it is because the treble response is soft.

Overall I use these for IEM's and they are a great tool to keep track of what I'm doing on stage.

And they dont stick out like ultimate ears. They sit in your ear canal and partially fill the cavity that surround the opening to your ear canal before looping over and behind your earlobe."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with these headphones. I use them as in-ear monitors with a church band, for regular listening, and as headphones when working out.
Positives:
Great, well-balanced sound.
Lots of earpieces, so its easy to find a good fit.
Removable cord (the spot where my headphones usually break)
Negatives:
If you've never used behind the head headphones, they can be a bit uncomfortable at first.
They REALLY block out sound. Could be a positive if you're into that sort of thing, but I can't wear them at work because they make me seem unresponsive to coworkers (in reality, I just can't hear them with these in).

Overall, these are a great value and I highly recommend them."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sure SE215 are REALLY good! Highs are clear without being sharp, mids are there and the bass is a little boosted which I like! These are really good for traveling and they are really comfortable! However the clear version will discolor after a while! Watch out! I would recommend the black version."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Last month i lost another pair of Shure in-ear headphones (a different model that is now discontinued) and I was mad. I loved those for their sound, construction quality and the carrying case they come with. I really wanted to get the exact same ones again but they are now discontinued, so somehow i convinced myself to try some Harman Kardon AE's. BIG MISTAKE! Sound was average but they were the most uncomfortable things to wear and their carrying case was terrible. So, i sent them back and got these Shure SE215's.
These things are a STEAL for the price. They sound awesome, they are VERY comfortable to wear and they even look cool. They are the same style as rockstars wear during their concerts.
I wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere. Get these and stop reading reviews.
Happy Shopping!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent IEM's (In-ear-monitors) for the price. I use them both for live performances (I'm a guitarist/vocalist) and for listening to music from my phone or laptop. As long as you have a good sound guy to mix your monitor feed, these will sound excellent. Vocals sound great through them, as well as lower frequency stuff like drums or bass. Also, they're great at noise cancelling, so you only hear what you want to hear.

After using these everyday for almost two years, the cable started to exhibit some wear and tare and i had to replace them (only $30, so not bad). But really, that's a testament to how well-made they are, as every other pair of earbuds/earphones i've used have broken down much faster with less use."

They also do a GREAT job of blocking background chatter of colleagues in open-plan offices ;)"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As long well known, Shure is the best all-around professional audio company that is also value added. The SE215 model stands up to this, and even at $99 (MSRP), you get a powerful punch. With single drivers, the lows and mids are obviously not what you'd hear with upper Shure models, but Shure did a great job at averaging out what you'd need for this level of ears. I find myself finding more and more uses for this set."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to audio quality, I have a very specific taste. I like booming bass, but not over-exagerated and fake - real bass. I like CLEAR vocals, and being able to distinguish all the different instruments and layers in music. Previously, I bought a pair of Klipsch Image X10's, and I thought they were amazing. However, they were a little fuzzy and sort of unclear. Deffinitely not worth the $350 I shelled out considering they broke in about 6 months after normal daily use. The connecter to the device completely broke, and made them worthless. Klipsch may have good sound quality, but they REALLY need to put a little more effort into the build quality. I did some research after those broke, and came across these. I was skeptical of the round ear tips because I have VERY small ear canals, and only Klipsch's pattented oval ear tips fit my ears. Of course, I was right to worry because when I tried the ear tips that came with these, I was scared I had just wasted more money. However, I thought, why not take two great brands and combine them? I took my old Klipsch ear tips and sure enough they fit like a glove on my new Shure SE215's!! And thus, the BEST HEADPHONES ON THE PLANET are born. The sound quality on these bad boys is just OUTSTANDING. It fit all my requirements and even more. PERFECT amount of bass, clear vocals, and no part of the music is left unheard. I was just simply blow away by the sound quality. (I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50's, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to sound quality. What makes these headphones even better is the tank-like build quality. I feel like these could be runover countless times by cars and never break. I would suggest getting the clear instead of the black - they look SICK - the cable looks silver and it will never get dirty unlike ordinary white headphones - you can see all the components and drivers through the clear housing and it's just a really cool design. These headphones are a STEAL for $100. What else can I say? Shure, you've done it again."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a few years, I had been using my old Sony EX71's (which still sound great). I've wanted to upgrade for a while and have tried various earphones along the way, but none have impressed me. After some online research, I decided to order four pairs of earbuds - the Ultimate Ears UE600 and UE500, Klipsch S4 and the SE215's, with the hope of finding at least one pair that's a keeper. I was looking at the under-$100 price point.

The UE500's sounded okay, though the bass was a bit boomy and the highs could be cleaner. They also seem cheaply made and I wouldn't expect them to last. The UE600's are excellent and I may keep them. The balanced armature driver provides amazingly detailed vocals and instrumentals. They don't provide very deep, extended bass, however they do seem to handle lows accurately and are fine for everything but bass-heavy genres like hip hop. After hearing the S4's, I'm surprised that they have such a large following. They sounded very average, with exaggerated, boomy bass and rather harsh (sibilant) highs. Just shows you what one good CNET review and effective marketing can do. For the current price of $59, however, they're worth it if you need some loud earbuds with good sound isolation to use in noisy environments.

The last pair I tried were SE215's. To be honest, I wasn't too excited about these, as I expected them to be uncomfortable, with the over-the-ear style and relatively bulky design. But that all changed as soon as I heard them. These are the nicest sounding earbuds I've heard by far. Smooth, balanced, warm, distortion-free sound from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. And the bass is not only deep, but tight and controlled. I can see the sound of the UE600's or S4's being fatiguing after an hour or so, but the 215's sound so sweet I think I could listen to them all day. While no audiophile, I think I'm pretty picky and I honestly can't come up with any criticism as far as the sound. Shure has been around since the 1920's and has a good reputation, which gives me confidence in the design and engineering that goes into their products. Many of today's trendy brands probably just outsource design and manufacturing overseas and are more about appearance and bling factor, rather than sound quality. I've always had this image of Shure appealing to purists who prefer a totally flat frequency response and who listen mainly to classical music. The SE215 is the first model that has more of a v-shaped curve, with some bass enhancement. The amount of bass is just right - somewhere between flat and extended, as with bass-heavy earbuds. The result is a rich, full sound that is great with all genres of music and which most regular, non-audiophile users will probably prefer.

The quality is top notch. There are substantial strain relief moldings at all cord junctions. The cord and plug seem quite rugged and furthermore, the cord is replaceable. The 215's have a 2-year warranty, which is great for earbuds. Six sets of tips are included (3 silicone and 3 foam). I went with the silicone tips, since I'm too lazy to mess with the compressable tips each time.

Putting them on is fairly quick and easy once you get used to it (though slightly less convenient than under ear buds). They're also very comfortable, once you know how to position them properly. If you wear glasses, there might be some discomfort after a while due to having both the wire sleeve and the arm of the glasses resting on your ears. There are some photos online of people wearing the SE215's incorrectly (left and right sides reversed). Obviously, using them correctly makes a huge difference in comfort and bass response. The over the ear style helps keep the cord out of the way, where they're less likely to snag on something. The sound isolation is very effective, which means they shouldn't be used anywhere you need to be able to hear. If you're considering these but are hesitating, give them a try. I'm glad I did."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased several ~$100 earphones over the years and these are by far my favorite. They are comfortable, the cable is durable, they keep out external noise, and they sound very good. The only weakness I would say is the highs aren't as strong as the mid or lower ranges, but that makes them a bit easier to listen to for extended periods. I also have been using these for about a year with no issues and usually in that time I get tempted to buy other earphones, but I just can't imagine finding anything better. The next pair of earphones I buy will be higher end Shures."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going to give 5 stars, but after riding for awhile with these, I noticed that my ears were getting more and more sore. The fitting molds are great, and they do fit relatively well (not like customs, but hey, these aren't custom), but because they are hard plastic, they wear on my cartilage in my ears. If you have pimple in your ear (gasp!), they are unwearable.

I do love the sound and the loudness, and the cable length is good, too."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a replacement for some my wife had that died after a few years of using while running. This new pair is solid and sound terrific. I have used Klipsch, Bose, and these Shure, and these are some of the best sounds headphones I had used. Deep bass, and tight fit...once you get them in just right, which can be a challenge at times, but once you get used to putting them in, and bend the wire just right, they go right in."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair of headsets are quite good. great sound, good cord and nice size. The issue I have is with me. My right ear canal does not go in at the correct angle so my right ear doesn't get sealed like my left. This causes the sound to not be as good as it can be. The soft buds completely seal the ear which is nice but when you are eating you notice pressure build up in the ears and I find myself touching the ear-buds a lot when that happens.

Overall, great sound size and customization possibilities with the provided buds."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just opened them, and they've managed to make a great replacement for some old E2Cs (which I love but really don't fit my tiny ears properly, they fall out even with the smallest sleeves), more recently followed by 2 broken pairs (Ultimate Ears and Klipsch). I won't stray from Shure again, sound quality is top notch and all the areas where my previous 2 pairs have broken (wire broke away at the jack connector) are reinforced and seemingly durable. Did I mention the sound quality is top notch? I can't wait to drown out the NYC subway sounds during my commute with crystal-clear and deep sound."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a set of earbuds that sound good but also have good noise isolation to use while mowing the yard or watching a movie on a flight.
These earbuds sound great, sound is well balanced, good bass but not to boomy. While they are not noise canceling, they provide enough isolation to listen to music or movies comfortably without having to crank the volume. I would recommend."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read some online reviews about these headphones and I decided to take a chance. So I added them to my Christmas Wish List and my wife got them for me. All I can say is WOW!!!!. There is a learning curve on how to get them to properly fit in your ear, but once you get ""it"" and are able to feel the proper fit, it's very easy. They are very comfortable and the sound is INCREDIBLE. I had a pair of Denon, which I loved, but the wire sheath where they attached to the earphone kept pulling apart. And while they still work today, I was always concerned that one false move and a wire would get broken. My next pair was a pair of SkullCandy Titan. At first I liked them, but very quickly they became uncomfortable to wear for long periods. But with the Shure SE215-K are simply the best I have owned. The sound is clear and defined, and are very efficient. They are not too bassy, but not to tinny either. They are very balanced and sharp and defined. I would highly recommend these if you are in the market for a new pair of headphones."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphones are fine. After having used it for 2 months, the quality has deteriorated. Now, I know that these are headphones used for on-stage hidden comms and music but that doesnt provide an excuse for it's incredibly feeble design. The strengthened cord that wraps around the back of your ear on my right ear broke from countless times that I had to fix it just because it keeps on loosening. I do NOT recommend this product."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at comparable earphones from Klipsch, Etymotics and Shure, I decided to settle on Shure's SE-215. The SE-215 delivers in sound quality. Highs are crisp, mids are clear and lows produce some great bass (pending you have the proper cushions in place). Compared to the Klipsch S4, the SE-215 has richer mid's and the bass was more tonal compared to the slightly ""boomy"" klipsch drivers. All in all the sound quality was above my expectations for a pair or earphones costing approximately $100.

My only gripe about the set was the cable. It's very long but more than that, the 2 inches closest to the earbuds are made up of this thicker material that is god-awfully frustrating. Bending it to the contours around your ear is tough, especially when moving and it's prone to come loose during rigorous activity (Marathon Running / Rock Climbing). Thank god you can replace the cable but it should have came with something a bit more manageable."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,They feel great and the volume is good. But missing a jump ahead or back button. Also the bass is way to much and no way to turn it down.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do professional sound engineering so have a bit of a bias towards liking anything Shure says. That said... I am quite happy with these.

I used to use much cheaper ear buds under my helmet, then those $80 Etymotic Research ER7-MC3-BLUE-I-A MC3 units (with the built-in iPhone control & mic, to enable easier phone calls with the helmet on). BUT, those stuck out too far, even when fully inserted, and sometimes just a smile or yawn would open up the passage way and VROOM comes wind noise at 60 MPH.

The Shure units are much more low-profile, fitting more in the ""cup"" of the ear (not sure the proper term). They have never suddenly come lose and lost their acoustic seal.

The cable which comes with these ear buds is solidly built - good for motorcycle use (think what a live stage musician would do to them, night after night... the cable is sturdy and well-made).

Note that there is no iPhone remote control or mic on this cable, though Shure sells a rather expensive one that I may buy soon, after my existing $15 version I bought fails (that is, the second one I bought, as the first cheapie already died). So... as always you get what you pay for.

And on a motorcycle, where ruggedness and reliability matters (because distractions are dangerous), I'll suggest these buds to anyone.

Enjoy!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are pretty good. The sound quality for the prices is about what I was expecting. The foam pieces that come installed on them are not that comfortable but the earbuds come with multiple tips that you can switch out to. The tips that are on it are very hard to get off. I found that one of the tips felt good in the ear but form a seal completely inside your ear and can lead to some ear pressure issues (i have sensitive ears).
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic in ear monitors, when they work. They sound amazing, and if you get the right tip size and fit, very comfortable and secure. I am disappointed, however, that after about 10-15 uses, and not doing anything rough with them, that the left ear bud appears no longer to output sound. I have tried different devices and configurations, but either I got a faulty pair or the cables may not be as strong as I would hope...so now I have to buy new cables just to see whether it is the cables or the left unit itself. With such a great start, I am, honestly, a bit disappointed..."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like Shure headphones this is my second pair, my first lasted about 3 years. I really like the sound (I am not an audiophile) of the head phones, nothing is over powering. I will say though that after while, they get very uncomfortable for me. I was on a flight from LA to Sydney and about 6 hours in, they were pretty painful in my ears.

I am keeping them but have ordered another set of earphones from Amazon to try for my next long flight."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound. isolates extremely well, I missed my station on the subway! uncomfortable to wear and get used to at first, but I got eventually got the hang of it. People stare at me funny as I loop it around my ears though. The clear one looks a lot prettier on screen than in real life. In person, it's a dull grey and looks unfinished and cheap and ugly and industrial looking. I might get klispch again just because it looks prettier."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a drummer at my church, so I primarily use these as in-ear monitors for a live music performance application. The buds are designed for maximum isolation from outside noise (great for drummers!), which helps preserve the bass frequencies. These are fantastic, especially for the price. I've owned and demo'd earbuds costing 2-3 times as much that didn't sound as good as these. I was especially pleased with the bass response; I can't understand how a single-driver earbud has this nice of a range. I ordered the clear ones, which don't stand out as much visually (a good thing!) Music from my iPod sounds great too; they handle a variety of musical styles very well. Easily the best earbuds I've used at this price; I would reccommend these to anyone, especially musicians."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why is it so hard to find decent headphones? These do not sit comfortably on the ear, the sound is medicore for the price.

But the real issue is that they are cheaply made. Mine have broken (sound is no longer coming from right bud) not 3 months owned. I've had second hand free headphones last longer.

Do not buy these, or any product from this manufacturer."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these in ear headphones. It took me a moment tho realize that there were indicators to tell me which ear piece was left and which was right. Once I realized that the sound improved tremendously.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for motorcycle riding and wish I'd got them years ago. Much better than cheaper ear buds for isolating wind noise even if not listening to music.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these! I initially found the foam tips to be extremely tight fitting because I never had over the ear-earbuds, but now that i've gotten used to it, I'm never looking back. These keep out sound extremely well and have very good quality music- especially for the price you're paying. I found that the wires are a bit long, so I bought the shorter ones and replaced them."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these headphones in. Sound quality is amazing. The cord is very solid, it's not like your average headphones with the cheap wiring. The wire is actually covered by a tough and sturdy material so it seems pretty hard to actually separate the wire from the buds. The only downside to this product is putting it in your ear. I had a hard time putting these into my ear because I was not familiar with structure of the earbuds. It takes some time to get use to it. My only tip is to shape the wire around your ear before placing the buds into your ear canal. Once I got the earbuds in, the fit was fine. I can barley hear anything after they have been placed in properly.

Overall the quality of the product and the sound quality of the earbuds are excellent. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for high end earbuds."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These do a great job of blocking out wind noise while riding my motorcycle, which is the primary reason I bought them. They are comfortable on long rides, even if they are sometime hard to get situated right under my 3/4 helmet. The only reason that I took away a star is that it requires you to buy another $50 cable to control your music on your phone, and the cable they offer is not very good compared to the stock cable."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Summary:
-This is my 4th pair of Shure's.
-Owned E2C's and older models.
-These are the best (and cheapest) so far.
-I use custom molded castings of my ear-canals made by my ear-doctor and the sound isolation/sound quality is absolutely amazing. I'm a helicopter pilot and use them for hearing-protection everyday.
-Slightly less comfortable

Pros:
-Bass is deeper and more pronounced than other models I've owned. I'm very particular about sound and like a good balance...have to say that the bass is unquestionably an improvement. I use a graphic equalizer with my player and these have a much broader range of adjustability...some people say they have too much bass, but if you actually take the time to adjust your equalizer, you'll find that you just have more control. The bass response is therefor quite satisfying as it is never pushing the driver near any limits. Rich, deep, period.
-Shure's have always been my go-to brand but I've always broken the wires by month 12-14. The modular wire system in these new models is pretty much the answer to that problem.
-They look cool. especially with my clear ear-canal castings.

Cons:
-They don't fit in the ear as well as previous models...a little big so they contact my cartiladge and irritate it over time if not adjusted properly. I suspect that it is my custom ear-canal inserts so I wouldn't worry about it unless you're going that route.
-Because of ^ and the fact that the wire-plug can swivel, they take a little longer to put on/take off...you kinda have to get everything all setup before you pop it under your hair/glasses and into your ear."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had shure earphones before and needed to replace my current one when the ear piece broke after many years of excellent service. I went straight to Shure and started researching models and chose the SE 215-K. It isolates sounds in the airplane but you can still hear when the communications come on or if the flight attendant speaks to you. This one is better because it stays in the ear even if you make sudden moves and the sound is better than the older one.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Crazy sound isolation - when these are in I cannot hear a thing. The soft flexible sleeves that conform to your ears does an exceptional job blocking out sound. The cables feel very sturdy so my fear of detached wires after a year or so of usage is no more. One of the best (if not the best) sound isolating earphones I have purchased and used. As usual, cannot beat Amazon pricing and I would highly recommend."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them in May and the sound already cuts out from both ears if the wires move a certain way. Faulty connector or bad quality cables. Disappointed considering these are fairly expensive and this is a result from regular use and keeping them always stored in the bag it came with.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never liked isolating in-ear earphones before, because usually I bought cheap ones which made bad sound, and uncomforting feeling. Besides that I have pretty big ears so my earbuds would always fell out on bicycle/running/other activity. I just ruined my Apple's new earphones when I broke on my bicycle and they fell out of my ears into the tires..

Ok, let's go to Shure SE215-K. This are the most expensive earbuds I ever bought (even though $ 90 some people don't consider as really expensive). I love the sound, they never fell out of my ears on the bicycle/running. They isolate all the sound around me when I listen to the music (so people have to wave at me if they want to talk).

It gets really windy in Hawaii and I was never able to listen to audio books on my bicycle on windy days, now I can.

When I first inserted earphone into my ears it took me some time. Now I can get them in in less than 10 seconds :)

I just love there earphones, and am just sad I didn't buy them before."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nothing short of amazing for a mid-frequency set of earphones. The isolating cushions are like actual plugs (makes sense, these are for monitoring), and keep the kids screaming in the next room out of my head while I'm working. My only regret is not getting the version with the in-line controls, and that I couldn't drop the cash on one of the sets with a wider frequency range. I can only imagine that the $999 set sounds like an iMAX theater."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones! Would buy again.
I use them as IEM's for my rock band.
Full balanced sound...make sure you use the best
fitting tips. Believe it or not this greatly improves the
bass response. At first I tried the wrong size tips and
was less than pleased. Once I got the right seal it
also increased the noise reduction. Great product.
I have tried the SE525 series at a friends house for
comparison...they hold up well. If you have the extra
cash you can spring for the 525's but if you are on a
budget like me, get the 215 series!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have returned these headphones.

They can be a little cumbersome to get to fit in your ears. It takes some practice to get them right. Overall the comfort is pretty good but I could see them popping out of your ear at times. The quality of construction is good and i can see them being durable over time.

Audio quality:
They can get loud, but, they do not offer much low end. Its mostly high and mid range.

They do seem to block the outside noise pretty well.

For me they didnt give me what I was looking for. Im going to stick to my iPhone earbuds and continue to search."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these little guys used with new tips on them for $85 including shipping from here. I was pretty hesitant spending that much on a set of earbuds but since my band is trying to set up a custom motioning system and these were the cheapest we could find with the best reviews, we all ended up going for the SE215's. I was blown away by the quality first off, I could hear things that my set of $150 mixing headphones wouldn't pick up on. And they actually stay in my ears! I haven't even felt them close to falling out yet.

Apart from using these with my band, I also have been taking them to work (I work in a metal machine shop) and I gotta say the sound isolation on these are insane. I can barely even hear the machines, quiet sections of songs still ring right through and even reverb is audible. They are also very comfortable with the right ear-insert. They do take a bit of getting used to because of the over-ear design but honestly they have become more comfortable than any other earbud I've used. I still don't know if they are worth $100 but I'm definitely not, by any means, kicking myself for buying these."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them for the gym. Sound quality is outstanding, and I'm sure the cable rot is not going to happen here like it did with my previous Shure EC2's - though with those it even started to happen several years after I got them - because they've included a rubber thicker layer around the ear area. Other headphones don't stay in my ears, these will only fall out if I pull them."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for almost a year now, and enjoy the sound quality just as much now as I did on the first day. They have held up very well during the time I've had them, and I use them everyday and sometimes in rough conditions; the single sign of wear is that the ""SHURE"" logo on the side has faded slightly. The comfort level is fine, as they are made to be molded to your ear and hold that position fairly well over time. In terms of relative sound quality, these out-perform anything at a similar price range, Bose included (in my opinion).
A note on the earpieces: I use the stock round silicone ones occasionally, and these are fine for most use. However, I recommend buying the triple-flanged earpieces from Shure if you are after noise-isolation (search Shure EATFL1-6, they should be about $8 and are well worth it)."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a lot of good things about this product. I don't even know where to start.

The cables are thick and firm (more so than normal earphones. Some might not like how it retains a little of it's shape), and extremely well reinforced. You know all those places where you break your cable at? Well not anymore...

Also, not many how much they move around, there's no vibrations to be heard. That's something not too many earphones can be proud of.

Detachable cables. I didn't even know about this when I bought it. Basically, you can detach the actual earphone pieces from the cable for replacement (the cable that is). It just pops right out, but only if you want it to: it has a good mechanism to keep it in place.

Clear headphones? I normally don't care about the color (unless it's pink) but making it see-through was a great idea. I like to see the cables inside of it.

A lot of people have trouble actually putting these things on. Even I had trouble with it at first (even though I already had one pair of shures before). They're only cables, but they're also over-the-ear models. Most Shures are I think. They wrap around the top of your ear and slide down to fit comfortably into your ear. It's comfortable, but some might not like how it does that. Don't even try and put them in like conventional headphones. It won't work.

You get two types of earpieces: a soft malleable type, and a hard plastic type. The soft type is great to block out a lot of exterior noise, but it gets dirty real quick. It's kind of nasty if you plan on sharing your earphones with others. The hard type doesn't get dirty whatsoever, but the quality drops, meaning you can hear the outside.

This product is absolutely amazing. And for half of the price it's a damn steal. Not to mention you also get a year of warranty included. I recommend this product 100%, and I applaud Shure for getting it right."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start this out by saying that if you've never owned high end earbuds/IEMs, you will most likely love these. If that describes you I would unequivocally recommend these as the sound quality, bluetooth technology, sound isolation, comfort, and battery life are all above to well above average. It takes some practice to properly insert the buds in your ear but you’ll get it.

Now, audiophiles. As a musician and general audio fanatic that has used Shure products for years, to my ears these are about a 8/10 value for the $150 price point. They are good but not great.

To start with the good, the lows are powerful but sometimes too much so. The single sound driver in these buds overstates the lows so I’ve found tweaking EQ to increase treble from your playback source to be very helpful, especially if you’re using a program like iTunes or Spotify. I listen to a variety of music including jazz, rock, pop, hip hop, classical, and I would say that across genres the bass is pleasant and adequate with the “treble booster” EQ adjustment.

Now the problem is with the mids and even more with the highs. The mids are undeniably muddy. This becomes obvious with heavily layered tracks where the instruments and effects struggle to distinguish themselves. The cutting clarity that I expect to hear from a cymbal crash or a piercing guitar note just isn't there.

I'm comparing these to the old school Shure E3C series (comparable to the current SE315) which had some design flaws but sound-wise are a big step up -- enough so that I plan to upgrade these at some point to either the SE315 or SE535s.

In sum, these are entry level Shure buds and to me they sound like it. Overall I'm still glad I bought them, but they are not quite what I had hoped for based on the early reviews here."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in-ear monitors for the price. Incredible, crisp sound, especially for a single driver unit. I have considered many times dropping the several hundred dollars to get a pair of custom molds, but I can't help but wonder if they will really be that much of an improvement upon my current SE-215s. Keep in mind, I use these several times a week as a touring musician. I have used many other brands, and these are the ones I keep coming back to. Eventually I feel that I will cave and get custom molds, but I couldn't recommend these more for a musician on a budget, or for an audiophile looking for great quality."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paid about 100 dollars and after about a year, they still work great. I wear these running and to the gym. So sweat was never an issue. And I like how these go behind the ears. When when you have an occasional tug on the wires, they don't fall out of your ears like other earphones. Nice sound isolation. Bass is good but not bumping. Wouldn't mind a little more bass. Wire length a little too long but better than short. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cable near right ear broke and audio keeps cutting until I re-adjust it. Very annoying. Wish I could return/replace them.
The ear cushions are very stiff and painful in my ears. I had to switch them with my old Klipsch S4's silicone cushions which are softer on my ears."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These were purchased as a gift for my son. He really likes the headphones. But the earpieces are a beast to take off and swap out. You almost feel like you are tearing them up in order to take them off. I would think an easier design would have been made. Other than that we are satisfied with the product.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Son likes them. He claims he can't hear me talking to him when he's wearing them. I don't know if that's good or bad.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is nice. They fit well and are comfortable. But in the past 2 years we've had 6 pairs and had issues with 5 of them and I think we take really good care of them. We only use them once a week. Be it a bad cable, an ear going out, something has gone wrong with all most all of them. They were under warranty, but it gets old either getting a replacement cable or sending it in to get a new ear. I believe there are better options that hold up longer and some that are even cheaper."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're great and fit very well. The cable is extremely long and it doesn't come with some sort of cable management. Sony ships theirs with a little wraparound thing and MeElectronics ships theirs with an actual clip. Considering how long the cable is, it would be nice if it came with something to handle it (Seriously, I'm 5'8"" and the cable is almost as long as I am tall)."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had one pair of these before and sold them because i needed the money. Bought again because is the best for the cost i could find and they serve my purpose either on live stage and home recording monitorizing. Will buy again if i need to.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love in-ear headphone with excellent audio quality, plus a noise cancelling feature, your search is over. The price is high but the experience is worth every single penny. I'm currently using it at work and is so light to wear, and more than that external noise doesn't bother me anymore. I don't recommend using it outdoor, might be dangerous to not listen sirens, honks etc."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've used like Shure products for the last 10 years or so. I like to mainly use these while working out because of the way they are worn (loop over back of the ear) as they prevent then from pulling out if the cord is yanked. These are pretty good although I like the older ones (fit) better for some reason. The cord is very long - a bit too long in my opinion as it sometimes gets in the way. Good sound for shure. :) Good seal too.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these as my in ears when we preform. All I can say is wow what a difference these can make for vocals. Very clean and these handle bass so much better then my other cheap pair. I would recommend these to any singers who want to take it to the next level when performing.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great drummer ear phones!
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading many reviews on various headphone, I selected these as a Christmas gift for my college age son.
I have experience with Shure record cartridges from back in the day, and they always delivered great sound.
These were delivered days ahead of the anticipated schedule and the box was packed well and the product was as ordered.
My son began wearing the headphones the afternoon of Christmas and instantly made comment as to the sound quality compared to the ear buds he had been using with his I-Phone. After a week or so of him being back for the Christmas break, I asked if I could try out and hear how these shure headphones delivered music. He was happy to show me the way to put these in the ear and drape the cord over my ear. I experimented with various music from his I-Tunes and then played some music off Pandora on my own I-Phone. I found the sound very clear, clean and dynamic. The buds felt comfortable in my ears. They also did a tremendous job of blocking out any outside noise! When I go to replace my own headphones, these will be ones I purchase. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and my son is VERY PLEASED with the gift. These are extremely well built, fit the ear like a professional studio ear bud, deliver great sound and are available at a price point that wont break the bank, but that also makes you aware to take care of them as they are a fine product."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them while practicing drumming with either my laptop or iphone. Otherwise I have Vater earplugs for drumming. I have ringing in my ears (all the time) from not protecting my hearing the first 40 years...

They sound really great. I can't complain at all about the sound. I think they are at least as good as my Bose IE2. So 5 stars in this department.

They come with different ear foam inserts. This is great. I can't say any of them are perfect, but you can play around until something works well enough. I can get the right level of noise dampening versus hearing the drums. I give them 4 stars here. The ear inserts really are nothing better than cheapo $10 earphones. You just get foam and rubber options of various sizes. I would have expected something a little higher quality (for example, see the $20 earplugs that they have for music listening which are just oh-so-slightly better).

There is an interesting feature where the earbuds detach easily (but not too easily -- a good thing!) from the cords because the cords are always what fails on earphones. I really like this feature -- but they are new and I only use them playing the drums so I don't know if I will ever take advantage of this. Pretty neat idea and build execution!

They really smell when you get them! I hate smelly plasticy things! It was stinking up my music room. It's been a couple months and I wiped them down with rubbing alcohol (not sure if that helped or not). So now they don't seem to smell anymore. But come on! It is such a turn off to get your brand new expensive (expensive for earbuds, but sure not luxury items I get it... ) electronic thingy and it wreaks like... well sickly plastic fumes.

Now that the smell is not an issue, my complaint is that the way they stay on is janky. The cords closest to the earbuds are bendable and stay int he shape you bend them in. So you kinds of create an over the ear hook so they stay on. Contrast these with the Bose IE2 which are a dream (I get that the noise blocking feature is way different than the IE2 earbuds which allow ambient noise in so you don't get run over while jogging, etc.) I wish they really did something different with this part. The functionality/fit is *meh*.

So in summary (sorry about the length!) I dislike the smell, the only adequate quality foam/rubber inserts, and the moldable wire supports.

I am getting more used to them as I use them more, but I don't think I will ever love them. I am too picky for that to happen."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say? It's my second pair of mid fi products and I love it. These IEMs are a solid choice for somebody getting into higher audio. If you want something that is more ""fun"", this is for you. It has a really strong impacting bass that is accurate as well. The mids are fine, nothing special but there isn't much range on the treble and isn't as great there. Its a comfortable pair of IEM's to me, however some people may not enjoy the over design of the earbuds. For anybody wondering, they work fine with glasses as well. I would highly recommend these for anybody looking at a $100 purchase."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding in-ear monitors. The sound quality is outstanding. Figuring out how to put them on is not easy. There are several ""cushions"" included for proper fit - trying a few to get the right comfort and sound is critical. One type [expandable] I tried felt good; but after wearing for an hour were VERY uncomfortable .... switching to another type worked perfectly. I use these for listening to recorded music and also for live sound with a band - they work well for both. As you'd expect from Shure - these are high quality and well-built earphones. My previous monitors were Ultimate Ears that boasted of strong low end ... they were good but not nearly as good as the Shure, The Shure monitors carry the whole spectrum without overly coloring the sound. I plan on using these for a long time."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very durable and quality headphones. If you like clarity and don't require an enormous amount of bass, then these will do just fine. I love mine, the inserts take some getting used to but I prefer the foam over the rubber. They come with both so it's all personal preference."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to earbuds. Once I found the correct sized ear tip, these fit like a dream. I ended up choosing one of the memory foam cushion tips, which fit very much like earplugs, and these earbuds fit better than anything I've ever used before. I can honestly wear these for hours on end without complaint. An amazing fit, great sound, and a good value. Love these!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great with these, with the caveat that if you are using a lower quality music player (such as many smartphones) these will also help you hear the deficiency of your music player. They do a great job with noise isolation, so you can work in a noisy cafe without being distracted. They also have about 2-3"" of heavy-gauge wiring just next to the earbuds that stays in shape so you can bend the around your ear to keep them in place."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215s were apparently just the ticket for her!

She mostly listens to dubstep and other bass-heavy music. The Se215s are often mentioned as particularly good for dubstep and electronica, and se seems extremely happy with them. Another thing she appreciates is the good selection of extras they come with.

Excellent for the price, would buy again. In fact I did, as my daughter lost the first set through a freak accident :("
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones, having purchased Shure headphones previously. The original were great until the dog chewed off one one!! I purchased these thinking that the would be as good as the ones minus one end. Wrong. They didn't sound as good, and now one side doesn't work at all. Is this today's quality control? If I can exchange them, I will try another pair."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good but I find the ear pieces regularly need me to adjust them or put them back in, especially when I'm exercising. I tried more than one size, which came with the order. I wish I had bought another pair of Bose earbuds, which are a different shape and much more comfortable. The Shure ones are like ear plugs that you must wedge into your ear canal. For this price range, I expected them to be more comfortable."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Absolutely love these!

Pros: Great sound, incredible noise isolation, long cable, great memory foam ear tips with lots of size compatibility, very good fit, very comfortable, best earphones I have ever had. Better that Powerbeats and Klipsch Custom 3's

Cons: Maybe cable length, noise isolation is very good making these possibly unsafe for outdoor use

I looked at a lot of earphones and I am really glad I went with these. Perfect for working out. They never fall out of my ears or even come loose. Also very sweat and moisture resistant."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect sound, these are my favorite all purpose earbuds. Supreme comfort with the memory foam tips, and VERY high quality sound for the price.

Not to mention, they fit so snug and flat that I can fall asleep with them in, and I often do use them to fall asleep, while listening to ASMR videos. The only better earbuds I can imagine would be the higher SE models by Shure. (I literally dream about opening a pair of SE846s)"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a believer! My boyfriend recommended these for our upcoming trip. I was considering Bose noise cancelling, but did not want the bulk. These come in a very compact bag and cancel out the jet noise and chatter on planes. I also bring them to work now so I don't hear the background noises of chatter, keyboards, phone calls, pagers that can irritate me. Excellent 100 bucks spent."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Obviously different, but I was worried at first about the fit. They definitely sit differently in my ears. They do not go in nearly as far as the SE110s. I had the medium sized FOAM plugs on my other pair, so I figured the medium would be the best on the 215s. Nope, far too small to give a good fit and block out ambient noise. I switched to the large foam plugs and got a good fit. They do not block out ambient noise as well as the SE100s did for me, but the sound is better. The bass is clearly superior to the 110s. I run regularly with them in, and there are no issues with them falling out. The less pliable cord that goes around the ears can be annoying, but you just need to use the cinch/tightener on the cord and they stay in place fine. Taking a little bit to get used to, but I really like them now."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i use these in ear monitors mostly while riding my motorcycle and they replaced my SE210's which bit the dust. Overall I have to say I liked the SE210's better, but of course they are discontinued so I thought I would try their replacement the SE 215 which were acutally a lttle cheaper.

The SE210's were a bit more comfortable and I believe had slightly better sound. The SE215's have a more robust cord which was a negative on the 210's. The cord is also easily detachable in case it breaks, but is a one piece design instead of the two piece design of the 210's I liked that I could unplug the cord of the 210's in the middle of the cord instead of at the device input. Gave more felexibility for using.

As for the sound, they sound very good, but like i said, I thought their predessesor had better sound quality and were a little more comfortable.

Overall I give it 4 stars out of 5."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Shure headphones for years. They make a great product and their quality is fantastic, but at a lower cost than many of the competitors.

The latest models have replaceable cables, as those are very often the first pieces go to through wear and tear. But the earbuds themselves keep on working great, cable after cable."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you're sitting on the fence these are worth it! Great company. Great first pro earbuds. Best price for quality pro earbuds won't find quality this cheap. Surprised cord hasn't ripped I sat down with cord wrapped around something metal and the headphones nearly ripped out of my ears and they still sound great and cord is fine.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these earphones to practice with my band (I play bass) and have gigged with them several times. I've also used them on plane flights, and they cut ambient noise as well as high end over the ear phones. They only have one driver, so the bass response isn't great, but for the money I've been quite pleased. They come with several different sizes of rubber ear pieces, so one of them is likely to fit you."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Using them as Aviom monitors on-stage every week. Good isolation, full bass, clear highs, good mids.,. there is no comparison between these and regular earbuds. Once levels and stereo placement of other group sends were set on aviom, it was great to set my guitar feed in the middle and let it roll. Also, these are comfortable, Only negative I can list is it takes a little effort to get them in and pull them out. Definitely a great bargain alternative to custom IEM's costing, after ear molds from an audiologist, $500.00 to $800.00 or more depending on your wallet (and ego...:) ). Also great to passively listen to music with, just realize that normal conversation is not an option while wearing these...wife thought I was ignoring her. For passive listening, recording reproduction is very pleasing, if not ""studio monitor"" accurate. Very sweet sound."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these iem I was stunned at the lack of bass that they had but after some burn in the bass started to show though. Now if you are looking for deep thick bass look else ware but if you are looking for crisp clean bass these fit the bill very well. With the corect tips these iem can really tune out noise so be careful if out and about. Thes iem are very easy to drive cleanly running on just about any sourse but seem to not gel well with tube amps.

For referance other cans I own are ath m40s, grado 325 woody and cable mods, dathbyers."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hearphones. Thick and durable cord, three sizes of ear pieces and the best part: the music. Sound is really good and bass is deep, mids are punchy and highs are crisp. I listen to a variety of music from jazz to classic rock to hip hop and most everything in between. They shine on all fronts. Sound isolation is great. I've listened to these at 35,000 feet and had no issues. The only drawback I get is problems getting them to stay in when I run but the sound overrides that. I would recommend if you're not a snobby $800 hifi headphones type yet still want some great earphones for whatever."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I've had a set for years and bought this set for my son's birthday. They're durable and comfortable. I often use them while waiting for my son at Taekwondo class. I can hear what I'm listening to at a minimum volume level, all while kids are shouting."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product sounds great, I have had no issues with it as of yet. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a professional quality sound isolating earphones. I have heard that this product has a tendency to break after a few months. If this is the case for me, I will update my post here. However, as of this moment (owning the Shure SE215-CL for a little over a month) they work great and this customer is very satisfied."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound fantastic, and the included ear pads work better than my custom-made Westone hearing protectors to cut outside sound. Perfect for use in noisy environments or on stage. Note that the ear pads may not work well for everyone -- at all depends on the size and shape of your ear canals."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed...my first Shure war buds back in the day had better sound quality and were bullet proof. The 215’s I’ve has for some time now and have been struggling with each bug intermittently cutting out. It’s been irritating but usually resolves after a little adjustment of the wires. Now - no luck. Left bud is dead. After doing so research seems likes a common problem. Not Shure I’m going to try another pair.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace a pair of SE310's I left on a plane. Sound quality is excellent, exactly what I expect from shure-clear notes and balanced sound. The multiple included eartips makes it easy to find the ones that work best for your ears. The external body of the headphones is larger than it appears, slightly uncomfortable for me, but maybe I'll get used to it in time. It is flat, so it doesn't hurt your ear if your head is laying against a pillow or airplane seat. If the external body of the headphones was slightly smaller, I'd give this product 5 stars."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just unboxed these after they were delivered today, so I can't speak to their longevity. But after listening to music for a good hour, all I can say is 'wow.' These things sound great and are comfortable in my ears. The noise isolation is incredible, they function just like ear plugs. I can't wait to try them on an airplane.

As of now, I highly recommend them. I hope they stand up to the daily abuse I will be putting them through."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I did a LOT of research on looking for a high quality pair of earphones. After purchasing this I am very happy. They sound fantastic. A lot of comments on how hard they are to put in, but once you get it down, it's no problem. The only thing to be weary of is the sound isolation - they do a fantastic job of isolating, but you must be careful around traffic, or any other dangerous activity."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is wow. I have always been a huge Bose fan probably due to the advertising and decent sound quality (was perfect quality until now). A few days ago I would of swore that my three pair of Bose headphones had all others beat, I was totally wrong. As soon as I put these on and fired up the first song I immediately got a huge smile. Then I was disappointed, not disappointed at my new Shure headphones but more that I had wasted money on Bose for years. Let me go back to the start first though.
I researched headphones like crazy wanting the best sound possible. I kept finding articles saying Shure. I had never heard of them so I was unShure (unsure) about spending money on something I haven't tried or heard of. I had both Bose and Shure headphones in my shopping cart. I kept removing the Shure headphones because I didn't want to waste my hard earned money on and unknown brand to me. Finally I was tired of the back and forth and removed the Bose and bought the Shure. I am so glad I did.
I received my headphones two days later and opened them struggled to get them on my ears. These aren't like normal earbuds it took me a good five minutes to get it right. I had music playing but it sounded terrible because I couldn't get them the right way on my ear. As soon as the earbud slipped in the right way I was sold. I heard things that I had never heard in my music before. Every note was crystal clear. The bass was perfect and deep without being overwhelming. My kids were playing and being loud but the earplug type of earbud completely cut them out. I have listened to many songs now and I have never heard my music so perfect and accurate. These things blow Bose out of the water. I see a lot of questions on Amazon asking how they are compared to Bose. If you are reading this (my first review ever) I can tell you to take the leap and you too will be a Shure fan for life. I will definitely try more of the higher priced versions in the future. I will probably never get to try the Shure SE846 due to the price at least until I get my kids through college then I might treat myself for doing an awesome job as a parent. On another note it did come with a nice case, ear pieces, and cleaning tool. In all honesty though the earbuds are the only thing that is important here. My one and only negative is that due to the clarity and perfect sound representation is that some artists that used lower quality mixing or whatever would degrade there sound quality can be heard. These headphones allow you to hear the improfections perfectly which isn't an issue with the headphones at all. It shows the quality of sound being released by these. I will update my review if I run into any issues. If you don't see an update it's because I love these and have had no issues. You might also see bigger and better reviews on the better models of Shure headphones as I purchase them...can they get better? I don't know how they could but we will see.

Update: I have had these over a week now. I have spent way to many hours listening to music with these. I am still impressed with the quality and the bass these can pump out. I notice things in songs I have never heard before. I am a huge fan of these headphones. I will never change brands again....might just upgrade to better models in order to see how the better models perform."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds I've ever invested in. This is in fact my third pair I am buying because I had initially gifted one to my boyfriend and I lost my first pair (a moment of silence for the lost pair).

Thank you God for Amazon.com's easy ordering process. Got a better color too (in my opinon). Only downside is I can't workout with this. But WHATEVER I use this to work which is SUPER essential for better productivity."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE215-K headphones a little over a week ago and have been overall happy with them.

Two minor issues:1) The plastic part of the L-plug is too large in diameter for these to fit in my portable devices with a case on them. Neither my Galaxy Note nor my Tablet. 2) they take a little practice putting them on. It's taken me a while to get where I can put them on one-handed as they really need to be seated in your ear canal for best sound. The different sized ear pieces help, but they do take a little of practice put them on easily.

That said, I really like the sound... it's even and doesn't have any of the harshness I found in a lot of small driver in-ear headphones."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat upped cymbals around 2-4khz band but not irritating. The rest is pretty good including the bass response where some might be wondering. Very clear sound but people looking for a good sound stage and neutral sound should better look at something else.

The detachable cable is not as great as I expected since you need to use the same special cable from Shure but it is indeed a relief in case you frequently get your cord damaged like my brother.

Putting them onto your ears is a challenge at first few times but you get used to it and the plugs are quite great."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me awhile to get the hang of inserting these in my ears quickly, but after a few days my lack of coordination was resolved. :)) These have very good sound quality, stay inserted (I've never dislodged them or needed to reseat them in the ear), and they do a good job of blocking outside noise. My gym has several obnoxiously loud people, and the SE-215's allowed me to workout in complete bliss. Also, I feel no soreness whatsoever in my ear after a 60-minute workoout. Another brand used previously was NOT comfortable in hindsight."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit and sound ""Fantastic""!! It took me just about a minute to figure out how to put them on as it is not as hard as some others had made it out to put them on and they are ""Sound Isolating"" as I work in a US Postal Processing Facility and they are very quiet."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First let me start off by saying that the sound quality is excellent on the e215. I only had two complaints, 1. It does not include a microphone and the microphone cable that you can buy separately is not coated with the same flexible material that wraps around the base of the e215's cord to help keep them from falling out your ear. 2. The sound would cut in and out if I moved the cord. I looked online and found this to be a common issue with Shure. Amazon exchanged them for another pair and they are now working perfectly. Dispite the issues I had with these earbuds just by judging from comfort and sound, these are the best earbuds I've ever owned."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried most of the brands in the market but I've never seen something like this before. It's a complete professional item. Unlike beats by dre(just bass and the rest is below average), Shure has proven in all kind of genres. You actually hear the other instruments that you've never heard in the song you always listen. Material has way more quality than any other brand except those $500 ones. This item is underrated!"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son has these and loves them. Bought them on his recommendation. Had a hard time to get them to fit correctly. Tried the different ear pieces and sizes. I don't think they are that sound isolating. Especially for the price. They are better than the earphones that come with the iPod.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Somehow I don't like those active noise cancellation earphones which depend on batteries. This one works very well by just isolating the noises. Used them on flight and while mowing the lawn, not completely silent, but enough that I can still enjoy music and movies."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were bought for only one purpose - for use in the office to disconnect from everyone else and not be able to hear anyone else. THEY MEET THAT GOAL 100%.

However, their downside is the bluetooth mic. HAD THESE headphones had no mic - I WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM.
The mic is poorly placed as it sits behind your ear - which is the typical way of wearing these headphones - makes it hard for anyone else to hear you. So unless you are prepared to talk loudly, avoid these."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great the fit is amazing and I can't hear anything outside while I have them in. The little over the ear part of the cable can look stupid though so I bend them a little tighter so they tuck behind my ears.

They were easy to fit, initially easy to set up and the sound is nice. Isolation is better than I thought. The cords are tough and durable. Audio response is better than I imagined. Highs, mids, and lows are clean and clear. Even for my hearing impairment. They are very impressive and sound good enough to use with players or phone. They are very comfortable. Shure has made a nice earphone here. Highly recommended."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a shure headphones that are not comfortable but I love the sound, so I thought I might give it a try on shure earphones.

Overall, I think this particular model would work better for those who want to listen to music in a very noisy area.
It does a great job of isolating the sound, but I really don't like how you hear your own movement; It's great if you don't move at all of course.

I prefer flat sound but this has that bassy sound that I don't like. After setting the EQ on my pc, it kind of solves it.
The sound is pretty clear and good but it's just not clear enough for an FPS game (I find that no matter how I change the EQ and sound effects, I can't hear some sounds as clearly as with my other earphones).

The built quality is great. It's the most sturdiest pair of earphones I owned. No quation there.
The way it's worn + the noise isolation makes me think that it's defnitely more suitable for musicians who need monitoring outside (like at a concert). I don't really recommend this if you are gonna be in a quiet house.

For the price, I am not really satisfied with my experience"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried almost every in-ear Bluetooth headphones and these are the best. They fit perfectly in my ear and do not fall out while working out or running. I use the foam earbuds and they form such a tight seal that it blocks out most of the noise when not in use. While in use I don't hear any outside noise. Even when mowing the lawn I can't even hear the lawn mower.

As far as Bluetooth goes. I did have an issue with dropouts but it's not the headphones, it's my phone. I have a Galaxy S8 + and there has been issues with that model. I was able to toggle airplane mode and I haven't had the issue since. I actually think it's a problem with the WiFi Stack and Bluetooth. Also, at the gym I have had no issues with dropouts, even when I am 40' away from my phone.

If you are looking at other headphones in this price range I can assure you they don't compare to these. I literally have tried just about all of them."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio quality is great. Fit takes a little bit of time to get used to and cable is longer than I would like 99% of the time + has a large connector that still got loose over time. After about 4 months of using these, the connection wore down enough where I could here fuzz if the cable moved around at all. I bought a replacement cable but same issue after less than three months."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for listening to my personal library of music, not as musicians ear buds or as the audiophile's best audio system, but as excellent earbuds for my music. How's the sound? Amazing! Better than my over the ear headphones. Takes a little practice to get the hang of getting them in and out of your ears, but they sound so good I hate to take them off. Someone will ask me a question and I think ""This better be good because the music shouldn't be interrupted!"" Are there better ones, probably, are these great for your library of music, yes!

The sound is absolutely amazing! I have a pair of mid-high quality earbuds I got for around $70 and I thought they were great, until I got these! Large dynamic range and holds those notes at the ends of the scale. They made me want to find my more sophisticated music to hear all the nuances I was missing. For $100 a real steal. I looked at about 12 different similar ear buds and finally went with the Shure name and I'm glad I did!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this device to use with my SE425 IEMs. Since Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone, I've been looking for a good wireless solution. All of the options out there carry some trade-off, even this device. There are other options out there, but I decided to go with this since I have had good experiences with Shure in the past for things like microphones and audio equipment.

About 90 days into owning this thing, it stopped working. At first, I thought the battery was just drained, so I plugged it in and left it to charge. I then noticed the battery got externally hot, and knew something was up. I sent it back to Shure using the service RMA feature on their web site, and they sent me a new one at no charge. Based on the device alone, I would give this thing a 2, but the fact that Shure stood behind the product despite being slightly out of warranty was pretty classy.

Here is my take:

Pros:
-Good audio quality for music / sound output - out of the other Bluetooth adapters I have tried this one seems to be the best in this area at least in my opinion.
-Long battery life compared to other devices
-Lightweight / minimal and doesn't get in the way

Cons
-Horrific mic quality. It's garbage. Any bit of wind or outside noise will make it useless.This is really surprising considering these guys are known for making professional microphones.
-The volume of the voice prompts is cranked all the way up to the point of being painful."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,the cable is faulty. the left earpiece works fine but the sound on the right one constantly breaks up. you have to adjust the cable or never move your head. I am very much disappointed.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good headphones. I'm not an expert in sound quality so I can't use the buzzwords, but I can definitely tell the difference from stock Android headphones. The foam earplugs do a good job of cancelling out outside noise, and the sound is quite richer and the bass is quite deep.

One major criticism is the way they fit on the ears - the wires are meant to loop over the ears, and I find this to be very frustrating. It's hard to put them on without using both hands, and the memory wires around the earphones don't fit quite as well as I'd like. That's why I rated this four stars - otherwise, really nice headphones."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for use as backup in-ear monitors for live stage performance, and for the price on Amazon, they were a bargain compared to other pro monitors (like my Westone Elites). I play a variety of instruments, some of which require precise sound reproduction as well as isolating the rather loud on-stage wedges. Hearing a clear mix is critical, and I just needed inexpensive backups, so I wasn't counting on these meeting these lofty requirements.

These are nice earphones, and I now use them as my go-to in-ears. I even bought another pair for yard work and other activities where sound protection is needed.

I've had no quality problems after a few months of heavy use. These are well-made earphones using durable materials. The soft, moldable cable sleeves are designed to wrap around your ears, providing a comfortable, secure fit. These also have a cable ""cinch"" that can make the cables cling to the back of your head which helps prevent snagging. Unfortunately, I have to re-tighten it after an hour or so of playing. The driver housing's swivel design helps fit your outer ear better. Choose the size of the squishy ear buds correctly (included) and you won't know they're there after a while.

They do have a slight low-end punch that tends to emphasize sounds around 100 Hz (like kick drums), but it is not annoying. (Sometimes you can play with positioning in the ear canal to adjust bass punch.)

Over the years, I have collected a handful of favorite headphones (SONY MDRV55s, Sennheiser HDs, Bose Quiet Comfort for noise-cancelling), and while the Sure SE215s do not match the stratospheric audiophile quality of my favorites, they perform exceptionally well on-stage or when active and needing noise isolation."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me save you the money. I purchased the MEE M6 Pros about 2 years ago. They don't get heavy use but are used almost each weekend for in-ear monitors on stage. The sound isn't amazing and had some struggle picking up a good range but was good enough to hear the majority of the band and singers. However, when I came across the Shure's I thought I'd give these a try. I disregarded many reviewers that said the same thing I am about to say - the sound quality of these SE215 is equal to the M6 Pros even after getting comply tips. Seriously. Save the money unless you just want the name brand its not worth the purchase. If you want to get a better range you're going to need another driver in your IEM. I haven't tried the M7's but that would be my next purchase before moving up the Shure IEM line to get the daul drivers - talk about expensive.

FYI - the M6 is currently $45 on amazon. The M7's (dual driver) currently is $120. If you really want to spend double the price...buy the M6 and send me the rest =)!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a frequent traveler and I have had my Bose QuietComfort headphones for quiet sometime and overall very happy with it, until I tried some sound isolating earphones. Regarding the sound quality, there is not much to complaint about Bose, I'm happy with it and I can really enjoy my music in the aircraft due to its noise cancellation capability. But after trying these sound isolating earphones, there is no noise you need cancel as the noise is being isolated. 2 major features that I like are: 1) No batteries, don't have to worry about running out of batteries, 2) Size, this is much much much smaller than the Bose and it comes with a carrying case, that completely replaces my Bose QuietComfort..... well, I still use it at home, but it will not travel with me. So if you are looking for something light, easy to carry and travel with you and with very good noise canceling capability, give this a try."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound amazing and are easily the best pair on in-ear headphones I have found for ≤ $100. I anticipate that I will be able to use these for live IEM . My first real test will be this coming weekend so I will update this post accordingly.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a gift for my husband. He LOVES the earphones but hates the plasticky inserts for the ears, If you don't like them either, try using the foam earpieces that come with other brands that are like foam earplugs... As soon as he replaced those, he LOVED the earphones. He used http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078JXDRI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they work great."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS: Sound quality is solid for tiny earphones at this price point. Highs are clear. Lows are good enough. More importantly, they protect my ears. I can drum along to any track with the music at a safe volume and still hear my drums through the mix. It also comes with a nice carrying case, and they look pretty cool. I feel like a Backstreet Boy with these guys in my ears.

CONS: It is really pretty hard to change the earbud sizes though. The first time I finally managed to pull one off I thought I had broken the stem. Be careful taking them off, but you will also need a lot of force to do so. Don't put them in the fridge, like others have suggested.

Now to test their longevity!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product gave new life to my SE535 earphones! I am so happy that Shure came out with these (albeit with the Shure price tag). I am now able to enjoy the sound quality of my SE535's with my headphone jack-less iPhone X! As expected with most bluetooth devices, easy to setup and pair. Only wish they would make this with the Apple W1 chip for even more seamless connection to my iphone."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"See my review on my Shure EATFL1 earbud sleeves. These replace my good long time use earbuds and I am just as happy as I was with those pro units. Relativrly inexpensive and top quality sound. As a rock musician and a drummer these are everything I need to hear the bassist and the chimes and everything in between. Used with the sleeves they fit so much better and stay in place, however they remove easily."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I read reviews that outside noise was minimized and the design held the ear plugs in place. While the noise was reduced significantly, I did not find it as ""noise cancelling"" as some reviewers. However, it was sufficient enough that I was very satisfied with the results. Comfort was also good once you get the hang of plugging the buds and wrapping the wires.
Highly recommended."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't even know what I was missing until I got these. I wish they were a little smaller, as even with trying on the various ear pieces, after a hour or so my ears get sore, but the sound quality is worth it."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve needed a good set of in-ear monitors for a long time but also needed a good set of ear buds for listening to music and TV at home. I had been using a pair of Bose ear buds for about four years now. I paid a $100 for them thinking: “Ok, you get what you pay for.” Now, I don’t want to turn this review into a bad one for Bose but I’ve been very disappointed with them given what I paid. Let me just say that they have never given me the sound quality that I would have expected from Bose and this doesn’t count the poor fit and discomfort. And of course, they’re simply unworkable as in-ear monitors.
So finally, I sprung for these Shure SE215s and MAN, I AM IMPRESSED! – and for the following reasons:
1. Comfort – It took me a few minutes to figure out how they were supposed to fit. Then I discovered that several inches of the wire going into each bud is bendable so that I could mold it around my ear. It took me just a few more minutes to get them to fit perfectly. Then, with the variety of little rubber cushions that I could swap out, I got them to fit even better than perfect. And best of all, they just don’t pop out even when I shake my head. And the only time I even notice that they are in place is if I actually wonder about them. In other words, I feel them the same as I feel my shoes.
2. Sound quality – Of course, this is ALWAYS subjective but I have to honestly say that I decided to wear them and listening to some Gavin DeGraw and some Joe Bonamassa while I was reading through the documentation. OMG! I’m literally crying happy tears and hearing some things on my CDs that I have never heard before. Oh Yeah, these are THAT GOOD!
3. Next, I took them to my next gig and plugged them into the back of mixing board’s monitor speaker output. My board has enough of a pre-amp on it that I don’t need to amplify these Shures anymore than that. I work with a singer so, it’s just the two of us on vocals and my acoustic guitar …. but it’s ALL amplified up on stage. I cannot say enough good things about these. I am not the lead singer but this means I have to do the harmonies. This is harder to do that one would first believe and it is absolutely imperative that the harmony singer hear himself/herself. These SE215s do exactly what Shure claims they will do and just what I have been needing.
That’s enough for now. If any pro working musician is looking for the best bang for your buck in-ear monitors, these are the ones. I love them!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are freakin' awesome! The big sound they produce is pure magic and the noise reducing qualities are excellent. I've had ""noise cancelling headphones"" from other manufacturers that require batteries and power to work, and these solve that problem and provide much better sound quality too. Five thumbs up!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I was looking at these headphones, I was hoping that they would block enough noise to allow me to use them while drumming. I could not find that information in any review on the internet. To any drummers looking at these, they do cut the drum noise down to a level where you will not injure your ears or drown out the music you are listening to. On top of that you don't have to blast your music to get this. When I am listening to something while playing, I still only have to put the music at a very low volume. Also, I play with these in even if I am not listening to anything, using them simply to cut the drum noise. Basically, they work great for me as a drummer. The end."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these as an upgrade for my wife's in-ear monitoring we use in the band. She says these sound much better than the stock ones that came with the IEM system, and are more comfortable to wear"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these earbuds! Use them, wear them, enjoy them. They fit great. Sound great. I've owned three pair. That's the problem. The left earbud busts within 2 months with each pair I've owned. Not the wire which is usually the problem but the actual earbud itself. 1 right out of the box. To fix it costs almost half the original cost. A total love hate relationship. Hence the 3 stars."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had mine for years and I’m still using them. I had one cable go bad, but I’d say it was more my fault than anything else. Replacement cables can be found for $30, so it’s a much better option than buying entirely new earbuds. Other than that, they sound really good too"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start off by saying im not an audiophile. This is my 2nd pair of ""nice"" headphones. Ok on to the good parts about it. They have GREAT isolation. Almost too much haha. The sound quality is nice and clear. Dont know how to explain it very well but it was very flat.
The bad... I bought these for use in school or while doing homework thinking that itd help me concentrate. However i could not get past the how uncomfortable they are. Im not a picky person and thought they wouldnt be that annoying but i was wrong. Its very difficult to put on and by the time you get it in, it has already began to irratate you so you yank them out. The swivel connection was extremely loose and would just slide around while trying to put on. Cord is very annoying and heavy.
These are for performing musicians, not for the average person that wants good isolation. I made that mistake thinking theyd be ok for my day to day life. Overall very difficult to use and only mehh sound. Not for the average joe."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so these sound good ... but - the wires are very, very stiff. The stiffness even makes audible noises if you like turn your head. The way you loop them over your ear is weird. The noise canceling is by using these foam inserts which are weird to put in your ears. Worse of all - mine broke after light use and it's a hassle to do a return under warranty. I just bought something else instead."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent bang for the buck. Good isolation. A little weak on the low end compared to the multidriver models but when playing through a PA the clarity on stage is awesome.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound amazing and are some of the most rugged headphones I've ever had. They hook around the top of your ear and stick in your ear providing a very solid and soundproof setup. The sound quality is great, and the bass in these things is killer. The see through option is pretty cool also. For the price, they're really unbeatable if you're looking for a durable and high quality pair of earbuds"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are unlike any headphones/ear buds I have ever had.
They are flush in my ear. They reduce noise. They have great sound like full over-the-ear headphones.
Someone recommended these for wearing under a motorcycle helmet since you can listen to music and reduce the wind noise. They are good. I can't really hear the bike and only hear a little of the wind at highway speeds.
I also use them at the gym and they drown out the noises of a typical gym.
I also use them while mowing the lawn, in conjunction with over the ear hearing protection, and they work great. Cuts out even more noise and they sit in my ear flush so the other unit can also cover my ears.
Getting a full face motorcycle helmet on over these headphones can be challenging. That isn't the headphones fault, but its just the way it all works out. Just the nature of the beast. But once on, they work out really well.
I like the modular design as the ear phones come off, separate from the cord. Should the cord every break, in theory, I can buy a new cord.
There are 6 different sizes ear plugs in the package that allow you to find the perfect fit.
These are truly innovative."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had been relying on Jaybird X2 as my running headphones, did the job for the most part but outdoor BT connection is good but not great. For example with phone at waist bending over to tie a shoe results in audio dropout and some times just the turn of the head. Jaybird products after X2 have fared much worse that I no longer consider them so when this wireless Shure SE215 was announced I was ready to buy and try when available.

BT outdoor connectivity has been solid for me, only time I've ever experienced an audio dropout is when the battery became low and needed a charge. Otherwise I couldn't be happier with the wireless connectivity.

*Update* The Shure BT cable has stopped working, lasting only three months. Stopped working during a run and won't turn on or charge since. I assume sweat my have gotten on the controller and created a short. Too bad as they were great when used with a single driver ear piece but it does not appear to be sweat proof. If you plan to use this during a strenuous workout or hope to use with a Shure ear piece above the SE315, this solution will not be a good one.

8 hour claim of battery life is maybe a bit high but not outrageously so. I got almost a week out of use on a single charge, so maybe just under 7 hours.

I have always considered the Shure SE215 as best bang for the buck and sound is similar here. I have also always liked how they are small and disappear in the ear. And of course you could always attach higher quality phones if desired, though I do feel more comfortable sweating on SE215's than my SE846's.

Controls are good and easy to use, volume can get cranked up as high as you want. Also you can find out the estimate of remaining battery at any time through the controls.

The cable doesn't really lend itself to being reduced in length but I just clip it to my shirt and I never really notice it during my run. I suppose it would only be a problem if you had nothing to clip the wire to."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using in ear monitors for years now. These little puppies produce a vastly superior sound to my ear than any other ear headset I've experienced so far. The kick and bass guitar are strong and present. I like their low profile so that it's not obvious to the audience that you're wearing any earphones at all.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for drums and every day listening. They work great. I would be interested in seeing a frequency graph for these, because the range and decibel limit accross all frequencies is really high. These ARE studio monitoring headphones, after all. Anyone who says that these ""have enough bass but not too much"" isn't using a good MP3 player, because I am using the Poweramp app on my phone and the bass will go go as high as you want. Enough to shake your eardrums and give you an instant headache, with zero distortion! I turned it up just to test it, and didn't last long. The high power mid range compliments the thunderous bass. High end is crystal clear. They are also durable. 10/10, would buy again, and recommend.

Note: I experienced distortion while using my 5 year old iPod Classic but absolutely none while using my phone."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this pair to replace another se215 pair I’ve had for about 1 year that started crackleing after a friend used them. I Love the way they sound but after purchasing this new pair in October the right ear has quit working after two months. (It is now December) Going to try to contact Shure to see if they will replace them. Not happy. I will update when I either get good results or not.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bang for the buck. Being a drummer, I always had the issue of cheap earphones falling out of my ears. These wrap around your ear and make a sound proof seal, it is amazing. I should've bought these years ago, for the price, I don't think you can go wrong."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the most awesome earbuds anyone could want.. My boyfriend rides a motorcycle and that is the reason I got them for him.. They cancel all external noise and deliver a really crisp sound.. He also uses them on the lawn tractor... He let me try them to see how fabulous they are.... They truly met all our expectations
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I have now sent these back and had them replaced by Shure 5 times. At some point after a few months, one of the ears or both conks out. When they are working, they deliver top notch and high quality sound. And again, Shure stands behind their product and has consistently replaced them every time that I've sent them in. That said, I have sent them in 5 times. I think that the first order of business to making a great set of headphones, right behind sound quality, would be durability. Earphones are wrapped around fingers, stuffed into pockets, and jammed into bags. They deserve better care than they get I'm sure, but they need to be able to stand up to the day to day demands of the urban commuter.

This is my previous review and I do stand by it. High quality when they work!
First and foremost, the sound and fit of these headphones is wonderful. I live in New York City and they truly keep the sounds of the street and the subway out and the sound of my playlists and podcasts in. The headphones are equally excellent for spoken word and music playback. (Quick hint to iPhone users...go into sound settings and play with the equalizer!) I've been loyal to Shure for the last few years and I have not been disappointed in the products. That said, my headphones get a lot of wear and tear. Lots of folding, wrapping, and pocket stuffing goes on with the headphones in my life. While I try to be careful and use the handy bag Shure headphones come with, the headphones have taken a beating and when tears, shorts, and sound issues have come up, Shure has always stood by their 2 Year Warranty with quick and reliable service, repairs, and replacements. Most recently, the right ear began to short out and some wire became exposed. I filled out the easy online form, sent them in, and within days I had a brand new set of headphones delivered to my door. THAT is service!
I love a company that stands behind their work and their products. Not only are Shure excellent headphones, they are made by an excellent company with customer service in mind.
I'm looking forward to my commute later to inaugurate my latest pair!"
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not ""shure"" if I received a defective product but these earbuds apparently don't have any bass at all. Of course they are monitor headphones and not entertainment boomy earbuds but still when plugged into my computer without an EQ they would sound worse than airplane earphones, only being able to hear mid highs with warm mids and low ends completely muted."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the things, and use them every day. The mids and lows are great, and could not ask for anything better. The highs are mediocre though, as they start to sound tinny at points, really ruining the mood. Also, the soundstage is great, though I have had better. Sound isolation is amazing, and is what really makes this IEM worth it, as it should be. I would definitely recommend them, but if you listen to pop and other high frequency genres, I might look at others."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So satisfied with these headphones. They're a little tricky to get in at first, but once you get the hang of it the performance is excellent. I've used these so far in my friend's studio, playing right next to him drumming and still hearing a good mix in the headphones, and on an airplane filled with crying babies. Once these things make a good seal in your ear, it's just you and your music. A+"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this expecting another one of Shure's high-quality experiences, but ended up very disappointed. Although they headphones were well-made and extremely comfortable, the sound was muddy, unclear, and so base heavy it was hard to actually hear the vocals. Ended up returning these and buying a cheaper but infinitely better sounding pair of Klipsch R6s. The Klipschs have better, punchier base, and manage to do it without loosing the rest of the song."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the SE215-K in Black for the 2012 Christmas Holiday. Very well constructed unit. The earbuds / drivers have a solid construction to them, and the cable is sturdy.

Sound Quality: Excellent
Isolation: Excellent - (Too Good actually, more on this later.)
Price: Reasonable
Intended use: Office work

After using these at the office for the better part of a month, these are great at isolating me from noisy co-workers. When fitted properly the comfort and sound on these monitors are excellent.

Some minor things to note:
The isolation is very good! This can be a downside, as I would not recommend these for people who require situational awareness, such as running.
The if you are not used to earbuds the fit can take some time to get used to.
Make sure you have the correct earbud in the correct ear. It's easy to mix them up, and the fit suffers terribly if you do that."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are solid quality, and some of the best I've owned. Unfortunately they were stolen when my car was broken into, but I will likely buy another pair down the road sometime."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son as I've used E2's, E3's and E5's in my lifetime and knew they are worth the money. The only reason i give them a 4 start and not 5 is because the seam of the plastic rubs the back of the ear because of the size of the earbud making it slightly uncomfortable. Other than that, you get used to it and it's a great sound, and an excellent buy! Enjoy!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great. Very well built. I tried to love these and I still use them, but I can't find peace with the over the ear fit. I also replaced the earbuds with the flange type in an effort to isolate more noise, but the fit was terrible. I've had success with Compfly tips in the past and may try those. Overall these are great, high-quality in-ear headphones, but just not comfortable for me, or easy to use."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is crystal clear and great, we like it.

Update: After a few months of using it, it is still one of the very best. The bass, mid, and upper-range are all crisp and clear to me!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great in ear monitors. It takes a little to get used to with adjusting them in your ears. However after a while it's not a big deal.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for use on my Harley Road King. My wife and I do thousands of miles each year. We both wear 3/4 helmets. I have a Zumo 550 with XM radio and love listening to news and music. I found these earphones, when properly placed in the ear, block much of the road noise and allow listening with a fairly low volume level on the Zumo. They lay flat with the ear level and don't snag when you put your helmet on."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a drummer and I bought these to replace my E2Cs, which lasted a LOT longer. I play with an Aviom personal monitor system and play to backing tracks (accompanying keys, extra guitars, etc.) with a click track and guide voice (to que chorus, verse, etc). One day, the person programming the guide wave made it a little too loud and blew my left ear bud. The right still works fine, so I can't say that it was THAT loud, but since that day, the left side no longer works. I know this because I switched the left and right buds, and the right works on either side, the left bud does not. It started with just static in my left ear and now it's completely silent. This is after 4-5 months of use, much heavier use in the latter 2-3 months.

I went on line to see if I can get a replacement ear bud, and while there's PLENTY of ear tips to go around, there's no replacement buds! So don't be fooled by reviews that state ""easy replacement"" with detachable buds....they're not exactly that easy to find. Shure's website doesn't even have them. Searching ""SE 215 replacement parts"" turns up nothing as well. It's the weekend now and I have to wait until Monday to call Shure b/c their tech support is only open M-F.

*** UPDATE 6/24/2014 ***

I had called Shure 3 days after my last review, and they said to ship the bad ear bud back to them for repair and pointed me to their website where I could get instructions and the form to fill out. It was well under a 2-year warranty, so all I had to pay for was the shipping cost to send it to Shure. They state NOT to send it in a paper envelope, and that they are not responsible for the product until it reaches their facility (understandably). So that meant I had to go to the post office and send it in a padded mailer with tracking, which cost me around $8 US. Shure didn't TELL me to send it with tracking, but the impression I got based on their instructions led me to be safer than sorry. I just received a replacement via UPS this morning. So I've raised my rating one star based on the fast turnaround; while not convenient, it was certainly better than having to purchase a new pair. I would have liked to have been given a shipping label via email or some form of shipping where I didn't have to pay for it. True, $8 is better than $70, but still.

I also raised my rating another star to 4 stars because I realized I didn't rate this product on sound quality and overall use, which are both rather good. During the week I had to use alternative ear buds (a $30 brand bought at an airport kiosk), I realize now how far superior these Shure buds are. The molding sleeve (can't think of any other way to describe it) that rests over the ear is a very nice thing to have along with the slider that allows you to sinch-up the cord to the back of your head and allows for a tight and secure fit."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first you fumble around trying to get the dang thing in your ear, but after you figure it out you appreciate the design. The thick cord material and over the ear design are great at reducing cord sounds from zippers and general movement. They are great for running and working out for that reason. The sound quality is excellent, definitely on the brighter side."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality, great for travel, limits outside sound. Very nice headphones, pleased with the Shure brand."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality, crazy good noise cancelling (almost too good in some situations, if that's even possible). The durability of these little 'phones has also astounded me. I have put mine through the ringer (outdoor work in rain/snow, put through the washer/dryer multiple times) and they just keep on trucking with no issues. The only thing I had to replace was the cord, which was easy since it's detachable. Would absolutely recommend for someone who is looking for fantastic sound quality and durability in a pretty reasonably priced pair of headphones."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Muddy sound. Sounds like a cheap Bluetooth headset with memory foam earbuds. Quality for value does not meet expectations.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding and do a great job of isolating background noise, but are uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. The plastic body presses up against the outside ear cavity and after awhile begins to make ear sore. I ended up purchasing some inexpensive wireless earbuds to replace these."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from 3 year old Shure SCL3's, I already had high hopes of build quality as well as musical quality coming from the SE215's. One thing that initially got to me was the different form factor which does take getting used to (mainly because the SCL3's were simple ""straight into ear canal""). Also it might be because of the shape of my ears or size of ear canal but the seal with these don't seem to be as tight as compared to the SE215's even though I use the yellow foam inserts for both of them.

Lastly, I'm not much of an audiophile but these definitely have much more bass than I'm actually used to but for the genres that I listen to this is more than welcome. The only gripe that I have so far is the type/quality of the carrying case that comes with it. My previous Shure case was a hard case which I appreciated since it kept the foam inserts intact while this one is fairly soft which allows the foam to be compressed (basically defeats the purpose of having the foam inserts if they're already pre-compressed when you take them out)."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely keeps baby cries and subway noises out. Would be great for people who take public transportation or fly a lot. Not very good if you're crossing the street and don't pay attention because you won't hear the honks.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are simply amazing!! A little awkward to get in your ear but once you do the sound is simply wonderful!! Keeps out the sounds around you much better than anything else I have ever tried including the Bose over the ear sound attenuating earphones! I love them! Music is the best!! I can see why the musicians love these things. My new favorite way to listen to music!
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returned. Nothing good about these buds fit is terrible and the sound quality is average at best. Shure went down hill with these
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very comfortable ear buds that have a great sound when they are put on correctly. Thus the rub, putting them in the ear correctly is not an easy task and takes some manipulation. Once on, they have good bass and mid range response and are particularly effective with symphonic and instrumental music. Their sound is a 5 star and their ease of use is a 1 star. However, I have found this positioning in the ear a problem with all ear buds."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Few notable things:
1. One pet peeve of mine is cheap headphones where everyone around you has to listen to what you're playing on your headphones. These Shure's don't have that problem. It has to be ridiculously loud for a person sitting right next to me to even hear a hint of sound. (even in a quiet room)
2. They are not very intuitive in how to place in your ears -- know that there is a semi hard wire that loops over the ear and the earbud swivels into place or just read the directions.
3. These are a lot like wearing earplugs and like earplugs it will pull every little bit of earwax out with them. So, keep your ears clean and it's probably a good idea to have some alcohol wipes to clean them up after use."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There were in deed, sound isolating. Would be ideal in long-use term setting such as on a long flight. However, due to the stiffness of the cable, they are a dickens to put on. Would or could not use these on a daily basis. The sound is quite good once you get them on properly."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play in a church band and these earphones have been perfect for isolating sound. The sound from the earphones creates a sense of space and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Best earphones I've had.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great iems, Good sound quality, clarity, durability(dunked them in some coffee and they still work just fine) etc. They are a tiny bit uncomfortable, as they sit in my ear in such a way to where it's pinching some part of my cavum conchae but I think that has more to do with my having pretty small ears than anything with the iems.

My only gripe is that I got these to game with when I don't feel like wearing my headphones and the sound stage on these isn't very good. In this same price range, gr07 BE serve this purpose for me better."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I tend to be a little forgetful and leave my earphones in my pocket when I come back from work sometimes. I've had these headphones for three years now and they have survived three trips through the washer AND dryer, still functioning perfectly. The hardiness of these headphones alone makes it worth it."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noice cancellation is awesome even inside server rooms. Just have to change the default tip and was perfect. Needed a little time getting used to inserting to my ears.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very good economical professional monitors. Only thing about them is you've gotta make sure you have the correct bud in the correct ear. They will pop right in if they are correct.
If they are on the wrong ear ,you'll have a real hard time getting them in.
But ,their color dot which is really small to see is backwards from the traditional RED is Port side Left and blue is starboard side right. So find someway to label them correctly that you can see with low light."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, if you have odd ears, be prepared for the pain. Fortunately I always have custom fitted ear pieces made, so that issue will go away. Not the highest end earphones, but much better than most of the stuff you get with devices or at Walmart."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a musician, this is one of the best earbuds I've had in a while. For the price, you get great quality sound. When I'm not playing in our praise team at church, I use this on the plane and it works amazing. It produces crisp sound while listening to
My favorite music and the noise cancellation is at par or even better than the more expensive Bose headphones (which I also have). This is a great buy!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love the sound and the comfort. I’ve used them on stage several times now and the clarity and quality is great.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I knew with the Shure name on this product that I wouldn't be disappointed. This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old. It was the only thing he asked for - ""a good pair of earphones"". He loves them. The best part is the spinning ear pieces that engage as you move your head or lean forward so they don't fall out. The sound quality is far superior than any other earphone he's owned. Packaging and accessories are also exceptional quality. He's going to take very good care of these and I suspect will own them for a long time!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best headphones I have ever owned.
Bright highs, robust mids. Full bass.
not exactly ""budget"" headphones. but for the price the quality can not be beat"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sounding for the money. I do not understand those who feel the highs are not there; they certainly are in mine. Bass is strong and overall balance is pretty good. I do not like at all the stiff wire coming out of the body. I have Shure 530's and they are much more comfortable. They do not match my Hi-Fi Man HE-500's, but do a very good job at 1/6 the price."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 4th pair of sure headphones that I have purchased in the last 5 or 6 years. I purchased this set for my son for Christmas. He loves them! I have a pair of SE535's that I use, but these sound GREAT!. Not quite as punchy as mine, but for 100 bucks you can't complain. They are at least as good as my $300 Bose over the ear headphones."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned them as I went with mee audio. For the same price, mee products are much better than Shure. This is from a long time Shure user."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a set of E2C's that lasted for 10+ years but when they finally bit the dust, I knew I would be going back to the Shure product line. The audio is unparalleled and these are a huge improvement comfort-wise over previous models. If these ever breakdown in the future, I'll be looking for the latest and greatest set of Shure earphones to replace them."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound after I started to use the Comply Premium ear buds. The standard buds did not work for me. Bluetooth performance has been very good with no problems.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They aren't primo like the real high dollar ones, but for their price, are excellent. We use them in our band and all of us like them. If you need pro, then these aren't the ones, but for second tier ... pretty fine. I recommend."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit my ears great, I ordered some alternate foam inserts and they feel great, even after prolonged use! Muffles so much outside noise, and provides fantastic sound quality! Very happy with the quality while monitoring a 4-man group and playing :)"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched & tried multiple brands of $100 - 200 priced ear buds (Bose, Sennheiser, etc). After reading a number of reviews on Amazon and other places, I decided to order the Shure SE215's. They are the best! I would even match them up against over-the-ear headphones from Beats & Bose. They provide excellent highs, mids & lows! And the SE215's have an added bonus of being solid noise-canceling headphones."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery was only 6 hours. Communication was not solid and had a brief miss/skip in the audio every now and then. I did not think the fit was very comfortable. I liked the cheaper wired Shure headphones I had from a few years ago better.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, they insulate noise almost as my pair of Bose QC15 which is high praise for such a small footprint in my bag.
Fit is very ok for me, and I personally like the ""over-ear monitor"" type of earphones.

So why such a bad score?
6 months in, and the left unit stopped working constantly.
When it works it's great, but if I move my head even a little bit it stops playing. It's not fun, especially since although they are very good value, they are still not cheap."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh, if you're on the fence on whether to buy these or not, just go with yes, you won't regret it. I've listened to just about every genre with these headphones and all worked out perfectly. The lows come out beautifully, as do the mids and highs, I've never experienced any pair of headphones that had such control over all three. All you have to do is mess around with an equalizer and it sounds perfect, too perfect that I forget i'm wearing them... I've also noticed that I can hear sounds that I've never heard in songs that I've listened to a million times. Only problem is that my standard for earphones is way higher, I can never go back."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy s*** These things are no joke! Buy these. Amazing fit. Godly audio quality and sound and crazy good product. Should cost double. They serve as the best earplugs when u disconnect the cord too!!! Don’t buy skullcandy or beats or anything else but these. Trust me it’s best with DUBSTEP and even better with ACOUSTICS and classic rock. Also does great with ANY GENRE including Bach! Buy these!
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my birthday and I fell in love with them, I attached the white 3 triple sleeves that I bought on a separate order and they worked great. For a drummer there is literally no other earbud for the price thats better. The quality of the sound is great, The noise cancelling is PERFECT. Unfortunately with my stupid actions of carelessness I stepped on one of my nozzles and the tip broke off so I couldn't use one of the earbuds, I thought that was it, a waste of $100. But thanks to Shures AWESOME protective guarantee, Amazon is one of their distributors so I had a 2 year warranty on it! For free! I shipped them out on wednesday and they are coming today on monday!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"but... these are not typical typical earbuds. It takes a few days to get acclimated to their unique shape and fit. The payoff though is great sound. More importantly they excel at blocking out external noise... whether in the office so I can concentrate, in the yard mowing, and yes, on occassion to mute snoring. I highly recommend them - as long as the person knows it takes a bit of time to adjust."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones but because the phones are curved they tangle very easily

***UPDATE*** after a little more than one year of ownership and use, the metal wire inside the cord that forms around my right ear has broken and now does not form around my ear tightly. removed one star. headphones still work fine. I'm probably going to replace them with bluetooth or a different style that does not get all tangled up as easily as these."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Since my old SE215 has been broken after a year of use, I figure maybe it is time for me to try something new, ""the bluetooth connection."" Things were great when I first used it, the product is easy to use and I finally can hear the sound from both of my headphone now (the reason why I changed the old one is because one side won't work anymore, I believe is the wiring problem).
After like two weeks of light usage (approx. 5 hours a week), my left headphone stopped working, and there is only music when my head turns to a certain angle. I knew the wire had broken again.
No objection that Shure can do magic on their headphones, but they don't never heard of Quality Check.
My $100 only works for two weeks, I have no more hope for this company QC, I am so regret that I bought this product."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent pair of earphones, i did a lot of research (weeks) before i decided to buy these. they were the best i could find for the price. the sound quality is excellent. the bass is strong, maybe a bit muddy, but much clearer then comparable earphones, like bose ie or beats. the trebble might be lacking slightly, but the midrange is crystal clear, a real pleasure to listen to. the quality of the build is great too, with a super long wire that is also very durable (kevlar), and an added benefit that is usually reserved for extreme high end earphones, the wire is removable and can be replaced. its also great at keeping out outside noise.
what i did not like was they were not that comfortable and very annoying to get into my ear, required a lot of playing around to get it right. and they hurt my ears after wearing for a while."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not use these for stage performance in live situations but they are perfect for listening to recorded music. However, the only people usually used to this type of in-ear are stage performers. For stage performers used to higher quality dual or triple drivers ears, these will disappoint. For casual listener who is looking for something better than stock ear buds, these will be uncomfortable and take some getting used to. If properly inserted (which is key), they sound very good and are hard to pull out from body movement. Quality of sound and build is much better than the Beats or anything you will buy at a box store."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and perfect for travel. They're small so they pack away nice and block out surrounding sound especially when you put music through them. Skip the microphone option... it's really hard to use these as phone headsets because you can't hear yourself speak and/or know how loud you're talking.

I would recommend for music lovers and people that spend a lot of time in the air!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very detailed, neutral and with the right amount of bass/treble. If you purchase these earphones, keep in mind that sound quality relies the most on how the track was mastered rather than bit rate or audio format; thus, given the honesty of these earphones, you're going to listen exactly what the engineer produced, whether it's crap or a masterpiece. So, make sure to get a well-mastered album and choose the correct sleeve for maximum isolation."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a great overall sound. A bit of a small soundstage compared to some Seinheisser open-back headphones but good for price and size. Not to mention, these survived a trip through the washing machine. Can't really beat that. What made these my top choice over some other headphones and earbuds was their noise isolating. Also they stay in for biking (not recommended, because of noise isolation), and such activities. I still use over ear for home and isolated listening, but these are great for travel. Some people don't like how far they go into their ears. Still highly recommend."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sound quality, about what is to be expected at 100 dollars. Minus one star for the slight discomfort/ cable which is a bit too sturdy for my liking. It is also quite a bit longer for mobile use but I understand that these are IEM's"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, the sound is that different from the bassbuds I owned before. although the bass on these aint that enhanced and heavy compared to my bassbuds which retails for $40, but the bass on these is still very good. the cables are thick, it looks like it would last and I hope so. getting used to wearing these took a while and was a little awkward, but after breaking it in, I have no issues with the fit."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure fan since I bought the SE-210K's that I have used for the last five years. I'm not sure why, but I never had the problems others did with cords fraying and such. I did have problems with corrosion on the metal jacks from my sweat. Also, over time I noticed that I was losing some sound in the left earphone, so I finally decided to upgrade.

The sound that poured from these earphones (the SE-215's) into my ears is AMAZING. I was accustomed to the SE-210 sound and didn't expect too much of a change, just some improvement back to ""baseline"". The music is crisp and clear with great range. I run with these and I had to reset the volume limit on my iPod nano to keep from damaging my hearing. The fit is a bit strange at first...with the SE-210's, I was accustomed to jamming the set into my ear canal as far as possible. The design of these is such that that's impossible, and I was at first concerned that I wasn't going to get a good seal. No problem with that at all, and they stay in place just as expected when doing the hour-long run. They have improved the slider that controls how much play you have with each individual wire to the ear so that it stays in place better than the prior model.

I spent a while debating whether to go with the SE-215's and the next higher model (315's?), but the cost kept me in the 215 range. I have NO regrets whatsoever, at this point, and am totally content with having saved $100 AND getting GREAT sound."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic earbuds! Those that are wanting to buy expensive in-ear monitors should try these first, a quarter of the price and work just as well."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are virtually professional sound quality. The cables disconnect so you can change to iPod specific cable with remote control. Ergonomics fit in the ear and stay in place better than any others. The only downside is that the cables do not come with a clothing clip to keep the cable from swinging during athletic activity. I had to pirate one from an unused earphone cable. 5 stars without this oversight.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, when they work. Bought them in October, by December one of the headphones only works when in my ear at a very specific orientation, which doesn't allow any movement. I was hoping a more expensive pair of earphones would last longer. Would not buy again.

The cord is also a lot longer than I would like. 18"" of cord end up either dangling or being in your pocket."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great but the ear buds are a bit clunky and after wearing them for extended periods, the ears are a bit sore. But all in all, a great product and better than the old design in which you could not unplug the wires from the buds. In the old design, the wires that made a loop around the top of the ears tended to crack and expose the metal wire strands as the wire sheath got older and stiffer. If this happens on the new ones you can just replace the wires."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hard to beat for the price. They deliver nice, full sound. I'm not, however, using the ear buds that came with it, because I really wanted the most noise reduction I could get and these weren't great in that regard. The replacement tips are great, so I now have great sound without going deaf from sitting in front of the drummer. 😉. Would have been a 5-star review with better noise reduction ."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to cut the cord between phone and headset. Tried a couple (well-rated) Bluetooth headsets. None of them came close to the glory that is a pair of SE-535’s.

When I saw this, the benefit of not having to tangle around wires and audio jacks to lightning adapters made it worth a gamble.

I haven’t done extensive a/b testing but initial impressions: no detectable loss of quality, character of sound is similar to hardwired. Even the ear wires are quite friendly to shape around my Obama-like ears comfortably and securely."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these because I didn't want to continue to supply my band members with Shure 535s whenever they broke, stepped on, or otherwise disregarded the value. These are strong for the money - band thinks they sound great, I personally think they sound decent for the money (I use Westone custom ear molded in ears) and would buy again (already did!) to replace their damaged out of warranty units,"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work well...but the over the ear wire always slips off. Also, they are not completely sound isolating. I can still hear outside audio, but it's faint."

I've never heard any of the more high end monitors, but these certainly are worth the price tag.

The fit over the ear is a bit strange, but once you get used to it, they are fine."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this to use as an IEM. I was worried about bass response and how my drums would sound. The plugs that came with are not that great for my ears. I purchased the triple flange sleeves made for SE models which feel great and basically eliminate all other sounds. I have never heard my drums sound so good. Bass drum is huge!!! Im plugged in direct to a stereo out for one of the aux channels. No EQ.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phenomenal earbuds. It took about a week for me to get used to how they felt in my ear, but now I have absolutely nothing negative to say about them. I used to use Etymotic earbuds (for years), which are also great. I find the Shures comparable.

For more depth, the Shures are much more bass-heavy than the Etymotics. One of the great things about the latter is how 'flat' they sound, which is to say that they don't really change how music sounds; they're transparent. The Shures definitely add some bass, but not enough that it detracts from Classical, Jazz, or whatever else. The cable on the Shures is much longer and more durable than the Etymotics. In one sense that makes them bulkier, but they also can take a bunch of abuse.

Overall, I'm really happy with these. They're just different from the Etymotics, but both are great for listening to pretty much whatever genre you're into."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Keep in mind the best earbuds I had before where some Bose I won.. and I could never get them to seal right. With the Shure -- After removing the foam small tips that were to small for me (push from bottom and go around and around while pushing up.. and pull up. The instructions say squeeze and pull.. good luck with that.) I put the medium foam tips on squeezed.. practiced getting them in my ear to form a seal and finally got it. Still with practice I am sure I will be faster with putting them in my ears. Squeeze the foam (if using them) and let them expand in your canal. To check to see if you have a good seal, push slightly on them while playing music, if they sound better when you slightly push, you don't have them in right. Keep practicing. I tried various music: Classic Rock, Pop, Bass, Rock, etc. and I am very pleased with the results. Do a Google search and you will find plenty of tunes to test with (and they will tell you what you should hear and when you should hear it) just be sure if you are listening through YouTube that you pick high quality recordings otherwise you may be going ""whhhhat?"""
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great treble response, extremely detailed, but are a little lacking in the bass unless you insert them so far they touch your brain. Fitment is fantastic... eventually. I spent probably 2 months fiddling with the little form-able wires, trying 4 different ways of wearing the headphones, all which proved to be not quite as good as the normal way. But once you figure out the right way to wear them, and get the wires formed to your ears, they're some extremely comfortable earbuds, and thats from someone who seriously hates earbuds. The flexible wire wraps around your ear and really holds them on while youre doing other activities, though I probably wouldn't take them running, because the connector doesn't look very water/sweat resistant.

They're holding up relatively well after 1.5+ years, which is longer than my earbuds have ever survived during daily use. The 1/8"" jack is incredibly sturdy, and the headphones cords themselves seem to have some sort of metal braided protection in the insulation. However these have developed a minor issue which comes and goes. Something inside the right earbud is rattling, or pinging. It's almost like the little teeny wire inside the clear plastic earbud is being plucked like a guitar string. It happens when I move my head into certain positions, like if I tilt to the right and then back up. Fiddling with it usually makes it go away, or sometimes I just hold my head still, but it is very annoying and might indicate the earbud is about to fail, but if my track record is anything I'll loose them before I hit the 2 year mark."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones so far. I am very very hard on headphones and the cable has lasted me about a year it still works perfectly fine for the most part, but i started to notice a bit of ambient sound in them when nothing was playing so i purchased a new cable and now they are back to normal. Some examples of how hard I am on these I have accidentally ripped them out by the cable by walking past drawers, I have had dogs tear them out of my ears by trying to get into my lap and I have even accidentally washed and dried them"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for a couple months now as a drummer updating from a older set of sures. This was a much needed improvement. Why I waited idk. The price is well worth it. Plenty of good all around tones for your needs, and sound cancellation with the foam pieces are great. Where like other reviews I don't think going up to a 315 or 415 is worth the price as you may as well just go up alot higher to a quad driver. Hard to be disappointed in a set of 215 from sure for musicians. Which that is what these are for. A regular set of headphones will have a better stereo sound then these. Although still good but if you use them for what they are designed for then I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good earbuds. I've had these about 7 months, mostly used at work on constructiom sites. The jack just started cutting out... but this happens to all earbuds/wires over time and overall the cord is pretty tough. The nice thing is you can unclip the buds and just buy a new cord or even upgrade it.

I also wash them the other day(ahhh!). But after a little jinkiness they seem to be workin ok still.(other than the cord jack cutting out). Best toughest earbuds I've found so far and worth the money IMO.

One last thing, if you're not used to having the earbuds that wrap over your ear they might seem uncomfortable at first. I felt this, but got used to them pretty quick.

*Lost my first pair after over a year of solid use and even a couple washes. Ordered a second pair and the left bud was faulty, so I simply unplugged the bud and mailed it back for replacement which was very fast. Thanks again.

**Two months of use on this new pair and the bud that was replaced simply fell apart on me. Pretty disapointed, these should last quite a bit longer. My first set did, but 2 crapped buds in a row is pretty bad."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My experience with Shure SE215-K and the Bose IE2

I have owned the Bose IE2 earphones for over 2 years and had them replaced twice. The bose earphones are okay but after 6+ months they start to wear very fast. The wire had wear and tear 8 months in from purchase date (authorized dealer) and I had to have them warrantied.
I still own them but decided to buy new earphones because the quality on the earphones started to die out and then wire got really bad again. This time I was out of luck cause the warranty period ended 9 months ago. I used the Bose IE2 daily and it served its purpose. Back then, I was suckered in by Bose advertising and got their product. After looking at many online reviews, I started to wonder if Bose really lived up to their name and quality. So that's when I started to look at new earphones to buy and landed me here.

Please note warranty periods: Bose - 1 Year VS Shure SE215 - 2 Year. To have a valid warranty make sure you buy directly from Amazon.com LLC. If not, you risk buying a non-authorized one without warranty.
After reading many reviews and thinking about the price ($100), I have decided to go with these(Shure SE215-K).

When I received the product, I was happy to un-box them and compare them to my Bose IE2 earphones. At first, it took some getting used putting them in my ear but I figured it out within 5 minutes. I plugged them into my phone ( Samsung Galaxy S4 ) and started to test out multiple songs. Surprisingly the bass was a lot better than Bose and WAY MORE sound isolation. I had another person compare them and they came up with the same conclusion. They are not super earphones like the 400$+ ones but they do get the job done if your looking for decent earphones.

The only DOWNSIDE to this product, in my opinion, is the shape of the wire around the ear. If the wire was just straight down like other brands, I would absolutely love it. This may be one factor to which you may not like the product so please consider that before buying. I am still getting used to the shape around the ear but I believe over time I will conform to it.

Also a huge plus to this product is the detachable wire. If you ever rip the wire due to accident or any other reason, you can just buy another wire on Amazon near $20-$30. So after your warranty period ends and an accident happens, you can be sure to stay in the okay. Unlike Bose IE2, which are totally useless now due to my wire accident."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great. Solid noise dampening, strong sound. The Bluetooth is a little lacking but not terrible. Sometimes I get dropouts even when it's just in my left pocket vs right. (I'm guessing the bt module is in the mic / control part of the cord.)

I know it can be an issue with any device if there is interference in the air, but for a cable that typically sells for $100 on it's own, I expected better performance.

Still, I love the headphones enough to put up with it.

You can still swap them out too for a regular or headset style cord (like for watching movies on an airline's in-seat monitors, or connecting to a device with no wireless."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing! I purchased my first set of Shure earbuds several years ago at Best Buy. When I finally wore them out, I couldn't find a replacement set. I tried Bose, Beats, JayBird (blue tooth), and several other less expensive sets. When I found these on Amazon, I bought a set a month ago. A few mornings ago while preparing to go on a run, I stepped on an earbud and crushed it! I immediately visited Amazon and bought another pair.

The great thing about these is the fit. They fit perfectly into my ears and do not slip. I recently completed a marathon and used my Shure all 26.2 miles. They stayed in my ears and were comfy/cozy the whole way!

Thanks, Shure, for making such a great product and for making it available on Amazon!!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as a replacement for the cord on my 425s. They have good sound quality and basic features; the buttons work as expected. On an iPhone 8+, Bluetooth stays connected reliably, but there are intermittent skips in music, especially when first connecting or reconnecting. The skips are particularly jarring for in-ear type headphones because a skip is pure silence. I expected more from Shure, especially given their experience with wireless technology. Finally, the verbal communication about being ""connected"" is informative and they tell you how much battery life you have left. Unfortunately, the sound quality of these notifications are extremely low. It sounds like a nice lady talking through a muffled landline directly into your ear. Again, I expected more from a $100 accessory to already very pricey headphones.

Ergonomically, the little battery pack nugget isn't too heavy; I have it hanging below my chin when at a desk and barely notice it. When out and about I have it rest behind my head on my neck. In this configuration, the nugget falls to one side and puts a little pressure on the other ear. Not a big deal, and kind of expected. Shure includes a little clip that you can use to combat this but it seems a little hackey.

Overall, this is a good way to keep Shure headphones connected in a world without headphone jacks, but unfortunately the quality of the electronics isn't up to par with the headphones they pair with."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace an old set of Shure earbuds. They are more comfortable to wear, and easier to put in my ears because the tips rotate. I've been a big music lover most of my life, and this is the best experience. Hook them up to a SanDisk Clip Zip and it sounds like the orchestra is inside your head. Great for shutting out the noise when flying."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I upgraded to decent headphones a few years back. I found Shure and that's the brand I stick with. I use them all the time. I travel a lot and wear them constantly while on planes, I use them in the workshop in lieu of earplugs, and I wear them while mowing the lawn. They sound very nice, I can't proclaim how nice as I don't feel qualified to compare them with an audiophile's vocabulary but they are exponentially better than what you get with any device. I also upgraded them with the phone accessory and use them for phone calls all the time. Much better than a wireless bluetooth headset...don't run out of batteries either.

That all being said, I have had issues in the past with the sheath over the wires cracking and splitting after a time. This new design, with the earphones being separate, seemed like a great idea. When the cords get mangled or fall apart, get new ones. So, the cord got mangled and I ordered a new one. Removing the earphones and putting them on the new cord, something broke in one of the earphones. Not sure what I did wrong but back to Shure for repair. They replaced it under warranty (they have great service) but still a bit of a hassle.

They are great earphones and I recommend them. But, if you use them as heavily as I do, recognize they will not last forever and you will need to replace them on a periodic basic. This is the primary reason I have avoided any of their higher priced earphones. I would be really upset to have to replace a $400 pair every year (or less)."

Compared to others I have tried at this price point, they are wonderful. The over-the-hear fit doesn't bother me because the earphones are supported by the seal in the ear canal, not by the cable. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound quality at a low price or seeking a portable option for when big cans aren't feasible."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off there's so many reviews on these I didn't think I'd write one, but I felt I have something to highlight. This is my use of them, my content and source. I have an Fiio X3 DAP and listen to lossless flack CD rips. I bought all of this for incentive to get to the gym, receiving them about 4-5 weeks ago. I can say that out of the box I really wasn't all too happy. When first them, as it has been mentioned over and over in many reviews, the bass was very lacking and I found them to be quite harsh maybe around 4K or so. I fiddled with the EQ on the Fiio endlessly and just managed to feel they were OK at best. However, for my use at the gym they worked extremely well, in terms of staying in my ears. I really like the fact that the cords are over your ears, allowing the cord to get a pretty good tug without pulling them out. I'm using the large soft inserts and they are very comfortable. So, I've been using them 4 days a week about 2 hours on those days, plus I let them play 2 days solid when I got them, now there has been just an insane transformation after all that usage. I'm experienced with high end audio and know break-in is important and thought 2 days of solid play when I first got them would do, but it just wasn't enough time. I am now very very impressed, with overall sound quality, bass response, clarity in the highs and mids, and now have turned my EQ off on my Fiio. What I can say, and what should be very obvious, if the music is recorded well, the bass if fantastic, it's very tight and deep. The vocals are simply outstanding and there's lots of detail in the mids and highs. If I'm listening to just general rock when I'm working out, yes there's not much bass. IF IT'S NOT RECORDED THAT WAY nor would there be bass when I listen to those same tracks on some of my other equipment. In contrast if I listen Maroon 5 or Allen Stone, there are tracks that I just have to turn down the volume because there is so much bass, again no EQ. For pleasure I listen to a lot of jazz, with vocals and without and these live up to and exceed what I thought they might. For most of this listening I'm attracted to music that has high sound quality, artists like Dianna Krall, Norah Jones, Fourplay, Joe Sample, Bob James, ect. With well made recordings like these, the headphones are very invisible, and I tend to feel very immersed in the music and forget I'm wearing them. The vocals are centered and they have a very open and airy sound stage. They give a definite feel of the ambiance in which the recording was made especially in the vocals and back up singers. Piano and acoustic guitar's sound very accurate and equal to my impression of the vocals.

So bottom line IMO is, don't pay attention to reviewer's that listened to them right out of the box or with little play time and thought they were less than they really are. And most of all don't expect that they'll be more than the quality of the recordings you have and the equipment your playing them on. If you're listening to 128kbps files on your ipod, you won't come close to hearing the full potential of what these can offer. Just buy something cheaper."

9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not great. They're probably great for the money, though. I previously had the Shure iem's equivalent to these ( I forget the model #), and loved them. These iem's are good, however I can't get them in my ears really solidly. Maybe it's just my ears, but I think it's because the main mechanism part turns toward the rear too closely to the part that goes in the ear. In other words, the part going into the ear is too short. And since they aren't quite in 100% (I don't think), it cuts down on the sound I'm hearing, the low end especially. I've tried switching to smaller buds, which helped some, but I don't quite feel like they're ""mine"" yet. One more thing. I had custom ear molds made for the other Shures I had, and since the design changed, they're useless. Oh, well. They work, and they sound good. Not bad

I would say they could use a bit more bass, but overall they are great and I still give them a 5 out of 5.

They have ample bass, and mids and highs that are just right. The foam eartips are airtight as well. I can't hear diddle with them in, which I like but some may not. It also includes silicone tips, which I would imagine would be a little less air tight, but I haven't tried them yet. The cable is solid and feels like it should endure the inevitable tugs and pulls that all cord will experience.

(As a reference, I am an audio engineer who covers tracking, mixing, and mastering and have been known as very anal about audio quality.)

My entire purpose in buying these headphones was to act as a reference for tracking/mixing/mastering, allowing me to focus on details when needed, and to provide another method of testing mixes in real world environments.

The build quality of these headphones is very nice and the ability to disconnect the buds is fantastic. However, the sound quality is downright pathetic, especially when compared to other offerings in this price range. While the bass response is solid, the mids are undefined, the high mids are incredibly harsh, and the highs are seemingly swallowed up by the high mids. If you are looking for ear fatigue and a complete mess of the soundstage above 1khz, then these are your earphones. For the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would claim these earphones have a good sound for they absolutely do not, even for this price range.

For reference, the Polk Audio Nue Era in ears are a very nice sounding option in the sub $100 price range. Unfortunately out of the three sets I have owned and enjoyed in the last two years, all three have had the left earbud completely fail causing me to abandon them as a reliable option...hence why I was trying the Shure's. I have now purchased the Thinksound Rain2's and hope to have more success there."

They stay put in your ears
The sound isolation is great
The sound is very clear overall and it's easy to distinguish individual sounds in music

Cons:
The tone is heavily weighted toward the mid bass with very little low bass representation (this is actually not bad in noisy environments
Can be a little uncomfortable after a few hours depending on your ear shape"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. I wasn't sure how much of a difference these would make with my cell phone, but it's like light and day compared to the stock headphones. The attention to quality is very impressive as well, the cable lining makes it very flexible without getting stuck in a bent shape. Even more impressive is how they don't tangle while in the case."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the sound from these in-ear headphones, though I will say the bass could be sharper. I also couldn't change earpieces based on the instructions provided. Some more descriptive tips on how to seat these in the ear properly would also have been appreciated. They sit in your ear kind of like a hearing aid, with the cord running vertically up the front of the ear, then looping behind the ear and back down. It takes me a while to get them seated properly, though I hope I'll get better at it in time. Once I do get them properly in place, the cords that should wrap neatly around my ear end up sticking too far up and out, looking ridiculous and feeling a bit awkward. All that said, I still give them four stars because, for in-hear headphones, these to sound pretty darned good."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,love these. for under the helmet they are comfortable and sound great and clear. great for keeping the wind noise out. But I can still hear enough with them on.

So far they are just what I expected. Highly recommend them."

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Earphones themselves seem to be great, yet the pair that I received appears to be defective. The right earbud cuts out depending on wire angle which I was hoping to avoid with these, but sadly I can't escape this issue still. I'll be sending these back under their limited warranty, and will update the review with the new earphones and the experience with their return service. As of this review I would not recommend them."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipped super fast! Got it next day. Love the sound quality . Not happy that it is not hands free enabled for cell phones or the awkward around the ear thing they added. I understand it is so the cables do not fray quickly but it slows me down when I just want to pop ear phones in my ear. Wish I got to try it on before I bought it.

I do miss the normal Shure 115 M+/"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly dissapointed in lack of design attention to cable. I was excited to order these as I've owned SE215s. I intended to use them for running but found that the cable design is hideous for any activity or movement in general. It hangs long and the battery compartment is heavy. The inline mic control is quite far from your ear. In addition, the drivers don't magnet together or provide other extras you can find in much cheaper alternatives. I ordered these even after seeing other reviews of the cable being too long, foolish decision."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great single driver inner ear monitors. I use them for riding and working out. This is my third pair of shures and I will keep on collecting them as needed.

My other two pair are the se210 and se310. My se210 were chewed up by my new pup, so the se215 are replacing them. The se310 are for long trips, studying, and work projects.

Sound quality is excellent for the price and the replaceable cables will be an awesome plus if I leave my iem's out on the coffee table again."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned these after trying to love them for a week. Bottom line is that, for me, they are uncomfortable and difficult to get in and out of your ears. I was unable to listen for more than an hour or two at a time because they began to make my ears hurt.

What might have been a saving grace--great sound--was in fact very underwhelming for me. I must make clear that I am no audiophile, so if you are one perhaps it's best to disregard my opinion on the sound quality. Perhaps I missed out on some fantastic subtleties that have earned these headphones great reviews. But as an everyday lover of music who hasn't before experimented with higher quality sound equipment, these headphones sounded no better than the standard $20 pair of Sony earbuds I typically use. I'm sure that will sound like sacrilege to a lot of people who know what makes ""good"" and ""bad"" sound, but again for an average guy these things aren't likely to blow your mind with their sound.

What I can compliment about these headphones is that they seem wonderfully durable and well-constructed. Take this with a grain of salt, as I'm judging basing on handling the headphones for a week rather than seeing how they actually held up over months or years. The cables are thick and the earpieces feel like strong, durable plastic. This is something that definitely cannot be said about a $20 pair. Even if these headphones don't sound noticeably better to me than a cheap pair, I can imagine having to replace the latter five times or more in the duration that the Shures would have lasted me, thus justifying the cost.

In any case, I plan to continue searching for headphones that are not only durable but also comfortable and sonically impressive. I was able to return these after a week with no issue, so if you want to try these out to decide for yourself if they're the right pair for you, there's not much to lose!"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than my Bose, Beats, high end Sony and JBL. I even have some Sennheisers that still aren't as good as these. Next I'll have to get some Shure dual drivers."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds is very good. I use for riding long long trips on motorcycle. Slim fit is perfect for not creating road noise and with foam tips it blocks traffic just enough to hear only honking horns and sirens. I have now sent for chord that has mic included and hope it works as well as this one.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compact and cancel noises fairly decently when wearing them per instruction. Recommended by a friend who said this brand is a bargain compared to other brands out there.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was incredible but after 3 mos 1 side quit working. My husband was anal about taking care of them too.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little skeptical about these particular head sets because I have read so many negative reviews. So I decided to pull the trigger and get a pair and man was I surpirsed they sound great right out of the box. I have had a chance to buy MUCH more expensive ones but don't waste your money this model is perfect for everyday use. I have a friend who is a church musician and he recommended these. I am very happy with my purchase and will upgrade when the chance arises.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, and I like that the earbuds are separate from the wires. Shure has good customer service too - my left driver suddenly died on me after about 2 months of use, and they sent a new one out to me (along with more ear bud pieces and another case) in a timely manner."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, really love these headphones. For $100, these are a steal.
As a casual listener of music, who appreciates a nice thump to the bass, these headphones have everything I wanted. The bass is present but not overpowering, details are clear, and the fit is soft. The stock tips that the phones come with the most comfortable tip an IEM has ever came with.
The cable is nice, however after some months, the plastic part that wraps around the ear snapped in the left side. Sound still plays and there are no detriments to sound quality, however I worry that it might malfunction and paying for a replacement cable is a bit too much at the moment."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, and they lie deep enough in my ear so that I can wear them in my Shoei RF-1100 comfortably. Highly recommended."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned the first one because the Bluetooth wouldn't stay connected to any of my devices.
The replacement was better but it took too many steps to switch from phone to laptop.
I returned it and bought a plug in cable"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"they sounded fine, but the shape made it difficult to get the foam or rubber inserts far enough in my ear to get a decent seal to block out other noise. The cord is also too stiff to wrap around my ears well, so they just drift all over."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, although I'm used to a smaller earbud like the klipsch earbuds. These are quite large! You wear them in your ear like the picture displays. You also must loop the wire around your ear or the wire just kind of hangs awkwardly. Definitely not a fashion statement but the sound is stellar. They also ship with memory foam tips which is a plus.

I use them while riding my motorcycle so the fit is a little snug but its not too bad. Cord is longer than usual, with a 90 degree bend at the 9mm jack, and thicker than most headphone cords. Not cons but things to just get used to."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile, but I've started buying and using headphones from different companies like JLab, Ultimate Ears, and Shure. These are far and away the best earbuds I've ever owned in my life. The sound quality is perfectly balanced, the noise isolation is amazing, the cord doesn't tangle or break, the fit is the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and they don't leak sound. Replaceable chord and earbuds are just icing on the cake.

If you aren't sure about whether or not to buy these, I promise that you will not be disappointed."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing! The sound is great. The noise cancelling ability is phenomenal. I didn't hear any engine noise on my plane rides. And they're far more comfortable than the typical ear buds that come with Apple products.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned a pair of Shure headphones a few years ago but the cord has ripped and I have been using other pairs that came with my ipod or a pair of Skullcandys. I remember my old ones and I was looking forward to getting these, they were a christmas gift.

I have no complaints except that maybe they could be a little louder, but then I may just go deaf so it may not be a bad thing they dont go louder.

Overall excellent noise reduction you cant hear nothing when you have these on. The sound stays clear even when all the way turned up. Cord can be replaced if it ever rips, a huge plus for me as i have seen many headphones come and go but thanks to these Shure's the cord can just be replaced. As you wear them in they get more comfortable and you will enjoy them once you find the right fit for yourself.

So if your in the market for a great pair of headphones these are a great pair to consider"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these things are absolutely phenomenal. These had to be handcrafted by little elves whom excel at producing high quality earphones and sound. It's as if god himself created these. $99 for these? You have to be dumb to pass up on them."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior sound and very comforatable! well worth the money
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for two main reasons: to have good monitors for stage and studio use, as regular ear phones tend to fall out while playing drums. My other reason was to own a good quality and durable set of earphones. These earphones do just that! The interchangeable cable allows me to simply buy a new cable instead of a whole new set, if the cable fails. The design is very good as well. These never, ever fall out of my ears. The audio quality is pretty much perfect. Very crisp high end and a very well-rounded low end. Seems to accurately render my music. The noise cancelling is amazing for flights. Purchase these and you WILL NOT be disappointed. Plus, you get to look cool with clear monitors coming out of the back of your shirt into your ears ;)"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't normally write reviews of products, but I have to say that these are the best headphones I have ever purchased. I don't know if my ears are just shaped differently, but every other pair of headphones I purchased would fall out while I was working out. I have never had an issues with these headphones falling out. I highly recommend watching the Shure video on how to properly wear them in the ear. I also recommend wearing them so the wire goes behind your ears and down your back. That minimizes any noise from the cord rubbing on your clothes. Well worth the price I paid ($99.00)."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is tough for me to get these buggers to stay in. The stiffer part of the cord near the earpieces is meant to be bent into a form, but mine likes to wriggle around a bit like a fish. The result is that I am constantly adjusting them with my hand or shoulder-nudging them when I am running.

I also don't like the biggish knobby plug-in. It's too big for my phone case to accept, so now I have my phone without its case. First world problems ... I know.

Sound quality is fantastic, however. As an audiophile, that really is my major criterion."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit strange to wear at first, but once I got the hang of it, they are decently comfortable and offer good sound quality."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my second pair of earbuds after years of relying on headphones. I bought them to replace my Klipsch X4i which developed a short circuit just a bit more than a year after I bought them (and, natch, just past the end of the warranty period).

Background:

I am not an audiophile. I dislike heavy bass music. Indeed, I dislike loud music of any kind. I use earbuds/headphones primarily to listen to the radio and mp3 files while walking (of which I do a lot, in quiet neighborhoods and busy city centers). I neither run nor do any other kind of exercise with them.

That said:

1. SOUND QUALITY

I do notice a difference in sound quality between these and the Klipsch X4i. I think it is richer, but audio performance is so subjective, individuals have such different wishes, that's about all I can say.

2. COMFORT/FIT

It took me a couple of hours to figure out how to use my first earbuds (Klipsch X4i) and get comfortable taking them in and out.

I spent probably close to 12 hours over several days trying to get the Shure to not only fit, but fit comfortably, and I still can't put them ""on and off"" as quickly or as easily as I can the Klipsch X4i.

You can see from the image that these earbuds are both bigger than ordinary earbuds and shaped differently. I assume the engineers figured that the shape/size combination would help seal off outside noise more effectively by putting a bigger barrier in the outer ear. Unfortunately, I suspect that they must have tested the design on men with ears of a certain size. I have to tug and pull and twist all parts of my ear to try and get these to fit snugly. And when I got them to fit ""properly"" in my outer ear, the inner part, the part that extends into the ear canal with the eartips, never, ever quite get ""in"". I could get the inside more or less plugged up only by letting the exterior body of the earbuds sort of stick outwards from my ear.

These earbuds are, not unexpectedly, also heavier than my previous earbuds and not pleasantly so. I switched from headphones to earbuds precisely because I found the pressure of the former uncomfortable. On a short walk, this doesn't matter so much. At first, they are a bit uncomfortable. Then I get used to them. But on longer walks, the discomfort returns and I pretty much can't wait to get home and take them out.

3. NOISE ISOLATION

With the supplied eartips, noise isolation was close to zero. I tried them all. I even tried making my own out of standard earplugs (there's a lifehacker video showing how to do this: http://lifehacker.com/5347245/make-comfortable-noise-isolating-earbuds-for-less-than-a-dollar). I did once, for a few minutes, manage to get a good seal in my left ear but I haven't been able to reproduce it. No doubt, with enough time and effort I might.

Then I discovered ""pluggerz - music"" in a Walgreens (in the section with various kinds of earplugs). These are the standard triple-flanged earplugs one can usually buy to block noise, but they are designed for use with earbuds. I've never liked this style much; I prefer the softer, rounded foam earplugs. $10 for two, but I was getting desperate.

They were easy to attach to the Shure and almost immediately gave me incredible noise isolation. I still can't get the body of the earbud to fit snugly in my outer ear, but other than its probably looking peculiar, it doesn't affect the noise isolation.

Others have mentioned the background ""noise"", the sound of the cables, while using these earbuds. With the supplied eartips, which provided almost no noise isolation, I didn't notice this. With the pluggerz, I do. In short, there seems to be a trade-off between hearing a certain amount of outside (traffic, etc.) noise but nothing else and hearing little or no outside noise but having this kind of hum/white noise/cable movement in the background.

CONCLUSION

I plan to replace these with a more conventional style of earbuds as soon as I can afford to do so. The pluggerz give me good noise isolation, and the audio is really quite good with the Shure, but they are simply way too uncomfortable for extended use - for me."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is perfect but bass could have been made more richer. The downside of this headphone is just the design. The wire is too long and hard to manage. Other than that, everything is just perfect. I'll be waiting for a next iteration of this headphone."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are my first pair of ""good"" earbuds. before purchasing these I had always just bought skullcandy or similar earbuds. After 3 pairs of those had broken within 6 months of purchasing I decided to man up and buy some nice earbuds. These have fantastic sound quality, you can feel the bass, and all the way up the spectrum they sound fantastic. The one issue I have found with them is the noise isolation. My gripe may be good to some people though. I feel like at times the isolation is too extreme. As an example of the extremes of the isolation I was once sitting in my room listening to music on these and someone knocked on the door and called my name and I heard nothing. This can be great for when I'm riding the bus and I want some peace, but it can be a bit too much at times. But for the price you can't go wrong with these. If you want earbuds in this price range with equal sound quality that don't have the insane isolation that these have you should try the klipsch image s4."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums, and these earphones are very good for the job. No complaints. They fit tightly in the ear and are comfortable, stay in place no matter how you move... A very good purchase!!! And, I forgot, great sound!!!"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give these a 5 star but I found the highs/treble to be a touch too crackly/tinny for my taste with a flat EQ. Again, this is my taste. Others find the highs to be just fine. The treble reducer EQ preset on my iPod resolves this issue. Mids and bass are very present and are produced very clean and clear. Bass is not muddy or overpowering, although it can be overpowering without being muddy via an EQ tweak if so desired (bass heads will not be disappointed). A friend of mine has these and insists the highs sound better with the treble booster iPod EQ preset. I couldn't disagree more. We both agree the sound they produce is fantastic and fun. He has the black translucent set. I opted for the clear ones over black due to some reviews on head-fi suggesting the cable being slightly more stout. Also, they look interesting. Being able to see the single dynamic driver through the case is nice. But bottom line, the color choice was not terribly important to me.

My primary use for these is while working out - cardio and weight training. In the 1&1/2 weeks I have been using them I can say they handle my abuse at the gym very well. I generally am rough with my gym equipment, earphones included. Although I take very good care of my things, I do not baby them. They did not fall out of my ears in any of my exercises regardless of me being sweaty. They remained sealed in my ear canal very well at all times. I found that maintaining a good seal in the ear canal is key to achieving the best sound reproduction as well as sound isolation. Experiment with the 2 different types of tips(foam and silicone) in 3 different sizes(S,M,L) that are included. The foam tips are similar to the industrial style ones used in noisy environments such as job sites, power plants, fabrication shops and shooting ranges for actual hearing protection.

I used the large foam tips that are included for best sound isolation. Although, medium foams fit ok too. I consider them my spare set. I did not try the silicone tips or 'olives' yet. I did not find the cord to be too long. I keep my iPod in my front pocket and the cord is a good length for me. The 3.5mm jack on these is on the larger side but did fit in my iPhone with Otterbox Defender case. In general i found the kevlar cord to be very well made and sturdy. Also, if the cord is damaged it alone can be replaced by un-snapping it from both canal-phones. The 'memory wire' that is used to keep the wire molded behind your ear can be a bit tricky to manipulate at first. Placing them into your ears can prove equally as tricky. However, with a little practice you will get used to it. Once they are in they fit my ears as if they were custom molded. I found the build quality on the canal-phones to be equally sturdy and well made. I suggest going to Shure's website [...] for details.

I would recommend to anybody. Especially with a strict spending limit of $100 as I had. They offer great bang-for-your-buck sound, fit, build quality, looks and 2 year warranty with customer service ratings to back it. In this price range I don't think one could do any better."

1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the way these Shure SE215-K fit. The cord is the thick Shure cable. I prefer the older style SE210 which fit and work wonderfully. I could also buy a replacement extension for the SE210 cable which lasted longer than the original from Shure and for very cheap. I don't see an inexpensive replacement cable for the SE215, but I won't be wearing them as much since I don't like they way they fit, so I guess the Shure cable will last longer this time."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a trained classical and jazz musician who went looking for great fidelity in a budget price. Outstanding sound on these. Learning curve to inserting and wearing however. Excellent spectrum of frequencies. Excellent comfort with the foam tips.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sounded wonderful while they were working. I have had previous generations of Shure earbuds which I preferred, a little more even in response (and didn't give up the ghost so easily). These are a little bass-heavy for me, but plenty of people love that about them. I have tried many different sets of earbuds in the 100-150 dollar range and, in terms of sound, Shure is really as good as it gets ...

Problem is, the left side started cutting out after using them moderately for LESS THAN A WEEK. Cable issues, as several here have noted. Returned. A broken product is a broken product. I would normally give 1 star, but must give 2 because they do sound great."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased dozens of earphones and earbuds for under $100 over the years. (I reserve the big bucks for speakers and electronics.) Starting with Koss and Superex headphones, I've ended up happy with Grado's. But up until recently it's been harder to find earbuds that are wearable, great-sounding, AND that I could afford to lose at the gym or on vacation. So my wife and I have been using some version of Sony's MDR-EX series for years now, and been satisfied with them. But with quality earbuds finally catching on, there are a lot more brands and models to choose from. So with the destruction of my last set of earbuds and the arrival of the value-priced Shure SE215, it was time to give Shure a try.

Thankfully, there were no nasty surprises. In fact, I think the reviews are pretty accurate overall. Thankfully I've had no problem with intermittent connections at the earpiece as reported by a couple of reviewers.

The SE215 earbuds are quality made, and appear quite rugged. Hopefully they'll last for many years, at least as long as the much cheaper Sony's have. The selection of rubber and foam earpiece ""sleeves"" provide a good range of fit to choose from. I expected to prefer the foam, which does fit easily and snugly, with excellent sound isolation. But perhaps a little too snugly for me, resulting in long term fit-fatigue. I'm trying out the standard rubber sleeves now; so far so good.

The way these fit over and in the ears is unusual, but very effective. They retain their place AND seal even when moving around or exercising. They take 2-3 times longer to insert in your ears than standard earbuds, so don't purchase these if you have to remove your earbuds often for any reason. Since the cable goes over the ear, cable noise is very low, but not completely gone.

Sound quality is very important to me. I want the best of both worlds; realistic, natural sound AND knock-my-socks-off ""great-sounding"" performance. Usually you can't have both in one product, especially transducers. What the SE215's provide is more of the former; a mostly flat response with no people-pleasing-peaks. As a result, your emotional and/or intellectual involvement will be wholly dependent on the music and production values. This is as it should be anyway.

As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no lack of bass. It is quite solid, with plenty of kick when called for, but without bloat. I wouldn't recommend them as ""bass-lover"" models; they just aren't bass-shy. Male vocals can be a little warm, but not unpleasantly so. Mid-range is natural and clear, just like I want it.

Due to a slight hearing loss I am not a great judge of high-frequencies. But to me these sound a little rolled-off in the region I CAN hear. This was easily corrected by a slight amount of EQ above 6KHz. (It may also be that I've become accustomed to earbuds with too much high end!)

I am especially gratified to know that an American company like Shure has survived from 1925 well into the digital age. Shure is still making fine products at reasonable prices. There is just no way to avoid those analog transducers, right?"
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are worth every penny. i have no idea how they don't come up as being one of, if not the best for around $100.

I'm just annoyed because instead of listening to my music, I spend the entire time attempting to keep the earbuds in my ears. Right now I'm sitting in a library trying to get some work done, but I'm spending the time trying to keep these stupid things in my ears. I guess I'll have to do without music. So far it's seems like these were a waste of $100. I think I might try to sell them and shop around for another nice pair of earbuds. I have some nice can headphones for home, but I want a nice pair of earbuds for when I'm out and about. Does anyone have any suggestions for about the same price?"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the headphones. They became my favorite brand quickly. I used them for everything from running to biking. I loved them but I ended up breaking them and I didn't get a response from the product seller if I could get another one. If they accepted the warranty I had for it, my rating would be 5."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old pair of Shure E2C's for about 8 years, and they just wore out. I always treat my headphones well, and case them between each use, so I don't mind spending a fair amount of money on hem. I ordered the SE-215K's because the I couldn't find the E2C's anymore. These fit great, and have fantastic sound. I hadn't used hem much until recently, but started wearing them every day at the gym a couple of months ago. Today, the left side stopped working. I expect a lot more from a $100 pair of earphones."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely stunning audio, I've heard parts of songs I haven't even heard of before. However the fit is something I still have yet to get used to. Overall:
Pros
-great bass
-great overall sound quality
-amazing noise cancelling
-incredibly durable
-good warranty
-detachable earphone from wire
-lots of tip choices
Cons
-hard to fit

-no mic or sound adjustment on wire"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on these things are great. It's even and balanced, and it shines on albums with organic instruments.

The fitting of these earphones is questionable though. If I put them snugly in my ear canals they'll start to hurt after a while. The solution is to leave them a bit less snug, and everything is okay."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love 'em. They are a total hassle to stuff into my ears compared to any other earphone/headphone. However, once they are in there, geez the sound is so sweet. And these things, with the foam tips attached, isolate sound like no other. They definitely have improved as they've been broken in. If these ever break, I'm buying them again."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic monitors. They are a little high maintenance in terms of how to wear them. They sit best if the cord runs out and down your back. So no quick in and out, but once they are in place you are good to go. The isolation is really really good. The sound is fantastic if the fit is good. There is literally a sweet spot where if they are fully in your ear and seal well, the bass comes alive. Unbelievable that they are only $99. Very happy with my purchase, highly recommended if you are patient with getting the fit right."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is amazing! very nice base and crisp sound.Probably the best I have ever had.Yet I might add, it is a hassle to put it on properly. It is not done like a regular in-ear plug-ins. You need to practice!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound fantastic. There are six different sizes of ear pieces, 3 foam, 3 rubber. I personally use the foam because it feels like an earplug that fits perfectly, drowning out ambient sound. My drummer can now be perfectly mixed in my monitor. Same for the singers and other instruments. There is definitely a learning curve to getting the perfect fit because the cord can be wrapped behind the ear, but once you get it, no one will ever know they're in there."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that good earphones were worth the money, until I tried these ones. I actually first bought a pair of the old version of these earphones, they lasted me for 4-5 years. Now I get to re enjoy them in their format. The earphones disconnect themselves from the main cable, which is great because that is what normally fails first (as was the case for my old pair). Now, right next to the earphones the cables are semi rigid, in order to offer support on the ear, I still find this a bit uncomfortable as it is something new and unexpected, but can't complain at all. You will never listen to your music the same way."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These puppies are solid across the board. I'd prefer sone punchier bass, but as far as isolation goes, I don't now of an IEM that can come close. If you're looking for a smooth pair of IEM's that isolate REALLY well, you found em. The sound stage is also broad and well filled, even for non bass heads. The fit might be unconventionalat first, and over time the cord will curl in really frustrating ways, but it's nothing serious, and you can get used to it all.

I highly recommend em."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great for noise isolation. I use them while on the bus and they allow me to listen to my music at a low volume and not needing to have it at full blast to listen like with other headphones. Also they don't make any cable noise for when working out. The only thing to watch out for is that they may be way too isolating to the point where I miss conversations behind my back or people trying to get my attention. Overall I reall recommend this product for anyone looking for a great pair of headphones. One small thing to watch out for is the strange way to put them in place on your ears since it is a bit ackward at first
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great set BUT..... after 2 years I had to replace the cable cause it went bad. Replaced it with the Shure EAC46CLS for $34.99 from Amazon.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for the 3 sets that I drummed in. Left ear shorted after 3 music sets of 3 songs each. So I guess 45 mins of play? Sound was great but they broke quickly and I don't see an option to fix/return.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'll be the first to admit it. I didn't spend much money on earphones. These earphones had me realize all the parts of music I was missing. They also helped with wind noise on my motorcycle. I highly recommend. They are a little bulky bits that's the only complaint I can even think of.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came directly to my door two days after I ordered them, on a Sunday. Really good quality, I can stand them being on full blast without any repercussions, although maybe not recommended for too long. Bass isn't too overwhelming, just the right amount of it. Noise barely gets through over music, unless someone is screaming at the top of their lungs, or volume is really low. The only negative thing about them, and its not even a significant issue, is the cord length, but I'm guessing since they are made for performers, I can't really complain about that. Overall. Excellent everything, well worth the amount I paid for them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned 2 pairs of the old Shure e2c's in the past, and while I liked the sound quality, they both ended up having problems with the cable, specifically the part that bends over the ear. Eventually on one ear or the other, the cable would get brittle, and the insulation would crack - boom, you'd start getting dropouts on that side. Bummer. I was excited to see that the new generation of Shure IEM's, even the ""low-end,"" now include...drumroll...detachable cables! Hooray! So now if a cable fails, just replace that part and keep rocking. But wait, there's more...they included TWO sets of cables, one for ""pro"" over-the-ear IEM style, and the other for smartphone use - it even has the microphone and volume controls. Awesome. And that cable has a 45-degree angled connector, which I'd never seen before but is surprisingly effective at keeping the plug in the jack while in a pocket, etc.

On to sound and fit. These seem on par or a little better than the old e2c's - nice, full low end, and plenty of detail. For casual listening, they're excellent. I found them quite good for stage use as well - paired with a Posse personal mixer, you've got a great onstage system. The housing of each earphone has a very slim profile, which looks good and allows for using them in bed to listen to music or watch videos - you can put your ear against the pillow and not feel the earphone pressing uncomfortably against the ear. The memory foam tips that come with it are excellent - a big step up from the old foam or rubber tips they used to supply. I bought an extra 5 pairs of the large tips, which fit me best, so I always have some on hand. Honestly, they seal better than the custom tips I had made for my old e2c's. Impressive. And they were cheaper!

For an entry level IEM, I don't think you could do much better than these."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted only 3 days until the left earbud started making an unbearable rattling sound when reaching high levels of treble and bass. Not the kinda durability I expected from Shure. Will change/update review when I receive my replacements. Other than that they sounded great while they lasted.
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given this 5 stars but for my initial difficulty in choosing the correct ear cover and getting them to stay in my ears. Finally in front of a mirror figured it out - the whole thing fits into the ear (duh :-)). I had never tried anything like this before and once I figured out how to keep them in, I was amazed at the outstanding quality of sound they provided. Glad I didn't give up and return them."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best damn earphones for traveling. Light weight and better sound than Bose and Beats. Great price
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will admit to being a Shure fan. I have owned a pair of their SCL4 earphones that I have always loved. Well, those became misplaced, so I set out to purchase new ones.

I debated about getting the SE215 VS the SE315 vs the much more expensive SE425's and decided to go with the less expensive SE215's based on their reveiws here and at other locations.

The earphones come with a set of the medium squishy foam inserts pre-installed. This was my only issue with this unit - the foam inserts had become welded onto the earpiece and I was using enough force to remove them that I was concerned for breaking my brand new earphones before even getting to use them. A quick trip to the Shure FAQ online and I found that if you can wedge your fingernail under the white plastic portion, you can pry them off. Shure also has some instructions for freezing the units (!!) to facilitate removal of the ear insert.

Once I finally got the correct sized inserts for me installed, I was finally able to listen to them. I mainly listen to pop/rock music and on occasion some classical. For pop/rock, these things are wonderful - tons of detail. I hadn't noticed that in the song ""Best Day of my Life"" that you can hear them counting in during one of the rests. Or all the atmospheric effects at the beginning of ""Kings and Queens"". I love being able to hear all those details. The bass levels are very nice - crisp and not too ""boomy"". With a good ear seal, I am plenty happy with the sound of these earphones.

For classical music, they are good, but probably not quite as nice as for pop/rock music. Now, it might be the quality of my recordings, (orchestra recordings aren't always the greatest), but it doesn't seem to pick out the details that I want to hear when I am listening to classical with them. If you mainly listen to classical, then you might look at the more expensive units Shure sells. It is possible however that I am overly picky, as I do play in an orchestra so I am used to listening to orchestras from the ""inside"" so to speak.

The connection to the removable cord seems very high quality. It is fairly simple to snap them in and out and the connection feels very solid. The cord is very long and very flexible, which is nice. The earpieces have a small section of bendable plastic right at the driver area, so that you can curve them around the top of your ears. Once you get the plastic formed for your ears, they just pop right in, very easily. I remember always having to fiddle with my old SCL4's and these go in much faster and seem much more comfortable.

For the price, these things are a steal. I wish I could do a direct comparison between these and my now lost SCL4's, but I am pleased as punch with the quality of these and I don't miss my old SCL4's at all."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these in ear headphones. I live in Texas and I run 3-4 times per week with the headphones. The sound is great and the cord is longer than other brands I've owned. It takes a while to get the cord and ear piece to fit perfectly. Therefore, I gave it 4 stars but it is more like 4.5 stars."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a Christmas gift for all 3 of my children and they can’t stop talking about them! Excellent quality!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think the bang for the buck here is the best you will find. Love mine and the six different ear pieces that come with them to find that perfect fit.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,The first test was nice. Very good performance.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally! I found ear buds for my workout where I'm not adjusting them. These are perfect for the gym, I workout at least 5 days a week a majority of the time weight lifting so I'm always in different angles and these ear buds allow me to focus 100% on my workout/music as before I would have to mess with adjustment when I really start to sweat, no more. I highly recommend them to my gym rats out there."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is amazing. I went from Beats buds to these and I'm very impressed. A little more difficult to put on than I'd like. It's a two handed process that can be pretty tricky on a New York subway.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking primarily for quality of build/longevity, and secondly, sound quality.

You can't go wrong with this pair. Built sturdy. The cord is the best quality I have seen (even reinforced where it wraps above your ear).

The sound quality is great. These days, companies sell their units bragging it has ""deep bass"" and such. These units have well-balanced lows, mids, and highs. (I rather rely on my EQ anyway, if I wanted higher lows or highs, for example)."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the fit and the quality, but despite having used the provided case and being extremely careful with the cord, the wire has broken through the reinforced rubber on both earbuds, the part that wraps behind your ear, after 9 months. I'm hopeful that this was just a defective product and I can get it replaced under warranty (left my warranty information at home and at college right now, so the replacement will have to wait)."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was very excited for this product. The sound quality was great but unfortunately after live 3 live Performances My Right Ear Bud Went out. Wish I could get a new one sent to me. I don't blame to company I just think it was a manufacturer defect.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left side of the headphones DOA straight out of the box....Returned for refund!
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Look great out of the package, and they sound super for the money. I'm using them on stage as in-ear monitors and these stay in place when I get sweaty from stage lights...and being fat! Fit and stay put much better than cheaper units I've used in the past. Getting a good ear seal seems to be crucial for good bass response, had plenty of different sized ear buds to accomplish that."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, but after a few weeks using the phones the logo on each driver started to wear off and today the left driver open it's casing. I'm starting to think these phones are fake."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Been using these for nearly a year. Very comfortable great sound quality and noise canceling. Only reason for the 4 stars is that the way they sit on/around your ear is awkward.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some if not the best headphones I have used in a while. I live in NYC and the noise from the subway can be deafening sometimes. This keeps the noise out and I can actually listen to my music comfortably. The quality of the cable (which can be removed) is very tough, if it can handle daily trips to and from work on the subway in the rain, snow, ice, and grime of NYC then trust me these can handle a lot. The range of sounds is great, you can really hear the many different instruments used in every song. You can finally listen to music the way it was meant to be heard. Get these if you are looking to listen to music, you will not regret it."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolation is better than any other in-ear devices I've used (Apple iPhone buds and inexpensive buds), but it's limited. If you're listening to a full rock/R&B/jazz/pop band, that will cover most of what bleeds through, but don't expect to have your ears to yourself if you have the music turned down, or if you're listening to music with silent spaces in it, or listening to, say, a drum solo, which just won't cover all of the frequencies. Maybe I'm not using the right size sleeve, but I've tried more than one, and the ones I'm using seem to be the best for my ears.

The sound seems very clear with a lot of higher frequencies available. Personally, I prefer more bass, though. I was used to Apple iPhone buds, which throw a lot of bass at you. However, I mostly listen to music on iTunes on a computer, which gives me a 10-band equalizer, so it's easy to pump up the bass.

The over-the-ear part is just a slightly heavier piece of cable; it's not hard plastic, so it's not at all uncomfortable. You don't have to run the wires over your ears, actually. At first I just stuck the things in my ears and let the cables hang down in front. Now I do run them back over my ears. The fact that the cable is detachable and can turn in its socket makes it easy to align the cable back over your ears.

All parts or the cables feel very thick and robust, and the ear pieces seem pretty robust. I worry a little bit about the plastic tubes that the sleeves attach to. You have to work pretty hard to remove the dense foam sleeves, and I worry about breaking the plastic tube that they sit on when removing a sleeve. It's kind of a delicate operation involving careful use of fingernails. However, you're not likely to remove sleeves very often, and on the plus side, the foam sleeves will not fall off and get lost underneath something. The hollow ""flex"" sleeves are easier to take off, but I don't think they would be likely to fall off, either.

(Note for iPhone users: Apple iPhone earbuds have an unusual feature: The plug that goes in the device socket is extra long. This allows them to work with an iPhone that has a thick case around the audio jack. These Shure headphones do *not* have an extra-length plug--just a standard length plug--so I can't use them with my iPhone without taking it out of the waterproof case I use. However, I bought the Shure's mostly for use with my computer.)"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a bit difficult to put in your ear properly, but once you do, they sound amazing. Listening to Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" will give you the chills at the climax. Good bass presence and I don't hear anything missing. Not a huge audiophile, but I tend to notice annoying issues with headphones and can't use cheap ones.

I plan to use these on a motorcycle for both hearing protection and music, so we'll see how that goes. I'll post back if they aren't awesome for that. There is some feedback when touching the wires, which is normal for these kinds of headphones, and I hope that doesn't ruin things on the bike.

I do wonder if the black color comes with nicer feeling wires. These are a little stiff. I suppose I can always get black wires, as they're replaceable (a major selling point for me with these c-note headphones).

The part of the wire that coils over the ear has some kind of bendable sheath around it - it doesn't want to bend perfectly and is a bit annoying. Maybe I'll figure out the best bend."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds for multiple hours a day during my commute + at work to block out ambient noise. Previous earbuds I've bought from both Creative and Sennheiser lasted anywhere from 1-2 years before one of the wires inevitably failed. I purchased these earbuds after reading from multiple sources that they were significantly more durable than other similar products on the market - with the added bonus that they have detachable wires.

Unfortunately, the Wednesday after I received these, i noticed the right ear would go dead when I turned my head to the left. After tinkering with the wires a bit, I discovered a point of failure just above the split from the single cable to the double cables. All in all, the supplied cable lasted 6 days.

In terms of usage and storage, I had zero incidents where the earbuds were snagged, tugged, or mishandled in any way. I made sure to gently wind up and store them in the carrying case they shipped with. The individual wires that run from the splitter up to the earbuds themselves feels quite thin and frail, so I'm not totally surprised it failed here, just that it failed this fast.

Quite a shame, because sound quality from these is excellent, and they're quite comfortable.

Fingers crossed that the warranty plan I got will actually come through and get this fixed in a timely fashion. Will update review in the future depending on how the replacement is handled."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty nice. They took a little getting used-to, especially in how to put them on. After a week or so it becomes automatic. They really are sound-excluding, so don't walk or drive with these. You can't hear a d@mn thing besides your music. My wife hates them. Some may consider this a bonus.

Music is clear and crisp. I was able to turn the volume WAY down, and still hear everything. In fact, I'd warn any buyer to be VERY sure the volume is turned way down first, before turning the music on. It will hurt like H3LL if you play at your normal earbud type volume and you just plug in and go. Trust me, I've done it several times.

These are probably the best headphones I've ever tried. The experience reminds me of the first time I heard the headphones on a walkman years ago after years of AM radio. A new world."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used in-ear monitors for many years now. I do have to admit I am quite spoiled in that I have a custom-designed set of Ultimate Ears 11 Pro, which have 4 drivers and custom fit to my ear. Nothing I've ever used as an IEM/headphone comes close to the UE 11 Pro Custom.

Given that as background though, these are solid performers for $100, single driver IEMs. I use them primarily for running and going to the gym where I don't need the sound isolation or depth of field that my Ultimate Ears give. And, I did use them on stage for a couple shows (I'm a drummer) and was pleasantly surprised at how well they held their ground. These are the IEMs that the rest of my band used, being what came in the box with our Shure wireless IEM system, and they all liked the sound reproduction and external isolation.

I do suggest ordering the EATFL1-6 triple flange sleeves for these regardless of your use model. The triple flange sleeve will provide you both a little more exterior noise isolation, and help fit in the ear more securely if you are using these in an active setting like running.

I can definitely suggest these to any band just starting out with an IEM system, all drummers who want to practice with hearing protection and be able to jam to tunes on an iPod and not have the bulk of headphones, and to the active set who want something that sounds better and stays in the ears better than iPod ear buds."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,These sound great but I just got so tired of wrestling them to get a good fit. The memory wire is equally useful and annoying. If you can’t get a perfect seal they sound terrible and that is by design. I just lost my patience trying to get them just right.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep it simple - after years of wondering how I'd like these strange-looking earphones, I decided to pick them up when they were on sale for about $80.

Sound: excellent, especially for the price. Crisp and clear across a wide range, and complaints about their bass capabilities are exaggerated. In fact, I find the bass pleasingly strong and yet to disappoint after about 9 months of continuous use. Mid's and high's are great - but not enough to 'WOW' you, especially compared to full-size headphones. But that's too be expected. Overall, 4.75/5.

Isolation: superb. I use these at work when I need to concentrate and block out background noise. Put on some music - even at a mid-level volume - and you won't hear much going on around you. Very pleased, 5/5.

Fit: again, excellent, once you get used to them. The options of interchangeable buds that come standard are very good, and I found a combo that works great for my big ears. Plus - even if you don't like any of the standard offerings, there are plenty of cheap third-party replacements you can try. 5/5.

My only knock on these is the cord. The sections that wrap around your ears and lead to the phones themselves start flexible, easy to mold to your ear shape. However, I found that this 'moldable' section wore out, and lost strength after about 3 months. The sound is unaffected by this development, but it makes them pretty annoying to try and get a perfect fit. Overall, frustrating, but doesn't affect sound quality, 2.5/5."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. One side stopped producing any noise after a few months, The process of replacing them was very simple and quick.'

I don't like the wire that goes behind the ear to hold the earphones in place. Initially it feels confusing trying to figure out which way the wire is suppose to be rotated to fit around the ear. It certainly doesn't feel intuitive. However I have gotten used to the design and it is easy to put the wire in the correct position now.

My complaint is that the wire does not stay in a strong position. It constantly feels loose, and even though the headphones stay on fine, I find myself wishing the wire provided a more snug fit.

One of the things I love most about the headphones is their flat profile. I very often listen to music in bed before sleeping and end up on my sides a lot. With my other headphones this is uncomfortable because they put extra pressure on the ear. The flat profile of this earbuds helps to relieve that pressure a lot when my head is pressed against the pillow."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, I thought it was only okay. I needed a replacement after my Meelectronics A161P broke. A161P set a high standard for sound quality for me, so although this pair was great on certain points, it just did not meet my expectations.

Pros
- Excellent sound isolation - I wore these while commuting on the train, so that's a huge plus
- Mids and highs were great
- Cables were thick and gave the impression of sturdiness, and the ability to replace the cable is a nice thought

Cons:
- Fussy, clunky and uncomfortable - People warned about this, true, but I still wanted to give it a shot. I've never had to adjust earbuds so much! They felt too big in my ears and would often stick out. Also, I had to adjust the cable over my ears too often. It's a deal breaker.
- Not balanced - bass heavy. The bass level was too distracting for me. This was disappointing because many reviews hailed this pair as being ""balanced"". Clearly, it's not. If you like extra bass, this would be a nice feature, but not for me.
- Sitting unmoving was fine, but once I started walking, every move I made produced that ""underwater"" feeling. Also very distracting. I've had a few other noise isolation earbuds where this was a minor setback.
- Cable was too long. When walking around it can get caught on stuff
- Didn't care for the carry case

Over all, for how much it cost and the list of cons, I felt compelled to return this item. After this pair, I realized that I much prefer balanced armature earbuds like Meelectronics A161P. The only gripe I had about A161P was that the cables were flimsy and so the pair didn't even last a year. But the noise isolation was also excellent, and the ""underwater"" feeling was minimal compared to this pair. (If you love extra bass, you would probably not like the A161P.)

So next I got Etymotic HF2 (similar price level), and I'm far happier with that because it has:
- Balanced armature drivers and to me more sound balanced than these Shures (great mids, highs, and bass level was strong but not overpowering)
- Excellent sound isolation
- Not clunky and fit well in my ears
- ""Underwater"" feeling was minimal
- Cable length was just right and seems sturdy
- Nice carry case"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for earphones to listen to sleep sounds at night. All others I tried were too bulky or poorly constructed. I had the westone um-1 earphones and they were okay but the right ear stopped working. These shure's are durable, non-instrusive and sound great. I love that the cord breaksaway so I have no fear of choking myself at night. Definetly recommend these if your need some to use for sleeping."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid headphones. My only gripe is that they fit strangely around the ears. It's a hassle setting them up.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair. The first set broke after a couple years but I sort of abused them. The sound on these things is absolutely amazing, coming from a life of $20-30 headphones.

The foam buds are very comfortable and excellent at isolating sound, it ships with three rubber sizes and three foam sizes."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very good, great for a transatlantic flight and i can drone out everyone else, it was impossible to fall asleep with big noise cancelling headphones. The sure are flush with my ears."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to love the freedom of bluetooth for my SE425's but the novelty wears off really quickly.

Pro's: great battery life

Con's:
1. Reduced sound quality. You lose the crispness and hi fidelity that makes you buy Shure in the first place. There's a constant buzzing/feedback that you can hear when the music is paused.
3. The design is frustrating at best. Ok so you can clip the battery pack to the back of your shirt and everything is fine, but then the mic/controls are behind your head... means that you have to adjust your setup every time you want to answer a call because the phone will prefer the bluetooth mic unless you disconnect the entire set. You have to wear the cable in front of you to use the mic, but the earphones are designed to loop over your ears and tie in the back, making it really awkward. And why does Shure insist on using memory wire? It adds bulk and weight to the ears, greatly increasing ear fatigue; I had to take a break after a few hours, which is not something I worry about with my cables (I removed the memory wire on those as well).
2. For a company known to make microphones, this Mic is utterly useless. Even when directly in your face the sound comes out very low quality and breaks here and there. Forget about using it if you tie the cables behind your head."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You really can't hear anyone when you have these on, which is pretty amazing, because I never really want to hear anyone.

removing the foam attachments is difficult. Once you get the technique down, it becomes easier. Best way to do it is to take something non-metalic (end of credit card, etc) and push from the bottom up on the center rubber body of the foam attachment.

Anyway, sound on these is amazing. I can't say I've tried earbuds that sound better than these. For $100, they blow away just about everything"
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality when working correctly. The problem is that if you use these working out they need constant cleaning. Never really got a true fit out of these and they lasted 18 months before one of the ears stopped working. The ability to change cables seems to create additional problems. I bought them for $100 and thought I would get more out of them. They are not water resistent in the least bit. Overall I would rate these as fair. I refuse to pay more then $100 for any earbuds since the mark up on these product is so significant.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones, they are my second pair, replacing an older pair I had. The sound is great!
I do have a ""complaint"" about this particular pair, they don't fit my ears near as well as my previous pair nor any other Shure in-ears I've used. They keep falling out during live performances and that's getting annoying. Not sure what's different, our family owns 5 pairs and they all fit well except this pair."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The left headphone cable started cutting in and out when moved after the first week of owning them. They have a 2 year warranty, but require me to send the cable back first before they will issue a replacement. I fly 2+ times a week and like to use these on my flights and don't really want to have any downtime without them. Bummed. For such a big company you'd think that they had an advanced ship warranty solution with a credit card hold so I could continue ""using"" them until the cable arrived. Also Shure does not cover the shipping of the cable back to them for warranty...figure it out Shure."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been keeping these as backup headphones since using them. My Audio Technica ATH-M50x pair broke after a few years, but these sound almost as good as those. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to have a pair of in-ears or to have as a backup pair."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound. Not for gaming as positional audio is terrible on fps's(at least in my experience). However thats not what I got them for. Their profile allows you to sleep with them on your side pretty comfortably,not perfectly, and the sound isolation is good enough that I can barely hear the mower when doing the lawn!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are worth every penny, best headphones I've ever owned and I've owned EVERY type you could imagine. They were recommended to me by my boyfriend who works in music and uses them in sound checking for pretty big bands."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate writing reviews, but feel as thought I owe it to the folks at Shure. This pair of headphones is easily my favorite piece of audio equipment I have ever owned. When it comes to traveling or casual listening, these phones have the best definition you would ever need for such purposes. Furthermore, if there is ever any deterioration of the actual headphone cables, they are inexpensive and very easy to replace.

Keep up the good work!"
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the low profile. I can keep these on under a helmet which was key for my choice. The sound is great, though it is often hard to get the plugs to sit well enough in the ear canal to have it sound 'best'. The long cord is both a pro and a con depending on the situation, but it's always better to error on the side of length (too short is the worst)."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Part of the cord was missing when we got it. When we got the replacement we realized that the first one was a fake...Shure has been given the info and is investigating. My son likes the real pair though.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. Durable and nice sound quality.
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these, and coming from a pair of Sennheiser CX215's, I can easily say these are the best earphones I've ever used. Very clean sound compared to anything I've used before, a nice amount of bass, and I'm hearing details in my music that my cheaper earphones just cannot show. I never knew what I was missing, always going with cheap, budget earphones and headphones, but now I can safely say that I'm never going back."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect sounds, great bass, sound isolating and very comfortable to wear. My last 3 sets of headphones I have purchased were Shure brand and I am so impressed. So much better than Bose and a better price."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side started to fail after only about a month of moderate use. It works most of the time, but sometimes cuts out intermittently. This is way too fast for a $100 pair of headphones to stop working.. Even if it is just the replaceable cable."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"note 1: ALL Shure earbuds WILL experience problems after 6 months. however, Shure provides excellent 2-yr warranty. you ship the merchandise back to Shure and they return good units in about 2 weeks.

note 2: SE215CL or SE215K?
according to Shure, they are one and the same except the casing and wire, CL is ""clear"" transparent casing and wiring. K is black casing and wiring. i own BOTH however, for some reasons i found the K (black) much better sound than CL. if i had to do it again, i will go for K (black casing).

i have been using Shure earbuds since 2005
e3c, e5c, SE215, SE435.... all extremely good earbuds priced from $100-$400.
by my assessment, SE215 is the best earbud ($99) consider the price to benefit ratio
no doubt you get better more refined sound in SE435 and e5c (discontinued) but the additional pricing (300% more) certainly does not deliver 300% better sound. i would say for the additional $200 you pay for SE435, you get at best 10%-15% better sound compared to the SE215.

conclusion:
if money is not an issue, buy the SE435 or even SE535, they are really good.
but if you want to be smart consumer, and don't mind 10%-15% less sound quality, SE215K is what you need."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I use these in the gym and they work great. Battery life is decent at 6 hours but 8 hours would have made a big difference. I never loose connection and the sound quality is pretty good. However placing the in-line control so far from the ear piece is extremely uncomfortable to access if you want to wear these with the cable behind your head. This prevents me from wanting to use them most of the time being as I use the controls often to change music and volume. I don't understand why it would be designed this way. Additionally the cable could be a little shorter. It's the little details that prevent a good product from being great.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for the price, only a shade behind the Westone 3's which are quite a bit more expensive.

3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I did notice however that the ideal bits to use are the memory foam ends and not the silicone ends because the silicone hurt my ears when I'm removing them after use. Another down side is that the ends right out of the buds are very stiff and you have to wrap them around your ears for them to fit but once they are in, they are definitely not going anywhere. The sound quality far exceeded my expectations because after I saw a mediocre low range, I was surprised when the low end was crystal clear and definitely present. I strongly recommend these earbuds if you are comparing these to beats. You are only paying for Dr. Dre's naming in development with the beats."

On the other hand, the noise isolation and build quality seem good."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whenever I switch to cheaper earbuds they just don't satisfy like these. these earbuds are very comfortable and fit in my ears well and don't bother me at all when I wear them to bed which is every night at the fact that you can change the cable is a great addition
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really dislike earphones that you have to shove into your ear, but for the portability and sound isolation, these are pretty amazing.

Overall, I think these are the best in-ear headphones below 100 bucks. I was skeptic when I first got them but now I can say I would buy them again"
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit nicely, especially if you're playing in a band. They're comfortable and come with a few different earpieces. I don't abuse them so I don't know how tough they are. I have worn them with my ipod too and they sound fantastic."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these ear-buds early december (about 2.5 months ago). The right speaker has cut out and isn't making any noise. This sounds like a speaker failure rather than wiring issue since there was no crackling or gradual decline in sound quality. My return window has passed so I'm currently furious about spending $100 on earbuds that lasted less than three months. I used them lightly and never worked out with them.
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the sound of this earpphone I love it especially because I like to sleep with earphonns and these walls are very comfortable to sleep with
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third set of SE215s. Each set lasts me over a year, which is impressive. I go through cheap headphones in less than 3 months. Aside from being fairly durable, the sound quality on these is stellar - I'll buy a 4th set when these wear out."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these ear buds!!!!! I thought that these buds compared to the last pair of Sennheiser buds that I had purchased and were more comfortable. More comfortable, but had a very crisp high ends. This was great, but to me the bass was a bit compromised at times. If you run an EQ this becomes a moot point and most audio sources have a downloadable EQ. After I bought these last year I sprung for some really upscale buds, i.e., the Sennheiser IE80's. I think that at this point that I've reached perfection to my ears........"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who knew that you could buy $100 in ears and they would actually seal inside your ear and give you great isolation? The transparency is spot on for the price. I program and track live and these work great.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using them riding my motorcycle. they are a bit stiff to wrap around your ears at first. I wish they made the same cable as the stock one but with the skip song and answer a call option on the cable. The stock cable is awesome though, very flexible and strong."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound and sound isolation. Not too comfortable when worn for more than an hour. Very high quality build, especially the Kevlar coated wires. Compared to a pair of Bose active sound isolating headphones, these are cheaper, more discreet and deliver comparable results in terms of sound and sound isolation. A great product if comfort is not your first priority. Make sure you insert them as deep as possible and keep the volume low... The sound is delivered very very close to your eardrums."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Effective on the airplane. I also like the sound quality of these SE215-CL, but after I wear them for a long time my ears begin to hurt. Additionally the way the ergonomics work on these headphones the wire has to wrap around your ear. I find that it never really stays fully in place, especially if your the type that has an active lifestyle. I find myself constantly fidgeting around with the wire to get it in the right place."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"VEry nice sound. It takes a few trials to get the little wires around your ears and the buds inside the ears (the swiveling doesnt help!), so dont despair, it can be done."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I own the SE215 (wired version) and I purchased the BT cable separately The BT extension works perfectly.

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a fan of Shure Earphones for a long time, and my other set are the SE530's, which I have loved forever.

I got these for my wife, who wanted good sound quality but a more reasonable price. I got my SE530's about 6 years ago, so the brand has changed a bit since then.

The detachable cables are a great feature. The old earphones had a nasty habit of splitting where the wire went into the earpiece, leaving you with dud plugs. This makes cleaning the wires easy, and replacing them when they break easier.

The clear plastic is cool I guess. I don't really care one was or another since they go where I can't see them, but it is certainly a different style.

What I don't like is the metal wire in the speaker wire where it meets the earbud. The idea is that you can bend it into a shape that fits your ear, but my favorite part about the Shure buds was that they wrap around your ear easily and snugly. The stiff wire actually makes this harder, especially with the new detachable cable.

Still, the sound quality is stellar, and when I need new headphones, I'll get Shures, for sure."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones take a bit of fiddling to get a nice, tight fit. But once you get the fit right, they provide outstanding sound-isolation and fidelity. If you wear the cord behind your head, they never accidentally get pulled out of your ears. Excellent ergonomics."

5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great noise isolation, long lasting.

6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are absolutely worth the money. You won't be disappointed. We wear them while motorcycling and I never miss a single nuance whether it's Wagner or Pink Floyd. I love these things!! At the gym I'm never bothered by other chatters or peoples loud tromping on the treadmills anymore, talk about total noise cancelation!"
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing about these IMHO is the isolation. You can really tune out noisy on-stage sources with these. Also the price is right. I wouldn't go any cheaper. I like the biggest single-flange gels.

0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEMs are great! As an entry level audiophile I searched the web high and low to find the best pair of IEMs for me and I'm happy to say that I think the SE215's are them. This is my third or fourth set up nicer IEMs and all I can say is that these have absolutely no business sounding this good. For less than $100 you are going to change the way that you think about music. The only word of caution that I give is to give the memory cable some time, a few of my friends (whom I convinced to buy some 215s) loved the sound but simply couldn't get used to the way that the cord laid over their ears -- after a bit of time they too fell in love though."

2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As other reviewers have said, the sound quality of these in ear monitors is very impressive. I will not get technical and break down the frequency response curve and such since others have already done so. I will simply say that to me they sound great. the only problem for me is that the outer part of my ears where the body of the iem sits is on the small side, so they do become uncomfortable for me to ware for long periods. But oh the do sound so good."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for Shure E2C earphones that I've had for 6+ years and which still work although the insulation around the wires is cracking a lot which is the only reason I'm replacing them. I've had the SE215s for several months and the sound is just as good ad my old E2Cs with excellent, rich, deep sound and phenominal noise reduction. I'm not an audiophile and listen mainly to jazz and classical -- never rock. The sound quality of these earphones is great, as good as if I'm listening to my large floor speakers playing from my stereo.

Noise reduction is phenominal, just like my old E2C earphones. I wear these on the NYC subway which is extremly noisy and never have to raise the volume which I keep somewhat low. Ditto at the gym where music is blaring over the loudspeakers and it doesn't bother me (that's why I bought my E2Cs in the first place, so I could listen to my music at the gym).

Sometimes I will plug the the earphones into my ear and not listen to anything, just to use them as ear plugs so I can sleep on public transportation.

The problem is with the cords. These earphones, like the old E2Cs, are worn by wrapping the cord over the ear -- it's bizarre if you've never used them before but I got very used to it on my E2Cs and loved them. However, the SE215s have a much, much thicker cord that simply does not bend enough and has never conformed to the shape around my ear. It alwasy feels like they're falling out. And if I try to have the cords go down my back it's even worse. These heavy duty cords, which I am sure will last a long time, are the only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars.

Update 12/25/14: Just thought I'd mention that after two years of frequent I have the following additional comments:
1. The stiffness of the cord as it bends around my ear is still an issue. Much less that when it was new, certainly, but it's still an issue

2. Of perhaps greater importance is that if you use this with a phone, such as I do with an iPhone 5s, and you put the phone in a case, you will very possibly NOT be able to plug it into the phone without an extender or without taking the phone partially out of the case. The plug is a standard 3.5mm male jack but the casing or jacket around it is so thick that it does not insert into the phone's jack while the case on. In fact, the diameter of the casing around the plug is actually greater than the depth of the 5s!. I am sure this was done to make the whole thing sturdier and lasting but it creates a problem. When I first got these earphones I had a different device with a case that had a huge opening and it wasn't an issue. But it's an issue with my iPhone 5s case and it would be an issue with every iPhone case I've looked at. You need to buy an extender or partially remove it from the case. If you don't use a case then it's not an issue"

8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes a quality product, these are no exception and the prices Amazon sells them at are pretty insane. These earbuds will absolutely destroy the ambient noise around you with no active noise cancellation tomfoolery. They have insanely good bass as long as you wear tips that fit you properly. Make sure you do that. Response is all-around fantastic, the bass is just so striking from such a small package.

The only problem is they're easy to lose. It's just a good excuse to upgrade to the most recent model."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For my application I could give these a 4+ but the lows aren't really there so overall, they're a 3. I use them for vocals only and the band has to ""pass thru"" since they aren't in the monitor mix. The result- I can here the band and my drums clearly although the volume is lower and and I can control how much vocal I get in my ears. As a plus, I'm able to lower the overall volume to my ears. If the band were in the monitor mix, I think I would want something with a little more low end response, but for this very specialized application, they are perfect, especially at this price point."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shure makes the best sounding in ear headphones. I have been using shure headphones for 20 years and this is the third model in ear I have purchased. I have tried others but nothing sounds better than shure./ I love them
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding earphones! The sound isolation is better than I expected. I ride a loud motorcycle with a half helmet, so wind noise always drowned out the music at highway speeds. With these in, I can actually hear the music without cranking the volume to max. My only complaint is that it's so hard to change the earpieces. Luckily the medium foam fits well, because it feels like I'll break the stem if I try any harder to remove them."
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, the isolation is perfect for my noisy work office. I was thinking about going with some bass boosted headphones but these deliver great bass as it is. I got the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves as well since the foam ear buds that came stock did not fit well when I would sweat while working out. Even just with the headphones in and no music playing I can barely hear anyone in my office."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product overall, but I have no idea why the wire is about 300 feet long. I'm gonna need a hose reel to keep this thing together. If it didn't work so well I might be inclined to cut it in half use it as the world's most expensive pair of shoe laces."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son (a drummer) loves these. He wears them live when playing with a band and also when practicing with recorded music. Much higher quality than any common ""ear bud"" style headphones; these are professional quality sound equipment."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,So just got these headphones yesterday and after listening to them today I've noticed how the volume turns down on it's own or that the music just stops playing... I don't know if I got a defected one or what the problem is but overall they're not that bad.. I did think they'd be louder than what they are though but they do block out outside noise which is a huge plus
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product in that it adds BT to existing support SHURE SE earbuds. However, after two months, the battery quickly drains in off mode within 48 hours and the fit around the back of the neck is awkward. I have a call into support to see if I can get it warrantied."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. They almost sound as good as my $300 Bose noise cancelling headphones. Highly recommended for the money.
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on these earphones is amazing for the pricepoint.

Only complaint:Learning how to fit them over your ear does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it they fit super snug."
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You have to get used to how they have to be positioned in your ear, but after that - these are fantastic for the price!"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my third pair of Shure's, and the first that I've had any trouble wearing. They're much bigger than the SE115s I am trying to replace, the stiff cord around the ears near is annoying, but the real problem was the size and shape of the ear buds vs the size and shape of my ears. Without proper positioning, you don't get good sound, but putting them in that position was painful. They did sound good, but I am not going to endure any kind of pain just to listen to my iPod. Bring Back The SE115s!!"
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit. I have had many pairs of Shure wired and these do not disappoint.
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old E5c's finally died on me after many years of service (wires got caught on one too many weight machines)...I loved the way they sounded and fitted, so I went with these...They have blown me away. They sound just as good, with even more bass. I don't know how Shure does it. I paid around $350 for my E5c's back in the day...These are a 100% steal.

I'm sure someone has mentioned it already, but I highly recommend you CAREFULLY remove the plastic sheath and metal rod where the wire meets the earbud. So much easier to maneuver the wire around your ear.

Thank you Shure!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I replaced my worn out ultimate ears with these Shure215's and I like these better. Isolation is very good. Bass response is better than my old pair and overall comfort is good. I like the cable as it's heavier duty than my previous ones and it's replaceable. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and shipping and pricing can't be beat!
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, these IEMs are pretty over hyped. They sound decent. They are designed for accuracy, so highs mids and lows are all pretty bland, just accurate. But for a 100 bucks they're pretty decent. None of the earpieces were comfortable for me."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfecto
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the best headphones to use for traveling. If you use the included foam earplugs you can not hear anything but your music. Oh and about that music, these headphones sound great. They sound as good as my open back over the ear headphones. They may lack a little bass but I was never a bass head so that does not bother me."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds i have used. Foam tips are the best.
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes a while to figure out how to wear them right, but once you have them on right you wouldn't want to remove them and you won't even feel a thing! I sometimes just get up from my chair and try to walk away and I am pulled back by the wires.

Quality wise, these are my first high end earphones so I don't have a lot to compare it with, but a lott better then what I used to own. They are totally worth the price!"
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phones themselves sound great. Certainly not an audiophile, but I can appreciate the clear highs and mids this pair outputs. If you can find the correct fit, there is solid bass as well. It's sort of a chore to put them in your ear and it was initially difficult to find the right fit. Once you get the fit though, things begin to look up. The biggest issue however, is the discomfort the phones cause after extended listening sessions. They begin to hurt your ear (not the canal) but the outside of your ear and the top where they wrap around. I tried to love these, but the discomfort caused makes them unbearable for me."
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is ok and it looks cool but the only way you can wear them is by wrapping them partly around your ear and that hurts my ears
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre sound .you won't get the wired sound of your se215s. Dead in two months lol really? Cmon shure. Why is this $99?? Where is the value at? An 18 dollar bluetooth cable sounded better. Don't buy this! just buy something else with those $99.your not far from some better products save your money
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a motorcycle and the wind noise alone makes you want to wear earplugs. And while one has something stuffed in their ears it might as well be nice to hear some music or some talk radio. Well I have tried expensive and inexpensive well-known and no name brands. None of them seemed to do the trick. Either they were too uncomfortable continuously fell out or had no base or sound quality at all. Then I tried the Shure SE215-CL wireless earbuds and have been extremely satisfied and impressed. Not only do they fit in the ear perfectly, they have a molded plastic section that occupies your whole ear opening plus a softphone insert that goes into the ear canal, but the sound is incredible. Even going down the road at 90 miles an hour with the wind ripping by my head, I can still hear the music perfectly with an incredibly good bass response. They fit like the earbuds that you see music recording artists use when making live performances. I highly recommend these earbuds. They might be a little bit more expensive than some but they are far cheaper than the Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling and they are much cheaper than the Klipsch earbuds. And the fit is very very good they come with a whole selection of different assorted months of buds and lengths of canal tubes so that you can customize these two whatever your ear size is. They stay in the ear as well which is very important. You almost have to pry them out of your ear to get them out. Even with the earbuds turned off they are such a good fit that they act as a noise canceling type of ear protection. Once again I recommend these highly to anyone wanting good sound quality whether they're on a bike or just mowing the lawn or just sitting in your room they are fantastic."
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sounding in-ear-phones. Well-built. Detachable cord is nice if you have to replace it. Excellent external noise isolation. You get more when you pay more but I feel these are well worth the money.
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality. Noticeably better than other earphones I own (about $20 price range) even with low quality sources like my laptop or my cell phone.

However, the procedure to insert the earphones in your ear in the correct position is a bit complex, time consuming and awkward."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as i break headphones very often. These headphones are a very solid product. They are also modular so they can be fixed easily.
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, feels like the music is being injected directly into my brain. Sound isolation works perfectly, can barely hear the lawn mower when mowing the lawn wearing these.

It loses one star because the cord is pretty darn long. Additionally, these headphones are quite bass heavy, luckily I'm running Viper4Android to soften the bass and push up the treble a bit, makes these headphones sound fracking amazing."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had other Shure noise isolating earphones in the past, in a different design. I find this design is harder to use. I'm always struggling to get the wire part over my ear, and the ear piece securely in my ear. Once I manage to do that, they work well."
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the most comfortable earphones I've tried (vs Apple Earpods and Steelseries Flux). I am using the foam tips and they provide reasonable isolation from the background noise while sounding great.
0,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love everything about these buds. Yes, they may take a little bit of time to find what size fits your ear. But once you do.....beautiful sound. Used to use Klipsch S4 and S4i, but they had durability issues (my only real qualm with them actually). But these buds step up the sound quality (just a tad, but it's noticeable, especially in highs and the overall body of the sound is just deeper and more pronounced). The Shure's come in with a bit more weight, but feel much more sturdy. Good $100 replacement, very happy I moved from my Klipsch"
1,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these when I play in my church all the time. We have an in ear monitor system and these are amazing. They are clear and they are not super expensive. The perfect balance.
2,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to try and give a non audiophile review of these. If you want an audiophile review, read some of the other top reviews and save yourself some time and stop reading this now.

So, seriously, Shure should market these as ear plugs with free headphones. Their ability to block sound is absolutely amazing. To the extent that these headphones should be standard issue for any frequent flyer. No longer do you need to lug around sound canceling cans when you have these lil guys in your briefcase. Crying babies, clapping, chatty kathy sitting next to you -- Gone. I mean, these guys completely isolate you from the outside audible would.

Beyond blocking outside sound, the headphone quality is pretty good. Within the price range of these guys there are probably a few choices with slightly better sound quality. But as far as sound quality is concerned, these headphones really seem to error on the side of being a better Rock/Pop head phone than Classic Piano or Hard core rap. The highs are pretty sharp -- and the lows won't rattle your fillings. But what really makes these shine is the lack of outside noise pollution and how well they place you in the middle of the music you're listening too. These are probably the closest you can get to cans without buying cans.

Install Tip 1: It is awkward putting them in the first few times. Really, and sorry for being crude, the easiest way it follow the same rules you would for putting on a condom. Pinch the tip, then hold it in place while using the other hand to roll the wire around your ear.

Install Tip 2: These are not labeled 'R' and 'L'. Instead they have red and blue dots on them. Just remember ""Red is Right"" and it'll save you some headaches.

They're Spinning!: Also, they spin freely, and can end up backwards. Putting them in backwards doesn't end well.

iPhone: If you plan on using these on an iPhone w/ a case, the plug is a bit thick, It works fine with my bumper, but would need to be modified to fit into my wifes Otter case.

Finally, I DO NOT recommend these for people who plan on wearing them in an urban environment. Simply, you will get hit by a bus. I cannot stress how little of the outside world you can hear when these are inserted. If you are looking for a head phone to wear on your bike, on you walk to work, or anything else that involves being around large high speed metal boxes -- for your own safety -- don't buy these. Everyone else, it's hard to go wrong with these. I Highly recommend them."
3,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have never used this kind of ear monitor before, give yourself about a half hour to figure out how to fit them to your ears before you have to go on stage and use them. They really do cancel out sound! Worth the money!"
4,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice product, happy with the purchase. The sound quality is very good, much better than the previous earphones I had. The earbuds fit very well and the foam fit does a quality job of outside noise cancellation (I can hardly hear anything over the music at very low levels). Wrapping the cord over and behind the ear was a new concept for me and a little strange to put in at first, but feel much more securely set. Note, longer hair hanging over your ears can be a frustrating to put in if you are not used to this style."
5,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass response. 4 stars because these headphones take a while to learn to wear. can be a little uncomfortable as well, especially when you are wearing them while you are in your bed or when you are working out. They are heavy as well."
6,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not call them audiophile earphones (if there is such a thing), but they block out at least 50% of volume of outside noise, are very well built, and have a very strong mid-range."
7,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The perfect earphone for the subway commuter. Also, good for doing dishes and listening to podcasts, because you don't have to turn up to the volume to hear well (thus limiting possible hearing damage)."
8,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these with my apple watch. They work great!
9,Shure SE215-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these earphones to run for 30 minutes 3 days a week, and within a month the left earbud stopped working. The sound quality was amazing, but these broke faster than the other $15 ones I had purchased. Definitely get these with the warranty."
