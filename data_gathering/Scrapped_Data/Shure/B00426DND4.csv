0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't consider myself an ""audiophile"" in the strictest sense of the word. I do, however, like to enjoy my music the way I believe it was meant to be heard. In my experience, Shure earphones provide some of the best sound quality for the price. While they are not in any way cheap, there are certainly far more expensive options out there.

I have used a pair of Shure E4c's for the past three years on an almost daily basis. I absolutely loved them. Unfortunately with that much use the cords began to get brittle and started to fray until a few weeks ago, one of the wires finally completely cut out. This is a common occurrence for all earphones which are used extensively. I contacted Shure customer service to inquire about repairs, replacement, and their advice on a comparable product now available. Shure's customer service delivered a highly detailed and cordial response within 24 hours. I learned that I could repair my E4c's for around $110. Alternatively, I was told that the Shure SE315's were being released in September and they were in the price range I originally paid for my E4c's. So, I decided to go on Amazon and pre-order the SE315's.

Today I received them in the mail. They are somewhat larger than my old E4c's, however I think they are more ergonomically in line with my ears, thus they are more comfortable. There are a number of improvements that Shure has made over the E4c's. First, the cords are now detachable. This is an enormous evolution and easily the best feature of these earphones. If the cord does go bad some years down the road, I can order a replacement for a fraction of the cost of full repair. Second, the top of the cord, near the earphone, is now moldable. Thus you can mold the cord easily over your ear and it stays put. It is also made with kevlar, making it more durable and hopefully, less prone to the problems of past cords.

Finally, the sound quality itself is much, much improved. The bass is full and rich with absolutely no distortion. The highs are also incredible and you can hear even the slightest nuances in music, even at low levels. Truth be told, I have been listening to songs just to see how they now sound with these new earphones. They sound that good. In fact, in some songs I have heard entire new sounds and noises that I'd never heard before.

I use high quality digital files and a Zune HD to listen to my music. I don't use an amp. Like I said, I'm not an ""audiophile"" but I can appreciate a good set of earphones and realize that to enjoy your music to its fullest you need to invest in a good pair. If you are happy with the stock earbuds that come with an iPod Touch or the equivalent, something like the Shure SE315's is certainly not for you. That said, once you experience the truly unbelievable sound quality these deliver, I believe no one can go back.

The best sound from new earbuds comes after 400-500 hours of playback after the driver has had a chance to get worked in. However, the SE315's already sound a magnitude better than the E3c's. I am ecstatic with my purchase. If you have the money to spend, you can't go wrong with these earphones. Having listened to the Shure SE425's I honestly can't recommend them over the SE315's given the $100 premium. The SE315's sound absolutely amazing and in my opinion, are worth more than $200.

With Shure's two year warranty and excellent customer service, the SE315's are a downright awesome purchase, not to mention they sound spectacular. Trust me, with the SE315's, you will be rediscovering your music all over again.

****October 26, 2010 Update****

After using these everyday for the past month, I feel even better about my purchase, if that is possible. The clarity of these earphones is nothing short of amazing, which has made my listening of radio on my Zune HD a hit or miss affair. Regular FM radio sounds compressed, garbled, and full of audio artifacts, not to mention static. Luckily, HD radio sounds a lot better. I primarily use my Zune to listen to my own library of music, but it's nice to hear the radio sometimes. These earphones will provide you with both the good and the bad in that regard. Still, listening to my personal library has never been more enjoyable.

Also, the new design of these earphones is fantastic when it comes to listening to them in bed. I will listen to music or watch movies on Netflix on my iPad at night, and I can now do so on my side. The design of these earphones is such that when they are in your ear, they are flush with the side of your ear. Therefore, you can lay on your side without them jutting into your ear and causing pain and discomfort. These are the only earphones I've ever had where this was possible. It makes for a huge difference in using them when I lay down or go to sleep, as I now can lay on either side or my back.

Overall, I still have no complaints. These earphones were a great purchase.

****December 2, 2010 Update****

I guess I am a little surprised by the 3 star reviews some others have been giving these earphones. However when I look at the complaints, they are all valid for the most part. If you aren't used to earphones like these there is definitely an introduction/break-in period that you go through. I do, however, disagree with people complaining about the sound quality. But that is an opinion.

As for my continued use, not much has changed. I still use them almost daily and they have been holding up fantastically. No signs of sound or cord degradation at all. I still maintain that they are very comfortable, but it always depends more on what you were coming from I guess. If you absolutely loved how your old earphones fit then any change will be jarring. However I am completely used to these now and love them. Was still a great purchase and I still whole heartedly recommend these.

****July 20, 2011 Update****

My earphones have been through quite a lot since I purchased them in September 2010. I've used them on an almost daily basis, and for very long periods of time in some cases. Since I've purchased them, I listen to them almost nightly, while I go running, and around the house on the weekends. They have also accompanied me on a flight to Las Vegas and back, (from Florida) as well as on international flights from Philadelphia to Barcelona and back. Needless to say, I still loved them and they have been performing great.

So, you can imagine my shock and horror when my left bud suddenly stopped working last week. I quickly went on Shure's website and printed out the requisite forms to send my earphones in for repair and mailed them out on Monday, July 11th. I figured I would not wait to put Shure's 2 year all inclusive warranty to the test. On Wednesday, July 13th I received an email notification that they had received my earphones and that I would be contacted if there were any issues. And then today, July 20th, I received my earphones back from Shure, the malfunctioning earbud replaced with a new one. And all is good and great in the world! But seriously, I received my earphones back from repair in 9 days, at least 4 of which were shipping, and 2 were over the weekend. So Shure's team turned around my warranty claim, replaced my earphone, and shipped it back to me in about three days.

When mailing my earphones to Shure I was resigned to having to wait weeks, maybe even over a month to receive them back. This had nothing to do with Shure, just expectations from previous warranty repairs in the past I've had to deal with from other companies. I am ecstatic about the service and ease of which it took place. Shure clearly stands by their products and obviously honors their warranty. Again, I love these earphones and this experience has made me even more confident in choosing Shure.

****January 08, 2013 Update****

It has been another year and a half since my last update and I am happy to report that these earphones are still going strong and still sound great. I have had no problems and I still use them on almost a daily basis. I am not sure what the newest models are like at this point, but I am still very confident in recommending these after several years and thousands of hours logged listening to music, playing games, and watching movies. Still highly recommended!"
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I'm really not understanding a lot of the negative reviews. These headphones are easily the BEST set of headphones I have ever purchased. I am not an ""audiophile"" - I'm a DJ and I love music and appreciate clear, balanced sound with little coloration (especially for when I'm mixing). I want to preface this by saying that yes, I listen to house music (deep house, tech house, techno) 90% of the time, but I have had experience with these headphones playing all types of music.

I have owned many pairs of headphones. In order: Reloop RHP-10's (sub par but for a decent price I guess), Klipsch S4i's, Sennheiser HD-25 ii's, and Klipsch x7i's. To go through these in order: 1) Broke in under a year, 2) lost a pair, second pair broke in under a year. 3) Lost a pair, still have the second pair, still going strong, they are now my backup pair and I still love them, 4) Bought a pair, they crapped out, got another pair, crapped out, both well under a year. Yes, I'm hard on my headphones! I use them to listen to music 10 hours a day, and I walk around, use them at the gym, have a commute on the subway every morning, and back every night, I DJ, etc... the list goes on and on. None of the headphones I have ever purchased, with the exception of the HD-25's, felt like they could take the abuse I put them through, and they didn't!

I look for a few things when buying in-ears;
1) Durability - this is the #1 factor on my list, and it's why I LOVE my HD25's - they feel indestructible.
2) Comfort - As I said, I wear these for 10 hours a day, so comfort is key.
3) Sound Quality - Obviously, sound quality is important. What is most important to me is a balanced, crisp, sound that isn't overly colored.
4) Sound Isolation - I like to shut out the world and do work, or work out, so I basically want to hear no outside sound. Active sound-canceling is bulky, overly expensive, and needs a battery (lord knows I don't need another battery to worry about).

Alright so now on the the meat;
1) Durability - 5
With the SE315's...I finally feel like I've found a pair of headphones that are going to last me forever. Why? Because it was never the drivers that crapped out on my old headphones, it was always the cable! The SE315s solve this problem in such a simple manner; Detachable cables! Not only that but the cable feels like it could take a beating as it is, but even if it doesn't, I'll just throw them out and replace them for around $20-$30 bucks. That's a much better deal that $200-300 for a new pair of headphones. I have only had these for a month now, but so far, so good. I will continue to update if anything comes up.

2) Comfort - 3.5 to 4 with a caveat
Ok, so out of the box, figuring out how to actually put the headphones on was a bit different since the design is so radically different from any other in-ear I have ever used. Once you get used to it, the cable can still be a bit of an annoyance but overall the ""wrap around"" design is awesome. It prevents these earbuds from ever falling out, especially at the gym, or when I'm bouncing around during a DJ set. The way they designed these to fit in your ear is awesome, it just may take a while to get used to for some.

Now, the stock tips weren't very comfortable for me, which is normal for almost all earbuds I have purchased. Luckily the Comply T-100 aftermarket foam tips I used on my x7i's were a perfect fit. Now the comfort level of these is a 5. I guess after spending $200 I'd hope to not have to spend more money on aftermarket tips but I think it's the fact that I became so used to the Comply's after using them with my x7i's that I'll chalk it up to that.

In terms of sleeping with these - I can't fall asleep with headphones in period, but I can say that laying on my side with these in, listening to music in bed or laying on the couch, they were decently comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than anything else I've used. Still, I'd hate to give a full opinion because I simply will not sleep with headphones in or lay down for extended periods of time (Max 1 Hour, but typically much less).

3) Sound Quality - 4
Alright, I see a lot of people here hating on the sound quality. I will compare these to my HD-25's which I believe are one of the best headphones for the money out there, and the Klipsch x7i's. They are all around the same price so I believe it's a fair comparison. Again, I AM NOT AN AUDIOPHILE. For my purposes (DJing, Producing, daily listening) these headphones blow my x7i's out of the water. Kick for Kick, High Hat for High Hat, every sound is so much more crisp and detailed than the x7i's that I can't believe I spent $180 on them and that people compare them favorable to the Shures. The Shures have better dynamic range and separation between different instruments. Against the HD25's, I'd say they are on par or better, with the 25's having better bass response (that's just natural given the fact that they are over-ear drivers) and slightly better sound-staging. Then again, I can't wear my HD25's for more than an hour or so at a time before the head-clamping becomes bothersome and I start to sweat. The reason I give sound quality a 4 is because I'm sure the SE535's and 425's have better quality and better dynamics given the fact that they are multi-driver ear-buds, but they are also more expensive!!

4) Sound Isolation - 10/5 (yep, that's right, 10 out of 5)
I'm typing this from a plane right now listening to some soft deep-house, and I can't hear anything except my music, which is at normal listening volume...Not much more to say than that.

Conclusion:
These are amazing headphones. You certainly won't regret your purchase! If you want the best value, I would say you may like the 215's more. I would certainly say try both. I don't know if the 315's are worth $100 more, but they were worth $200 to me and are truly great headphones! I would certainly buy these again (but I don't think I'll ever have to! Unless I lose them, knock on wood!)"
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I own some more costly, ""higher end"" IEMs than this one, like the Sennheiser IE80 and the Westone W4r, both of which I purchased after buying the 315's. But I still like to listen to the Shure SE315's sometimes. The midrange is phenomenal... You can really hear all the nuances of a singer's voice. I love the fit and sound isolation these give... I think it's much better than either the IE80s or the Westones. Sometimes after not using the Shures for a while I put them on a get a huge smile. They still sound great, even though they were inexpensive. They have their own unique sound. Maybe it's just the Shure house sound, supposedly mid-centric and highly resolving. Because they fit so snugly and surely, I mainly use these for excercise and activity now, like while washing the car. Is the bass lacking, as others have said? Well, the bass is there, and it's tight and honest, but it won't floor you. All in all, I'm glad I have these."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR - Sounds soft. High end is extremely lacking.

These have great, smooth bass and mids and both are fairly clean. They are missing the high end though. The full presentation is extremely laid back. Details are present to some degree, but the overall sound is just soft. I had hoped that switching to the silicone tips would help improve that, but it didn't. There is little or no bass bloat at least. They are well refined as well. Since my main criteria for review here is sound quality and cost, I give these a firm 2 star based on the overall refinement and lacking treble being the only major draw back in the sound. I must emphasize the ""major"" part of that because it is terribly lacking. I have several sets of IEMs ranging from $30 to $100 that sound better.

Build quality is great. Third star for that. They seem sturdy and removable cables are always beneficial. The problem is that the SE215 that costs much less has the same build quality and sound quality that is on par or better by all reports (I haven't actually heard them). Third star gone. You're getting the same build quality and arguably better sound quality for ~2x the money. It's not worth it. Save up for the 535s instead or look at something other than Shure."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure sounds great. Been rockin' the the discontinued 310's for like 7 years or something. Had to send em in once and pay to get the cable repaired and it began to fray again recently

so I checked out the new models and they made some great improvements: the cables disconnect, so i don't have to send in the new unit, would gladly purchase a new cable as needed.

They are also lower profile than my previous buds, it's spring so I haven't tested, but I have no doubt they will be much comfier with a beanie or hat on the bike or on the slopes.

I wear these headphones quite a bit, up to two hours a day most days out of the week. These 315s are pretty comfy for the most part, takes a lil tweaking to find the sweet spot and proper fit. They block a lot of noise, even more so with a portable amp. But you can still pick up deeper sounds so I still feel pretty safe cruising through traffic on the bike in em.

I don't know all the nuances of audiophyllic analysis, but FLACs and 320s sound beautiful and you are guaranteed to discover so many more dimensions to your favorite tunes if you have never invested this much money in your mobile music experience before. Great highs when your getting all sophisticated with it, awesome deep bass when you wanna go all gangsta wid it."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first pair of top tier in earphone and all I can tell you is I'm so pleased with my purchase. Just be very careful when changing the ear insert, by mistake I broke my right piece but was able to get it back without any music lost. Still one of the best sounding in earphones. The four stars is for the build quality, again I broke the tip trying to change the ear insert but was able to get it back with a little ""JB WELD"".."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these over a year ago (Sept 2012). They are still working great! I've had absolutely no problems with them. I've gone through at least 5 different high-end headphones over the past two years and they are my favorite thus far.

I primarily use them for two things:

1) I work on my computer. Because I spend so much time on it I need good headphones to jam out to music for a good portion of my day. These headphones have a fantastic range and I have no complaints when listening to classical music with beautiful highs or heavy dub-step with crazy lows. Whether in an office or at a coffee shop, they work perfectly

2) Whether doing INSANITY at my house or going and lifting they stay in my ear and work perfectly for my exercise habits. They're not technically ""noise canceling"", but good luck hearing anything with them in.

Pros:
Very comfortable.
GREAT range and depth
Cord is replaceable(detachable) and is ridiculously strong/thick.
'Musicians grade' earphones.
great durability - Going a year strong
Love the case they come in, I put the headphones in them when I'm done to keep them safe.
Again, they are not technically ""noise canceling"". But I 'shure' can't hear anything with them in.
!! Little to no bleed through. People CANNOT hear what I'm listening to!!

Cons:
Expensive
No microphone.

Overall: highly recommend them over the competition. The bottom line on the price? You get what you pay for..."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a pair of 215s. Not worth the money. I'm a bit of an audiophile who needs noise isolation and enjoys high quality. There is MAYBE a negligible improvement. Maybe. But not worth the sacrifice in noise isolation due to the open porting. If I could do it all over again, I'd buy the 215s again, save $100, have the same audio quality (maybe even better bass response), and better noise isolation."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking for a good pair of in-ears for live stage performance at an affordable cost then these are the ones for you.

I've been using these for a little over a month now and I am very happy with their performance. I play drums in a band and the bass port makes them very good for drummers in my opinion.

There is a lot of noise playing in a drum booth, but these in-ears do a great job isolating everything but what they're putting out AS LONG AS you find the right pair of gels that fit your ear. It took me a few tries before finding the ones that fit my ears perfectly so be patient.

I especially like the fact that they come in clear, as I like them to be practically invisible to the audience."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is a solid 4.5
The base it’s not the greatest.
However there is NO mic.
The cable it’s horrible to put on.
And there is the price at $200
For me these are 4 star headphones."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to experiment with different ""non-Shure"" tips. I find the Comply TX-100 and the Etymotic ER38-14F (both available at amazon) help make a good seal in my ear that isolates the sound. I still find it a little tricky to put in, ie take my glasses off, figure out which side/direction in each ear, get the stiff part of the cable around the top of my ears etc. There's not much ""margin of error"" allowed from a good sounding fit, to sounding really awful. If the seal is the tiniest bit off, your $200 headphones will sound like a transistor radio with a weak battery.

But once they're in properly they sound great, but I prefer my Etymotic HF5 for sound isolation if I'm somewhere I want to get them in and out fast. So I use the Ety's for more ""active"" use (walking, hiking, gym) and the Shure SE315's for home use when I'm going to be relaxing & listening to music for awhile (plus the Shure's are more prone to pop-out/unseal with active use). I also have Bose SIE2's which are nice, but not as sound isolating. As far as audio quality I'd say these Shure's win out of all, then the Ety HF5's, then the Bose. I should also mention these Shure's are very efficient with power - ie the volume setting required (for the same loudness in my ears) is much lower, maybe 3/10 versus 7/10 for the Ety's/Bose's. So watch your volume settings on your computer/receiver/MP3 player!"
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through at least 20 pair of headphone looking for a quality set the I could use for workouts and on frequent plane rides. For a few years I was happy with the Sony MDR-EX71. The spilt line and offset wire design was great! But the build quality and sound quality just didn't cut it. After replacing them 3 times for the same connection failure I bit the bullet and spend some extra money on the Shure headphones. I was not disappointed.

These are incredibly comfortable. I use the medium foam tips. The block out most other sound and hold in place very well. For workouts I have never had a problem with them tugging off like most headphones. I would still prefer an offset cord. The double cord under the chin is not very comfortable.

Sound quality is balanced. If you are used to lower end headphones that are biased for more bass, these will take some time to get used to. But you will recognize the clarity improvements immediately.

The most striking feature on these headphones is their build quality. The cords are thick but flexible. They have very well designed strain reliefs the input jack and Y-connection, which many other manufacturers neglect. The rod to headphone connection is strong. I love that the design allows for you to replace a worn set of cords without having to throw out the expensive drivers. Why are all headphone not made this way? Oh, right....these cost 6 times the amount my last set did. Worth it."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these after several good years with the Etymotic Research ER-4PT. Both are great buds, but I like these slightly better.

Pros:
-Unbelievably good sound, even at low volume
-GREAT sound isolation with foam tips
-Flexible over-the-ear cable takes the weight and pull of cables off the ear canal (especially good for when cable gets caught on something)
-Replaceable cable is easy to switch, means you don't have to send your phones back for repairs
-Offers custom fit tips available from Sensaphonics (I haven't tried these, they're like an additional $150)

Cons:
-The bendable over-the-ear part of the cable looses it's stiffness after 6-9 months (causing the cables to be loose over the ears, which can be uncomfortable)
-Variety of ear tips is good, but they're not as comfortable for sensitive ears as the Etymotic yellow foam tips. (I find the Shure M foam tip too small, L too large)
-Tips get uncomfortable after about 3-4 hours

I use these for studying and for subway commuting, and sometimes just for noise isolation. They really cut down on ambient noise, and allow for relatively quiet listening even in loud environments, which I love. A few cons, but they're just nitpicks. These are so good that I don't see any reason to ever look for anything better. Bought my wife a pair, and while she's not an audiophile, she loves them nearly as much as I do! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been playing around with buying cheap earphones for awhile and the last run of purchases I got tired of having to repeatedly put them in my ears. So when I got my iTouch 4G I decided to upgrade my earphones as well. The Diddy Beats/Dr. Dre beats I didn't like the look of them and from what I heard, they also had a lot of bass in them. Which lead me to believe that they weren't balanced.

Shure SE315 got my attention because they were between the high end SE535 and SE110. $500 is a lot more than what I want to spend on a pair of earphones. So I went with the newer model.

Fit is most unusual but it works. I use earplugs a lot and is accustom to the feel. It took several tries to figure out how the SE315 works around my ear and how I like to carry my iPod. But after wearing them for a few hours I forgot they were in.

Sound. I wasn't sure if I would like the sound or if there would be any difference between the Shure SE315 vs my $5 Sony earphones. I like that the SE315 feel balanced in sound and there is some thickness in the bass especially when listening to Hip Hop music. I'm a music lover so this was important for me to find a pair of headphones that enhances the sound of my music collection

Isolating. These things ROCK!!! Cleaning the house, using the vacuum, or anything that's noisy these definitely block the sound out. But it gets better. I can actually hear the music loud and clear. The volume does not have to be turned all the way up.

Only problem I see is that I have to keep them clean. Even when I don't have them in my ear. Dust collects on them pretty fast. Also the cord gets twisted some times around and the connector comes out of my iPod due to the case that I have around it.

Price is not too bad considering that you have a thick Kevlar cord. The ear piece fits inside your ear not sticking out like most earbuds.

Overall I am happy with my purchase. I will never go back to buying cheap earbuds. I give them 4 stars only because of price."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones needs a bit getting used to. I finally used the triple flange ear plugs and now the sound is spectacular. I realized that one needs to create a closed volume of air by using whatever adapter works best for you. As you position the earphones you will notice the sound quality change. You will have to find the right position for your ear. The molded wires can be made into a loop to go over the ear. I have the 5 feet wire one and the sound is fantastic
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are superb!! I was really hesitant about buying $200 in-ear phones over an over-the-ear model like Bose. But this model is definitely worth the price. I can barely hear any outside noise with these bad boys in and the expandable earbuds really lock in for a good fit. One thing I do notice is that I have to compress the expandable earbuds really thoroughly to get a good fit so that I can hear more bass from songs. But that isn't a problem, just an observation/tip."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a friend's pair for a week and was even more impressed with the new pair I rec'd. Its clear why these are selling so well after so many years. The comfort and sound are top notch and will serve me for years. I bought them to wear on stage but I think they will get even more use than that. The sound is balanced and the bass is there but not overwhelming and I like that. There are other companies making great in ears, but these don't take a backseat to any."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been on something of a quest to find decent earphones, since foolishly parting with my Shure e2c's. The rundown so far: Sennheiser CX200,Klipsch IMAGE S4,Bose IE2,Etymotic HF5,Monster Turbine,Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10, and Shure SE425 have all been run through my Zune, iPod Classic, and Yamaha receiver. So, a wide range of models, on a reasonable range of devices.

Right off the bat, I have to say that I have some bias toward having the speaker wires over my ears. My old e2c's were reinforced to bend around my ear, and I totally loved that. And to date, Shure seems to be the only company around who acknowledges that as a legitimate way to wear earphones. The SE315's are no exception, molding very well around my ears, reducing the rustling sound from a moving wire.

The overall fit of the 315's is excellent. The engineering on this is worthy of a premium price in itself. The speakers themselves don't protrude from my ears, and the above-mentioned wiring is rather discrete. The tubes are a perfect depth, and the foam tips are comfortable enough to wear all day while blocking out the rest of the world. I really don't think I could ask for more on the fit, and the 315's blow away every model I've tried.

And sound quality? It's great. Highs and mids are bright and clear enough that you can pick up loads of detail, but without sounding shrill or succumbing to clipping. I'm hesitant to say they sound ""natural"", so much as ""tuned for recorded music"". (For truly ""natural"" sound, consider the SE425's) On the low end, the SE315's are a huge mixed bag. If you're expecting to listen to Jay-Z and make your head vibrate with bass, these aren't for you (check out the Monster Turbines for that). That's not to say that bass is entirely absent. It's there, and it's actually quite accurate. Listening to songs from Detroit Grand Pubahs and Shiny Toy Guns, there's a lot of detail on the low side that I just didn't notice before. Similarly, the SE315's bring just the right amount of warmth and depth if you're listening to Dave Brubeck or Scala, but on a track like Tom's Diner by Suzanne Vega, you hear the bass line -- but you don't ""feel"" it at all. It's a strange sensation.

If you're looking for something particular from your earphones (e.g. lots of bass, absolutely crystal-clear reproduction, overly-pronounced mids, etc.) the SE315's are going to be a compromise in one area or another, or just flat-out wrong for you. But overall, I'd have to say that the SE315's are the best earphones I've used in this price range. Without spending literally twice as much money, you'd be hard pressed to find earphones that are this good all-around."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking to venture into the world of IEMs, these are a great pair to start with. Though the drivers aren't nearly as good as those in higher end monitors, they're a nice place to start. My only real complaint with these is that after about a year, of weekly use (2-3 times a week in a live band setting), one of the ears would short out and because of that I've gone through at least 5 pairs of these. I would buy them through Guitar Center with a replacement plan so instead of paying full price, I was only paying about $30 for a new pair. I've since moved on to custom molded IEMs, but I still have these as a back up pair."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
1) Isolation you could potentially use to sleep through noisy environments
I travel long distances quite often and these headsets provide great noise isolation. If you're on a noisy bus or train and wear these, you can block out around 80% of the sound. Put on music at 20% volume (I use a Google Nexus 4) and you can be oblivious to your environment. Sure, that can be a bad thing (for those who are driving or running but noise isolation isn't meant for those people anyway)
Often, I don't want to listen to music but sleep in peace while travelling. I put these in and sleep without even connecting them to another device

2) Comfort
IEMs aren't perfect but these are the most comfortable I've ever worn. Long hours without a problem with the right sized bud. The shape is weird to put in the first 2-3 times but there are plenty of tutorials to see learn. Check YouTube. Once in, they are super comfortable and the earbuds are flat on the outside helping you sleep or lie down while travelling.

Cons:
1) Bass (or lack there of)
If you're a bass head, DON'T GET THIS. You like listening to vocals or pure precursion instruments, get these. With a bit of EQ, you wouldn't mind.
I think I have a good ear but I never had a problem with the eq push for bass though one of my friends did say he didn't like the eq push (not sure if it was psychological).

2) Memory wire is a bit weird at times
Not a major issue but it's kinda weird the way the memory wire around the headset behaves. You get used to it though over time

Who would you recommend this product to?
If you like listening to classical, good vocals or you don't mind the slight EQ push and want something for traveling, this could be the one you're looking for!

After using these for over 2 years, I highly recommend it :)"

Shure makes these readily available, which tells me that it's a know issue, but a revenue stream for the planned obsolescence of a poor quality cables.

5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these because I play drums (death metal) and I trigger my kick drum. In terms of isolation and feedback they are great. Their bass is noticeably lacking but for me that's not an issue because I play fast enough that too much bass would be impossible to discern. A great feature is their ""moldable"" wires for over the ear. Another is that they come with several different sets of earbuds so you'll definitely find one you like.

However, after roughly a year and a half of regular use with great care I experienced cable rot as other users have mentioned. As this was within the limited two year warranty I had no problem getting them fixed and they extended the warranty by a month which would be Nov 2016. Now halfway through December, the ear assembly no longer makes proper connection with the cable most likely due to their decision to incorporate a 360 degree swivel.

I cannot knowingly recommend these headphones to someone knowing that they will break within two years at this pricepoint even though they've come down 20% since I bought them.

I would probably have given them 4 to 4.5 stars had the cable never broken as poor sound was more of an inconvenience in my use case.

Biggest complaint? Only one... build quality. It appears Shure have sorted the mechanicals to last a little longer than 1 year, but the cable rot issue is quite frankly awful. The 3 year warranty is great & helps, and Shure are very quick to respond and fix any issues. But for such a simple issue you have to ask why can't they fix it??

0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially, I was very disappointed when I bought these SE315-K's - for the sole factor that they, literally, didn't sound like they were worth my hard earned $200. I have had them for two months now, and gosh was I wrong about these Shure headphones. Once you figure out the right sleeve that works best for you, and to put the SE's on correctly- so they can fit comfortably for hours, you will be entirely content, presumably. I've been listening to music (metal, progressive metal) not-stop with these headphones and with great joy and enthusiasms, you'll inevitably hear a distinction in the great audio quality.

Now for the drummers whom are looking for a good, decent pair of isolation headphones: these headphones will definitely assist you with jamming along songs, comfortably. No need to turn-up the volume to whatever you're going to plug these into. Most importantly, these headphones will protect your hearing. Also, something I've picked up along the way is that, when I don't tune my drums, in other words, I'm too lazy to, by wearing these headphones, your drums automatically sound tuned. Great sorcery, I tell ya'.

Update: November 23rd 2016 (Three years later)

Well, I am not happy at all. I was stoked when I first initially purchased these headphones back in late 2013. Then, that $200 hefty price tag was a lot for me, but I overlooked the price tag due to my initial positive impressions on the product. Boy was I wrong. A few months after I purchased the headphones, one of the drivers began creating background static. Luckily, the headphones were still warranted; so I sent them in for repair. Now, it's 2016 and earlier this year, the headphones began anew issue. I have to constantly move and wiggle around the headphones to avoid any static/crackling being produced. Sure, I can send them to SHURE for repair, but paying extra cash for repairs for an already expensive piece of tech- that prematurely is causing problems- shouldn't be even be the case to begin with. Now, I don't even use these anymore. They're just hung-up with my other unused headphones collecting dust.

If a SHURE Representative comes across this review and would like to lend me a hand, I would greatly appreciated. Until then, I will sadly be an unsatisfied SHURE customer with crushed hopes."

2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"But not even a year since I bought them, the right earpiece keeps flaking out. I'm guessing there's bad wiring somewhere"
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely take the time to stop and review anything but after reading some of the reviews on here and listening to these headphones I felt the need to be heard. I am admittedly an audio snob and might skimp on a lot of things, but my sound quality is not one of them. Since I was young I have always used the best headphones I could afford. Before the days of earbuds this was a top notch pair of studio headphones but for every day life, large cumbersome speakers on your head are not practical. This always spoiled me to today's sacrifice of quality for convenience music.

I have never been able to listen to less than 256kbps MP3s, the loss of quality irks me. In the days before MP3s I splurged on Ultra disks when they were released and today I prefer lossless conversions to convenience. I can't even use my iPhone for my MP3 player because the sound quality difference between the iPhone and iPod is too much for me. Enough about my snotty... I mean snobbiness.

I have had and adored my Shure E2s for many, many years until the cord rot finally got the best of them. The sound quality was amazing and the fit was the best I had ever had for my ear. Normal earbuds never fit my small ears, not that I ever gave them much of a chance because the sound quality was so bad. I have three small mouths to feed and forking over $200 for a set of earphones was a big deal to me even with my discerning tastes. I have to say that I have no buyer's remorse whatsoever.

Fit and Comfort

The fit of these is very awkward at first, though I found the same pretty true for my E2s. While the E2s took less time to initially get situated the reinforced cord does make these a bit more awkward. Once I was able to get them just right and molded over my ear it was easier to put them back in. I still have somewhat of a ""seal"" issue with my left ear but I have yet to try all the many, many available different earpieces. My ears are a little small for the large shape of the earbud itself. I have some very slight discomfort where the back touches the rim of my ear. I found some slight discomfort initially with my E2s as well but that after some time my ears get used to them being there and this would go away. I have not owned these long enough to develop ""ear calouses"". This also impedes my ability to enjoy the ""pillow comfort"" many of the other reviewers experience. None of this is enough to make me take them down a star.

Build Quality

By far the best feature of these headphones is the replaceable cord, and it is much of what you are paying for. As every Shure lover has undoubtably found the cord rot is just heartbreaking. Since my last set of Shures freyed over my ears, I am happy to see this area have the reinforced and stiffer cable. The earbud itself is very well built and I experienced none of the previous reported issues with the connection from the cable to the earbud itself. I had no twisting or any problems at all.
The cord is long enough to allow you ample ability to carry your music player in your pocket and not have to worry about any tugging. The jack also has a better build. I had problems with my previous Shure's jack, I am less concerned about that occuring with this set. I did test out the previous poster's complaint about the iPhone and the case and they were spot on. If you have a hard case on your iPhone you can forget about these headphones staying put. I had no issue with connectivity or sound but the jack would fall right out if I moved at all. This was not a problem on my iPod with a silicone case. It seemed that it was the thick hard case that caused me issue and I was unwilling to drill it out to fit as I am not a fan of music on my iPhone anyway.

Sound Quality

I am not sure what others are complaining about with the sound quality. The bass on these headphones is much improved and does not overpower the music. They are well balanced for anyone looking to listen to music and not bass. I agree with previous posters about these headphones being mid-heavy but I hear so much more of the rest of the music that I had never heard before I might almost be distracted from the lyrics if this were not the case. I really haven't listened to music like this (outside of my car or home stereo) since I started using an MP3 player. I also found that adjusting my EQ helped with some of the balance issues. I tested boosting the bass on my iPod and the music was muddied, so just as everyone else stated if you want to blow your eardrums with bass these are not the headphones for you. Other than that the quality of these is stellar, I don't want to watch TV anymore or ever stop listening to music. It is like hearing it all again for the first time. That being said these are pretty close in sound quality to a solid $100-$150 pair of headphones, you are paying the extra money for the extra features provided in the build quality and the replacable parts. If you are like me and will use a product until every last part replacement fails then you will make a good investment in these earbuds.

Finally, the price on these from Amazon was a full $50 better than anywhere else and with Prime they arived super fast. I can't complain at all about my purchase... ok maybe I could but then I would really just be whining to hear myself whine."

Unfortunately, i am also sure they are over my budget. These are the most comfortable clearest sounding earphones I have ever used. Mind you, I've been through about 20 different ones. I had my first set for a little over 2 years until my dog decided that they were her chew toy. I immediately purchased another set of the exact same ones. The SE315! Thank you SHURE for putting out a fantastic product."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have only had these for a little while and the left ear bud is already blown and distorted upset cause i paid 200.00 dollars for them and now i'm having to buy another pair but not the same model.
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the past year, I had been using a pair of Monster Turbine In-Ear Speakers (one of the very few Monster products that isn't actually over-priced). However, towards the end of its life, I started noticing some sound interruption in the right channel. Considering the Turbines had extremely thin and delicate looking cables, I'm surprised they lasted as long as they did. Anyways, it was time for me to hit the earphone market again.

Ever since I graduated beyond the generic buds bundled with MP3 players, I have had to cry myself to sleep way too often when a brilliant pair of earphones is rendered useless by a ruined cable. I decided I'd had enough of that and was determined to get one with replaceable cables this time around. Having also used the Shure SCL2 in the past, I was well-aware of the sound signature of Shures and decided that the new member to my family would be a Shure. From there on, the decision was easy and made mostly by my wallet. The Shure SE535s (triple-driver), and Shure SE 425s (dual driver) weren't too friendly with my I-spent-way-too-much-money-on-booze-last-weekend-so-now-I'm-a-broke-college-student wallet, so the Shure SE 315s were the logical choice for me.

Before I get down to reviewing the product, you should know this review is based off of about 3-5 hours of listening. I haven't had the chance to burn them in yet, and once I have logged about 200 or so hours of usage, I will come back to update my review. These are some of the songs I sampled immediately after receiving my earphones. In my opinion, these songs together brilliantly cover all ranges from the lows to the highs - Staralfur (Sigur Ros), Archaic Patterns (Eno), Let the Drummer Kick (Citizen Cope), 21 Guns (Green Day) and Intensity in Ten Cities (Chiodos).

Mids and Highs:

Reproduction of mid and high frequencies on the SE 315s are pristine, impeccable and flawless (at least to my ear. I have a discerning ear, but cannot claim to be an audiophile). You know how people always claim to have `heard things in a song they had never heard before' ? I now know what they've been talking about. In songs like Staralfur (Sigur Ros), Intensity in Ten Cities and Archaic Patterns it was beautiful. Also for the first time, I am seriously considering completely making the switch to lossless formats. I generally hover around 192 kbps to 224 kbps when ripping my discs, but once again, for the first time it seems I can hear the flaws. I'm definitely going to rip some of my CDs in FLAC and sample them with these earphones.

Bass:

Undoubtedly, bass reproduction in these instruments is on the lower side. I do realize to expect improvements once they are past the burning in phase, but even then, I expect them to be a little conservative when it comes to bass. Now, for me this wasn't a problem. After spending an year with the Monster Turbines, I got my fix of bass. Initially, it felt really good - the strong, thumping bass. After a while, it started getting on my nerves a little bit because the bass on them used to overpower delicate mids and highs. Thus, I was looking for earphones that took it easy on the bass and thus the SE 315s suit me perfectly. However, realize that if you are a bass junkie, and need to feel the thump in your ears, these probably aren't meant for you. The bass reproduction on these is light. The thump and the kick of the bass exist, but is never overpowering. The quality of reproduction of bass on the SE 315s fall somewhere in between my previous earphones, the Monster Turbines, and my current headphones, the Grado SR 60i. The 215s don't have overpowering, shallow bass, yet the bass is nowhere as roomy, deep and true as my Grado's. Not a fair comparison though as the Grados, by merit of being open-air, are bound to have a much wider soundstage.
Be well aware of this before making the purchase. For many, music is no fun without strong bass, and for those people I would strongly recommend Monster's line of earphones.

Cables and Fit:

One of the greatest pros for these earphones is the user-replaceable cables. Thus I feel they deserve a section of their own.
The cable length is generous, extending to about 6 feet. Ample length to reach to the player in your pocket and have some room so as not to tug on it.
The earphones are meant to be worn over the ear so that the cord loops around your ear and suspends the earphones into your ear. It is comfortable to wear them that way so much so that when I made the shift from my Shure SCL 2 to the Monsters, I continued wearing them over the ear. It gives a certain measure of protection to the cable so that if you accidentally tug on the cable, the part where it attaches to the earphones does not get strained.
The part of the cable that goes around your ear has a coating of a certain material that makes them very stiff and moldable. The point of that is so you shape them to your ear and they remain that way. However, the initial fit can be quite frustrating and time consuming. When I put them on for the first time, it took me a good 20min to get it into my ear and get a good seal. Subsequently, it won't take you more than about 15-20sec, which is still more than usual earphones. However, the excellent sound quality your ear receives afterwards makes it worth the trouble.

Packaging:
Finally, I conclude with packaging. Nothing much to write here except that the box the earphones is sold in surprisingly needs to be torn to open them. The box is sealed with a rather strong adhesive and in the process of opening it, even though I tried to be gentle in case I felt the need to return them, I ended up tearing the box. I wonder if that would be a problem with Amazon should you feel the need to return. Be patient and gentle while opening the box.
The earphones come with a huge collection of ear buds, earwax cleaner and a very nice earphone carry case. Use it, it's good for the earphones.

Conclusion:
These are great earphones. They definitely don't come cheap, and I wouldn't say there aren't better alternatives in the market at the same price point, however the replaceable cables actually makes them a much better long term investment. You would not want to purchase expensive earphones only to have to discard them an year later due to a faulty wire.
Fitting and wearing these will take a lot of getting used to, however, the seal is excellent and sound isolation is amazing too. Once again, mids and highs are stellar, bass is definitely underpowered so keep that in mind too.

Update:
About 3-4 days into using these earphones I started noticing some stuttering / cutting of audio in the right channel. Seems like the cable or the connection at the earphone was loose. Anyways, I've requested a replacement from Amazon, and its on its way. Mistakes happen, defects slip through even the strictest QA and Amazon's speedy response more than makes up for it. Won't be deducting a star for this."

3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second shure ear bud, and it's the second time the right ear bud stopped working basically as soon as the warranty period was over. I did like the sonic characteristics but beware of longevity."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought that these in ear monitors were going to blow the competition out of the water but even after giving it a week for them to ""break in"" they sounded almost exactly like the apple ear pods from the iPhone 6 and i compared them extensively. Yes, the shure earphones do perform better in the lows and hear the audio more clearly without it being mudded together but for the price you pay for them i do not feel that the slight audio improvement is worth 200 dollars which is why i have sent them back for a refund and ordered the shure se535 which will hopefully be a better audio experience that is well worth the asking price."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had high expectation from the reviews, but in the end find it a bit lacking:

1) Sound quality: mid and highs are indeed very good, sound stage is broad and clear. But base is weak, simply lack the punch and resonance compare to many other earphones.

2) Build quality: not as good as I hoped. The wires are a bit rigid, somewhere between rubber and plastic, and there is even some manufacturing artifact attaching to it. In comparison, Sony's smooth, grooved-surface wires obviously feel better.

3) Sound isolation is really good, but the factory-installed foam (mid-size) is too big, make my ear painful after hours of wearing. And it is so hard to replace the foams, nearly impossible without extra tools and extra care.

4) Convenience: those behind-ear wearing style is always awkward, especially with shure 315k, you have to pinch the earphone piece in the right angel to insert into your ears, then make the wire go behind your ears. It takes me at least 20 seconds to put it on, and that's after many practices..."

7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure customer for years now. I bought a pair of E2C-N's in July of 2008. I work in a laboratory with humming machines and I travel on planes often enough that I felt it wise to invest in some sound isolating gear. I did some research online and found that in-ear phones will isolate sound much more effectively (for the price) than over the ear headphones. At the time I was purchasing, Shure only had a few models on Amazon, the E2's E3's and E4's. Because I was not sure how I would like this new technology I purchased the cheaper E2's for $68.80. I was wary about this type of device because many users felt that it hurt their ears and claimed to not be able to wear it while working out.

However, the E2's arrived quickly and I remember taking a lot of time putting it in my ear and fitting it, and because I kept trying different ear pieces it did start to hurt. When I did get them in my ear, I could not hear a thing! The hum of the machines was gone, and for the first time I sat in my laboratory in complete silence. It was very exciting! Next I turned on my Ipod. Wow! The music was so clear and loud that I first had to turn the volume way down. I felt that I was really hearing my music for the first time, clearly with no background noise. It was such an amazing experience that I got goosebumps!

The reviews for the E2's said that many people could not wear them while working out, I had no issues. Many said that the device had functioning issues, I had none. Many said that the cables broke after hard use, I had no problems. I used it for two years almost everyday, in the lab, shoved in my purse, while working out, shoved in a gym bag, stepped on, sat on, rolled over with my office chair, and worked out with. I was very lucky and had no problems whatsoever.

In July of 2010 my E2's were stolen from my hotel room while I was at a conference. Since then I again did a massive search for a replacement. The E2's have gone up in price since 2008, and I doubt they are making more of them now. I did not see the point in buying headphones for almost twice the price I paid in 2008, not when there are newer and better models out there. After researching extensively, I though the SE315's seemed to have the most positive reviews (by people who seem to be very knowledgeble about the product) for the price. I am also one of those people who really believe in getting the latest updated technology, and was very excited to be getting these headphones.

I bought them from Amazon in October 2010 for $199. The updates in these compared to the E2's:

*improved ear bud sleeves

*rotating connector to ear bud (to make replacement of defective pieces easier)

*flexible around ear piece to keep wire in place over ear

*Maybe better sound?

However I found problems with all these updates:

*Ear bud sleeves are pretty much the same and they give you less orange squishy sleeves and more of these new foamy balck ones (which absorb ear wax like a sponge EWWW)

*The rotating piece keeps rotating and rotating making the device hard to get a grip on and get it into your ear. Previoulsy I could get the E2's in my ear with one hand in no time at all, these I have to use two hands, pin back my hair, and push, and push it in, and finally when I get it in the ear, it pops out, or squirms around, or the ear bud is ok, but now the wire is contorted. Sometimes I can get it in, but my ear is sore after all the shoving, and it does not make a tight sound proof seal like the E2's did, even after I tried several sleeves. I can only assume that the defect is where the sleeve connects to the bud, letting noise come in.

*The pliable plastic sleeve around the wire near the bud has made it more difficult to put in, because if I try to first put that behind my ear and then put the bud in, it starts rotating around because of the rotating piece, and moving everywhere. Then I have this formed piece of plastic stuck in it's shape going everywhere while I am trying to put it in. Finally, I will have the device in, and then try to smooth the deformable plastic piece around my ear, and doing so loosens the earbud! The E2's had just the normal wire which was not so bendable, and was not perfect, but I do not think this plaible plastic is the solution either.

*The sound is tinny! I wish every reviewer here could directly compare the SE315's with something with bass. These are horrible! I cannot even listen to my music they have made everything sound terrible. This is a far cry from the goosebumps I got when I used my E2's to listen to music for the first time. I never understood how important bass is until it is not there anymore! I have tried to use the earphones for an extended time to get used to them (becuase I was hoping that would make me like them better) but the sound is so terrible I have to just stop. I tried adjusting the bass settings on my Ipod, and there is nothing that makes it better.

I was greatly looking forward to purchasing an updated and improved device because the E2's were not perfect. I could have gotten over the shortcoming's of the fit of the SE315's if it had good sound quality, which it does not. My regular headphones for $15 have better sound. I will sadly be returning these to Amazon and will purchase a now inflated E2 for $99. In the meantime I will use my $15 set of headphones and get much much better sound quality, if not sound isolation. If anyone has found an updated replacement for the E2's that have just as good sound, please write me a comment so I can get those."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones, because of their configuration, are very difficult to fit to the ear to optimize their sound quality, depth of bass, and resonance. Consequently, I am constantly moving them around to improve their clarity, bass, and expansion of treble, mid range, and bass. I have yet to achieve this, so the resulting sound is repressed and canny. The SE 315's also distort at higher volumes and lose overall sound quality. This sucks for me as I bought them primarily to use when I practice and prepare for a gig on my drums. You also can't change out the end pieces for improved ear fit without tearing them up."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the original chord that comes with these earphones do not have a built in mic despite what the specs say on the product page. That said, these are great earphones that have great sound quality and above average comfort. However, switching to the chord (ordered separately) that has the integrated mic renders these earphones basically equivalent to $20 standard iphone headphones. Any slight movements can be heard reverberating through the chord. I can actually hear the vibration of my typing as I write this review through the chord that is laying on the table on which the keyboard is also laying. Just slightly tilting my head to the side, as the chord moves along my shirt, I can hear the movement through the chord over the sound coming through the earphones. the original chord that came with the SE315 is great, but it lacks the mic. so there's no good way to listen to the SE315s with an integrated chord/mic solution."

The fitment was ok. The standard ear piece is like a memory foam type material which was nice. The earphones also came with a variety of ear pieces. So, fitment won't be an issue for the majority if not all of its users. The wiring right after the earbuds are bent. I don't know if it was a defect or if it's supposed to be like this. So, I had to adjust/turn them every time I had to use the earphones. Just a slight, minor inconvenience.

The sound was very crisp, but too ""treble"" for me. The bass was almost non-existant in my opinion. For those who love your bass, I would not recommend these earphones.

Overall, it was a nice set of earphones, but it did not justify the price and did not meet or exceed my previous set(Ludacris SL99).

1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is good, and the cable looks old. However, one thing is really annoying!!!! It 's almost impossible to remove the foam sleeves. I really hate it.

2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm really happy with these headphones, they sound great and they are really good at blocking outside noise."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I *really* wanted to like these earbuds, and they are a fine product with many good features, but ultimately they were not the best solution for me. As a working drummer I have been regularly gigging for the last five years, using Shure E2's exclusively. I've put up with the E2's deficient bass response and inevitable cable rot because they offer great isolation (essential for live drumming), they're affordable, and they fit me very well. The cable rot was an issue, the first time I encountered it, Shure's truly stellar customer service team replaced the entire units, even though they were about a month away from warranty expiration. I cut apart the brand-new set and immediately put heat-shrink tubing over the wires to prevent them from rotting. Why Shure can't fix such a simple problem, I don't know.

I was hoping that they had addressed the lack of bass and the cable rot with the new SE315's. It appears that their solution to the cable rot is to make a replaceable cable. I was skeptical about the quality of the connector used at that location, but it appears to be quite robust. I rotated and flexed them around while listening, and detected no sign of an intermittent connection. Shure did improve the bass response noticeably, but unfortunately they seemed to have bumped up the midrange too, and that was the deal-breaker for me. I found them uncomfortable to listen to. This has always been a bit of a problem for me with the E2's also, they always seemed a little too hot in the midrange. I just assumed that it was because they were designed as stage monitors, and so it was important to hear the vocals above all else. When I fired up the SE315's and found that the midrange was even hotter, I made the sad decision to return them.

There was also a slight fit issue for me with the SE315's. The may have been trying to make them lower-profile, so they wouldn't protrude from your ears. Unfortunately these contact my FRONT ear lobe, in a way the E2's never did. After only about 20 minutes of wearing them, I was feeling some discomfort. Maybe over time I would adjust to this, but with the midrange issue I wasn't interested in finding out.

One other thing; When I first received the SE315's, they had the new foam-style pads installed. I am not a fan of any of the foam pads, I greatly prefer the silicone pads, they are way more comfortable, and most importantly go in and out of your ears almost instantly (a must for rehearsals). When I tried to take the foam pads off, it was VERY difficult. This was compounded by the fact that the tube is smaller diameter and seems much more fragile than the E2's. I was actually afraid I was going to break my brand-new buds, that's how bad it was. Not sure why they chose to downsize it, the E2's were fine, and seem a lot more rugged.

As it turns out, you can still get E2's, in the form of SCL2's (same thing), for about $100. That was the final nail in the coffin for the SE315's. I returned them and bought TWO pairs of the SCL2's with the money.

By the way, if you just want to listen to music and don't need the super high isolation, my go-to earbuds are Sony MDL-EX71's. I have not found any earbuds that I like as much as those, the sound is fantastic, the value is incredible, and they are all-day comfortable. In my opinion they sound better than the Shures. If they offered the isolation that the Shures do, I would use them live, but I have tried it and it does not work."

5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've previously owned other pairs of Shure earbuds and have been loyal to the company because I've experienced the quality of their products. However, owning this pair of earbuds has made me rethink my feelings toward Shure. I've now used these earbuds for almost a year. When they work, they work amazing. The sound is superb, the isolation is ideal. However, the detachable cables have been a major source of frustration. I've had to have them replaced 3 times now. They simply short out. A $200 pair of earbuds should outlast the cables of a $20 pair of earbuds. But worse is that Shure has made me pay to ship the defective cables back over and over. This last time they sent me the replacement cables the replacements came unusable and Shure again wanted me to pay to send those back. They wouldn't pay for shipping until I asked to talk to a supervisor and argue for 20 minutes.

9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very disappointed in these earphones. I wish I had sent them back right away. As others have stated, the sound balance is off. The upper middle range is way too high and there is no low end at all. For a singer that may be acceptable, but as a drummer playing an electronic set it is very frustrating. All I can hear of my bass drum is a click. Compared to the earbuds that came with my iPhone, these Shure earphones sound like junk. For the price, that is just not acceptable for me."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people rag on the sound quality of these headphones. However, I thoroughly enjoy them!! I listen to a lot of house/trance/piano and think that the base and high ends come through very well. Especially the vocals and intricate instruments in many tracks. Also, the form factor is killer."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd pair. Sound quality wise, these are excellent. Bass response is very good and the dynamic range excellent. So while they work - they're great. The issue is I've had to send both sets I bought back in for service because after about 6 months of use (granted at higher volume levels), the right earbud would start getting fuzzy. I cleaned it per Shure's guidance, but it was evident I blew out the speakers. 2 Pairs. Now, shure service was outstanding and fast. But two at this price range - I expected more."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I once wore these headphones on a cross-country flight, listening to music at a reasonable volume, and when we were about to land I took them off and realized there was a child screaming behind me. They aren't noise-canceling headphones but they're good enough to drown out screaming children on flights, so they're good enough for me.

They're also very comfortable - I can wear them for a full workday and they don't bother me. And the sound quality is amazing."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a set of UE Triple Fi 10's previously and while these aren't quite as bright and fluttery on the trebles they do alright up top. Maybe not for a basshead but they have enough of a low end punch for me if I click the volume up a bit. Excellent mids though. Comfort wise they're a big step up though. They fit in my ears nicely (much smaller than those honking TF10's) and the cable rests nicely over my ear and keeps them in place. I really like shure's ear-tips too. The olives are great; just as comfortable as any other foam tips I've ever used, but way way more durable (I'm looking at you comply!). Glad I chose this set!"
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. Love how they wrap around the back of the ear to fit securely. A slew of different options for the ear bud, to get as close to a custom fit as you can. Only problem is that the original foam buds from the factory are next to impossible to get off. Supposed to come of by twisting and pull at the same time, but it feels like you are going to pull the entire unit apart! Still have not gotten them off. Maybe with some additional wear, they will loosen up?"
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful sound. Lots of different foam / rubber / silicone buds to fit different ears. I found the yellow foam ones worked best for me. Love the cable that isn't a broken connector waiting to happen! I've gone thru several sets of Bose due to broken wires. These can be replaced. Takes a bit of effort to get them on - especially for my hands that are no longer young, let's say. Removing them also is enough of a pain that I find I'm reluctant to pop them out to have a conversation. The upside, though, is that they stay in my ears when I walk or get on/off transit during commute. Expensive but a very good product."

There are several high end makers, but Shure has a trusted and respected name and I started with a pair of the 215's. Great headphones! I upgraded to 315's after about 4 months and I've kept this pair and like them very much for all levels and types of music. I'll be a Shure fan for as long as they keep making this great product."

6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first time with sound isolation earphones. I bought these headphones just to wear at the gym and wear walking around... big mistake. Maybe it's just my sensitive ears, but when I make the recommended seal with these headphones, every internal movement of my body is loudly audible. When walking, every step produces a booming pressure wave in my ears. Even sitting at my desk the sounds emanating from the muscles in my neck were distracting. I figured out that if I creep the headphones halfway out of my ear and break the seal a bit, those noises are diminished enough to be able to stand them while only reducing the sound quality by about 20%. That aside, the sound isolation is outstanding, the sound quality is definitely there, and they are very comfortable. Highly recommended for plane travel or other loud environments, but that's about it."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I broke mine in for over 200 hours. I just left them pulled into my amp with a random selection of music. I check every few days and they seem to need more. I finally tried them and they are the best ear buds I've had.
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First: I consider myself a lover of music, movies and games with an extremely well trained ear (I can hear electrical currents in power adaptors that are out of sync, etc. - I know...weird.) so I feel I have a good basis to judge audio products on. I can tell you that for the $80 I paid, these headphones are delivering at least 3x that in value of audio quality in comparison to competitive products.

Second: I was a QA (Quality) intern at Shure when the first earbuds for non-musicians (consumer) were being developed and I was able to try many out in my spare time (I even have 2 pairs still that work great, some 12 years later).

Third: I have owned in the past:
- Sony Ear Wrap headphones (gym grade - meh - never use them anymore...ever)
- Shure pre-EC Prototypes (still working great)
- Shure EC2s (still working great)
- Shure SE310s (dead of a crappy chord failure near the 3.5mm jack at just over 2 years of life)

And most recently purchased Shure SE315s (horrible product - see my other review) at the same time as these Klipsch S4's to see which I'd keep. Needless to say, I just sent back the SE315s and am currently listening to my S4s while typing.

Pros:
- Excellent sound quality, well above many others out there

Cons:
- Price is way too high for sound quality (price per quality is probably 4x higher than the Klipsch S4's I'm using and very happy with)
- Product quality was far below expectation - I almost broke the ear tips taking off the foam plugs that came attached to the buds to try Shure's alternates
- Wires tangle quite easily, despite claims that they don't
- Earbuds are huge in comparison to my SE310s and are not comfortable at all
- Earbuds require over ear wrap and barely stay in/on no matter what I did

So overall - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!

I'm so disappointed with Shure on this one I just have no idea what else to say. I've been a huge advocate of them for 12 years now. But after what I'd call a premature (2 years) failure of the wire on my SE310s (always coddled and in a Shure hard case when not in use) that I'm going to enjoy my 3x less expensive Klipsch S4's and I suggest you do too."

2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I expect better quality for the money. I ordered them for travel and, due to a change of plans, they sat unused for a few months. Then, I pulled the headphones out on an overnight flight and found that they did not work from day one. I tried them on several different devices and they have all been intermittent. I was warned about Shure quality and should have listened."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR Version: Decent IEM's. Great build design, very secure comfortable fit (without glasses). Sound is decent, clarity is amazing, but very mid-range/vocal forward.

Let me start off by saying that everyone has a preconceived notion of how music ""should sound"" when they buy a pair of headphones. Especially when they pay over $100, especially $200. I wanted to love these headphones, but they just didn't have the sound signature I personally was looking for. For others, it could be exactly what they want

Sound: The clarity and detail of these headphones is what you are paying for. Nothing I played on these headphones sounded artificial or ""tinny"" at any point in my listening experience, which is very hard for any pair of IEM's to achieve. That being said, I was unimpressed with the sound signature of the headphones. I felt like everything was EQ'd toward the midrange, and to me the vocals of any music genre were always front and center over instruments, which was good sometimes, but bad in most cases. The high's were very natural sounding, definitely better than most IEM's that tend to be harsh. The lows were ""accurate"" in a sense, but they were always very subtle and had no punch whatsoever. I listen to broad spectrum of music, from classic rock, acoustic, modern pop music, and every once in awhile bluegrass and classical. For any Rock music (Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, Metallica) these headphones were very anemic. I've owned Yamaha EPH-100 (IEM's) and Audio Technica M-50's (Overear) and both of these made Rock music sparkle. The SE315's were the opposite, guitars sounded weak in the mix and bass drums had 0 thump. This was especially apparent when listening to AC/DC where the overdriven guitars should be bright and punchy in the mix. With these headphones they sat in the back and while Brian Johnson's vocals screamed in your ear. This can be fixed with scooped EQ'ing, but the headphones lose the natural quality I was looking for. The soundstage of these headphones is also just average. The SE315s don't squash any of the of the instruments, but they don't separate them either. When listening to acoustic music like James Taylor and Alison Krauss they sounded decent, but lacked that presence of ""being in the room"" feel. To summarize, if you don't like punchy bass and want very natural sounding headphones these are probably for you. If you like headphones that brighten the sound of music stay away from these, you'll feel like you're overpaying.

Fit and Design: The design of these headphones are stellar. The headphones are lightweight in your ear, but have a very sturdy build. They both look and feel like they are meant to last and can take everyday abuse. Shure offers you a wide selection of tips, so you should be able to find a tip that offers a great seal in your ear without having to make a separate purchase.Initially I couldn't find a tip for my ear's, but I eventually cut the end tip off the Triple flange earpiece and I was able to achieve a comfortable and consistent seal. The over the ear design is both comfortable and secure, however if wear glasses you may find yourself adjusting your frames ever so often."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,This item is terrible. The right earbud didnt even work and sound quality was awful. Highly not recommended
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are are JOKE! Waste of money . . . DON""T be fooled by the price! These sound no better than my 10 year old Sure 210's and the fact is Shure isn't the only game in town anymore. I have several ear buds I'm trying out, Focal Sphear S are the most accurate and present a balanced sonic signature - and for $109 a bargain. For bass lovers, Klipsch R6 ll are your buds. Comfortable and a super bargain at $59.00. These are not as accurate sonically as the Focals, but these (Klipsch) are heavy on the bass and lots of folks are looking for that. They sound good, but not as good as the Focal's, IMO. I was looking for one pair of ear buds, but ebded up keeping both the Focal's for everything but motorcycling and the Klipsch for under helmet use when sonic aren't as important and the bass wash out from the wind buffeting will be compensated for with the extra bass from the Klipsch.

As for these Shure's - they are very hard to insert into your ear and the stiffing of the wire for the first 3 inches or so coming out of the buds is very awkward. The biggest atrocity is the lame sound. Very bland, terrible bass and low definition -- very disappointing! RETURNING. :("

8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about 2 years now. I'd like to give it a 4.5 stars. Never once had an issue. I used to work in a manufacturing plant as a tech and these have been through many different conditions. I used them nearly almost everyday and even for runs. Listening to music was still enjoyable during lunches while the plant ran, these block out a good bit of noise. Sound quality is great, more on the warm side that allows you to enjoy music for many hours. Soundstage is pretty good as well, especially for a single driver. Bass is present but not real punchy but can be deep. I paid 120 (like new) when I got mine a couple of years ago and it has been a great investment. The replaceable cable is a huge advantage sense I gone through a few pricey headphones before that went bad due to the jack or ripping the cable. These are a very good starting point for an audiophile. The only real gripe I have that has always bothers me is I wish Shure gave an option for shorter cables. They don't feel cheap but are still pretty light. For best sound use the foam tips from Shure or Westone. Oyaide makes a nice cables that brings the highs out more in the headphones but the headphones out the box are great."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before you go off looking at all these reviews, you need to understand one thing:

1) IF YOU DON'T USE THEM PROPERLY:

a) the noise cancellation isn't going to work well
b) You aren't going to hear the true bass or quality if you don't know the proper way to put these in your ears, and make sure the ear buds are deep in your ear and have made a SEAL

90% of the any negative comments are usually about sound quality, bass, the headphones not staying on the ears, etc. And 90% of that is due to people not taking the time or effort to understand how to use these right. You have to put them on correctly. And yes, the added plastic that is bendable at the end of the earbuds work GREAT.....if you wrap them around your ear properly and bend it enough so that they do not come off your ear. You have to really bend that plastic around, even down to the very low end of the ear in back. When you do, these suckers will stay on if you're doing somersaults...so the claims that these earbuds don't stay on your ears is nonsense.

Ok yea the bass. It's not like it's gonna be so loud that it's going to blast your ears but the bass is very good IF again you seal the earbuds right. That means again, making sure you use the RIGHT earbuds for YOU. There are several types of sleeves. Experiment and try each of them out. Don't just try the default black spongy sleeves. And with any of the sleeves you gotta put them DEEP in your ear. I found the 3 studded white earbuds work the best at least for me. They get right in there deep in your ear, they don't bruise your ear or make you uncomfortable either, and they really seal your ear so you hear very high quality out of these earphones. You'll know when you have put it on right when you can barely hear a thing, the noise cancellation should be working well before you even turn on the music and you'll know when you've got them in right..trust me. You have to really make sure you aim the earbuds to the middle of your ear canal and then push those suckers in hard! they're not going to damage your ear, just try it for once!

As far as the wires going bad I have not experienced that yet. I know I did have a defective pair that I did have to return to Guitar Center but they replaced them in no time and the new ones are just fine. I even called Shure about it and their customer service seemed fine to me, the guy said absolutely not should they have been tripping out like that. Sure enough, the new ones Shure sent guitar center that I now have are working great. I've owned shure headphones before. So far, I don't see why people are saying the quality or quality is not there. Again there will be defective buds here and there.

And VERY IMPORTANT::: you gotta replace those ear buds. Those seals get weaker and weaker over time. I love the sport ribbed. They keep in, light, comfortable and seal great. The spongy kind suck. I have to replace these every 4-6 mo though or you'll loose the great isolation. I mean that's expected, ear buds don't last forever and it's cheap to get a new pack as well so keep this maintenance in mind.

No I do not work for Shure (I'm sure I will get some trolls here so wanted to put that out there also). I'm a Software engineer who listens to music DAILY at work while I code and so I use these suckers a lot. They've been great as long as again you use them correctly people. Read the d*** manual for once ok? Yea there's not a lot there but it does tell you how to properly wrap them around your ears and it takes a few times to get used to it and get it right. Be patient, don't give a product 1 star just because YOU haven't made an effort to do your due dilligence to check whether maybe it's YOU who aren't doing something right and to try it for a while and find out that all these issues are nonexistent in reality once you get the hang of it."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this almost daily for more than 6 months now. At first, I wasn't so pleased with the subdued bass. After a few days of intensive listening, my ears finally appreciated its sound signature. The thumpy bass I originally sought for was pleasantly replaced with a more refined bass that does not drown out the other frequencies. I have to say that I find more enjoyment in this when listening to rock / alternative music more than anything else. Comparing this to my recently purchased Audio-technica Ath-m50x, I'd have to say that I quickly switched back to SE315 because there is not much advantage, at least for me, in taking with me on the road the bulkier Ath-m50x. I end up listening to music more with this gem than I do on the Ath-m50x (which is also outstanding given its price.) The fit in my ear is near perfection. I can listen to music for hours straight at a time. I handle it almost without care but there are no signs of it breaking any time soon. I highly recommend the SE315 and I am actually looking to get one of the higher end of this lineup soon."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Four years in of normal wear, the right headphone crapped out completely. Thought it was the cable; got a new one. Still no right headphone. For $200, I would expect something built to last."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There are cheaper sound-isolating earphones out there, and I've had more than a few of them. Some of them have been as cheap as $10. For the kind of money the SE315's cost, you could buy about 20 sets of those. Those cheaper options work well enough if all you care about is getting sound into your ears for a few short hours each day.

What sets the SE315k apart is the construction quality, mostly. And, if you like critical listening, you will NOT be disappointed. They sound clear and quite neutral. They're also quite comfortable to wear once you get used to in-ear units (it's quite a different experience from on-, around- or over-the-ear units).

My most recent set of earphones (and favorite, until now) is the Shure E2C, which will be the point of primary comparison. Those earphones were great at the time I purchased them and would still perform great today if it weren't for the degraded insulation on the cable at the point where it loops over the ear. Currently, the E2C's still technically work, but the cracked insulation is irritating the skin behind my ears. The SE315's solve this problem with both a durable, bendable ""lead"" at the earphone end as well as making a quick-disconnect on the earphones so cable replacement is simple, inexpensive, and effective. The durable lead holds its form better than a bare insulated wire so it's less likely to degrade from flexing so the cable should last longer, as well.

The SE315's fit my ears quite a bit better than the E2C's being replaced. The E2C's driver unit stuck out quite a bit from the ear. The SE315 folds the driver unit inward a little bit and sits more flush with the ear. If you're going to rest the side of your head on a pillow (like I do on an airplane), you'll appreciate the difference. The new shape somehow also allows for greater long-term comfort.

The E2C's came with a trio of rubber tips and two sets of foam tips. The SE315, on the other hand, comes with a trio of rubber tips, four sets of foam tips (three of them are a kind of memory-foam that mirrors the shape and size of the rubber tips), and a triple-layer rubber tip (like earplugs). If you can't find a fit from those included options, or if you want a *really* custom fit, you can always have a set of custom tips made for your ears. There's a number of companies that will take a mold of your ear and make the tips that fit the earphones.

The case I got with the E2C's was a hard, circular shell covered in a durable woven nylon fabric. Inside was a hard plastic ring to loop the cable around while the earphones and connector slotted into the middle. The case that comes with the SE315's is a soft-sided oval in the same (or VERY similar) fabric. There's no rigid structure at all. I can see the argument both for and against the hard shell case and the one for the SE315's will work great, just differently.

The only complaints I have with the SE315's (besides the cost which, again, is worth it to me) relate to the ease of use. Pulling the tips for replacement requires quite a bit of effort, even with the suggested twisting action. Also, trying to get them into my ears with that more durable lead at the earphone side is a little tricky - they'll tend to fall out or away before I get them fully seated and the cable routed around the top of my ear. The E2C's don't have either problem. It's just something I'll need to get used to, I guess."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, nice and simple as I have been researching earbuds for the last month. I've bought and returned a set of Beats, corded and wireless, Bose noise cancelling, Jaybirds, most had fitting issues all had serious sound issues. The reason I wanted a new pair is for the gym (weights, cardio machines and spinning, running) to have great sound with decent volume. I also use these for travel at times.

First, the fit; right out of the box they have the medium tips that are a memory foam - Perfect fit and they stay in, even without the cords over the ears, with cords over, even better. For running, many others have fallen out on me, these, with cord over the ears do not! The memory foam locks in nicely just be aware of whats going on around you as they block out most ambient noise. The cords have a bendable wire in the first 3-4 inches from the connector that bends easily to form over your ear, works great and you really don't notice it after a few minutes, no rubbing at all. There are extra tips included and you can order more from Amazon.

Sound; now here's is the hard part, I am not a teckkie or audiophile. I just like good quality sound and know it when I hear it. I want great volume, and everything else to basically even out and the ability to pick out differing instruments and vocals. These do the job wonderfully. I listen to rock, hip-hop, alternative, even some Johnny Cash and these rock them all. It's amazing what you miss in your music with certain earbuds. Also, during my evaluation, I played music ripped from CDs (best quality but barely) most of my music is simple itunes downloads and many ""mastered for itunes"" all sound great with very little noticeable differences. However, on any of the others I purchased there was a huge difference in quality. These Shures make my music sound better, simple as that.

Now, I also tried the 215's, not bad either if you want to stay in the 100.00 range, great choice, just not as much depth on the bass would be my guess, but very clean. The 535s were, well awesome on another level if you want to shell out 450-500, I'm not there yet. These are just for casual use. Had a serious question for Shure before my purchase, ""will my ipod nano drive these buds"" and they responded the next day that any ipod can drive any of their buds series...And they do very well!

Cons: If any, the cord is very long, but I run it under my shirt, and behind my back at the gym and that works. Inline controls would be cool but I understand that they can be ordered separately which is cool but may be a problem as it will probably add serious length to the cord.

Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Price: At this price for these types of headphones, you should only buy if you are an artist, or an audiophile. If you are planning to use these on your iPod as you walk or jog were ever you go, these are not really for you (will discuss below). I would definitely recommend these to any artist for its quality and price, not to my average friend.

Quality: The quality is outstanding. I am still amazed in finding background instruments on songs I listen to every day. I can hear every drum and the different snare sounds in the songs. The bass (instruments) sound amazing. The bass in electronic music is ok, since Shure headphones are known to be more about quality than bass (something that people complain, but remember, these are quality headphones, meant for artist and what not). So far, I am amazed and in love with the quality of these headphones.

Conformability: They are very comfortable, and they don’t fall off (and I mean it, since I tried running with them and they did not even move). They can some effort getting use to them, by their design and over ear placement that they have, but after the first 2-3 days of using them, they are just a habit putting them on and having them for a long time. You can have these headphones at full volume, and you won’t get a buzzing sound from the music being too loud (although I still don’t recommend using them at full volume for a long period of time, it will damage your ears).
Warning: I have to say and remind people, these are quality headphones. If you buy some nice 4x4 tried to go off round, and put them on your Prius , you wont even go over a puddle. Same goes with these headphones, when you put them on your iPod, tablet, or any device that does not have a good audio driver, you wont get the full quality of these headphones. I have used them on my iPod, iPad, and my sisters Samsung phone, and they sound much worse than being plug in to my laptop and speakers. At full volume, the bass makes them sound like they blew up, and the music sounds distorted. If you put the volume at 90% you don’t get that problem, but it is still something to keep in mind. You can literary block all outside sound at around 20% of your volume, but some people like full volume to get the max feeling, and this might be a problem if you don’t have the right player. I don’t use them to walk around and such, but if I would plan to buy these for that reason, I would say get a ponos music player (only mobile player I know with a good sound card, there might be more out there, but I don’t know any).
Also, I mention I used these for running (once) but I don’t recommend using these $200 headphones were they can be damaged by the movement (although not likely, since they were made for people in live concerts, and they move a lot). Also, you cannot hear anything from the outside, and that can be dangerous when crossing streets, etc.
Overall: I am in love with these headphones, and if it weren’t for its price and the problems with low quality audio drivers, I would tell everyone to get them. I really love these, and am happy. Hope this review helps on my experience with these headphones."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the finest earphones I have owned so far, with regard to both audio quality and mechanical design. They are a significant improvement over the older SCL-2 and SCL-3 models, with considerably more bass extension and greater presence in the midrange. Their only weakness is that they do not reproduce extreme highs. They are solid at 10 KHz but do not have useful output at 15 KHz. The trebles is still quite crisp. They do not have quite the openness and detail of my Grado Labs SR-225 headphones. They have to be classified as ""near-audiophile"" but they are not that far off. The more expensive SE-425 or SE-535 may be able to cross that line but I have not had the chance to hear them.

These phones do not have the big, booming bass sound that many people like, especially for rock music. If you want that characteristic, get the Ultimate Ears ""TripleFi"" 10 which have a big peak in the 100-500 Hz range. The TF-10 rocks but the Shure is much better for classical, jazz, folk, etc. It also handles heavy metal just fine if your device has the power to drive it properly.

At this point, I have lost four pairs of earphones to wiring failure, usually about the time the warranty expired. The SE series now have user-replaceable wires which is definitely a good thing. They are attached by a clever swivel connector which further improves their ability to stay in place and probably reduces stress on the wires. It introduces the question of whether the connector will be reliable in the long term but it works fine, without introducing noise, when new. The wires go over the ears and the first couple of inches have a thick sheath which molds to the ears to some extent and should protect the wires from abrasion on metal glasses frames. I lost a pair of SCL-2 phones to this.

They fit very snugly into the ear, more like a hearing aid, which keeps them in place better than any others I have had and also gives outstanding sound isolation. They are a bit tricky to insert and you are more aware of them initially but I find them quite comfortable. You can put your head on a pillow or wear earmuffs without any problems."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this not from Amazon but from duty free at airport mostly for the ""sound isolation"" feature of it. In terms of sound isolation, yea it's pretty good, great even. Your mileage may vary with fitment to the earbuds that came with this, most of which I find comfortable. The earbuds are bulky and not suitable for a long usage, but the biggest offender is the sound quality: it's an absolute mess. I understand that some headphones aspire for more neutral sound but they screw it up here. There is great clarity at the expense of bass, but it should not be a trade off. Other headphones, have achieved clarity without compromise. Bass is nearly non-existent and the effect is jarring and unpleasant. Compared this to my Sound Magic E30 sound quality on this headphones does not even come remotely close. I have bluetooth headphones that sounds better than this. Also cables are too thick heavy, I simply hate it."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE315 are marvelous headphones. It APPEARS Shure has solved ALMOST every issue with their previous headphones.

Pros:
* They're Shure headphones, so they sound great and come with lots of different tips for nearly any preference.
* The in-ear comfort is exactly the same has previous Shure entries. If you've owned Shure before, you know what you are getting into for fit.
* The replaceable cable is something that was SORELY needed. Nothing is worse than paying $200+ on a pair of headphones and having the cord break just out of warranty and it cost nearly the purchase price to have them replaced by Shure. Now just replace a $50 cable which admittedly is expensive, but a lot less than it would have been with previous Shure headphones.
* The body of the headphone itself is angled differently, so they are more flush to your ear. They should work better with earmufs, ear on a pillow, etc.
* The ""over the ear"" part of the cable is now covered in a thin foam-like sheath, so hopefully less cord breakage which has plagued Shure headphones.
* The 1/8"" jack now seems sturdier than previous models and is angled, so it should last longer.

Cons
* Yup, they're Shure so yup, their expensive.
* I loved that on my previous two Shure headphones that the cord split in the MIDDLE, so if the part of the cord connected to the 1/8"" jack needed to be replaced, it was a cheap replacement. Also, if the cord gets jerked away (caught on something) it just disconnected in the middle. This feature is gone. The cord is one single piece like with other headphones.
* The 1/8"" jack itself, while beefy and angled (both great features) is REALLY fat - about 1 cm wide. If you don't use a case (like I do for my iPhone), you'll be fine BUT if you do use a case, I think there is an EXCELLENT chance you won't be able to plug in the headphones unless you ream the case hole wider (which is what did, using a knife), get a case with a huge headphone jack hole, or stop using a case (not an option for me).

Overall, I'd mark the SE315's as about 4.5/5. They are three steps forward (yay replaceable cable) and one step back (HUGE headphone jack and a single piece cable instead of a split cable design). I do intend to get the ""CBL-M+-K"" for the iPhone mic and music controls and maybe that will have a more svelte 1/8"" jack."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always hated earbuds. When it comes to music listening, I generally don't like anything that sticks into my ear canal. Pretty much every set of earbuds I've ever tried ends up hurting my ears and sounding crappy. I prefer headphones that rest on the outer surface of my ears, or cover them completely, like the Bose QC headphones, which have been my favorites for many years.

The downside to not liking earbuds, of course, is that you can't do much physical activity wearing headphones, because they're just too hot and confining; your ears get all sweaty, and you worry about body moisture damaging the pads and/or the components inside the headset. But I've never actually spent much time with PREMIUM earbuds, so, with Father's Day approaching, and after doing a little research, I decided to drop a few hints on the 315's from Shure, and take a chance that ONE of the multiple pad options included with these would work for me.

This particular set of earbuds works with a single, ""high definition"" driver. The higher model numbers use multiple drivers to cover different frequency ranges ... basically like ""two-way"" and ""three-way"" speaker systems. I suppose they're probably impressive, but I can't offer any comparisons here, and frankly, while I was pretty sure I wanted/needed a bit more ""hoo-yah"" than the 215's, I couldn't possibly see myself spending more than $200 on a set of earbuds, so I opted for the 315's.

Plenty of reviewers have talked about all the technical plusses of these earbuds (e.g, detachable, Kevlar-reinforced cables; great frequency response, etc., etc.), so I'll just cut to the chase of how/why I concluded these earbuds are great. Let's just assume the drivers on any products you get from Shure are going to be state of the art (and these are). What's REALLY great, however, is that Shure provides a packet of EIGHT different types/sizes of earpads (S/M/L rounded foam; S/M/L rounded hollow rubber; a silicone ""tree"" type, and a foam cylinder, so your chances of finding ONE set/size that actually fits YOUR ears is excellent). Further, the fit of the earpads is not just a matter of comfort ... properly fitting earpads are CRUCIAL to getting the most out of what these things can do. If the earpads don't properly fit your ear canal, for example, the whole bottom end of your music just disappears.

All the earpads are soft material, solidly attached to a smaller/harder rubber cylindrical core. This core fits neatly over a barbed, hard-plastic tube that sticks out of the ear module itself. All the foam varieties are amazing, in that you can totally smash and moosh them, making them look absolutely awful, and within a few minutes they'll resume their original shape. I took the time (about an hour) doggedly going through pretty much every earpad option in the bag, until I figured out that the large, rounded black foam earpads were the ones that worked best for me. That is, once I put them in, they were actually comfortable; they stayed firmly in place, and I didn't have to jam on them or push them further into my ears to get the full frequency range of the music.

In terms of sound quality, these earbuds will most definitely give the listener WAY more than he/she could ever dream of getting from the ""cheapie"" earbuds that are typically thrown in with personal music devices, but Shure also understood that when it comes to earbuds, all the advanced audio technology in the world isn't worth squat if the darn things don't fit properly in your ear. For me, Shure finally solved that problem. I'll still opt for over-the-ear headphones when I can, but now, I don't ""hate earbuds"" anymore, and I've got a high-quality audio solution for when I'm walking, exercising or riding my bike. Thank you, Shure!"
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"tl;dr: great sound clarity, reliable, great for long term wearing, lacking bass, wonderful shure warranty coverage and overall customer service.

Have had my SE 315 (Clear) for 5+ yrs now and have had 0 problems. No cord rot like I've heard of. I do keep them in their case when I don't use them but i worked in a call center for 6 months and wore these for 7 hours a day and they never got uncomfortable.

Outstanding clarity. I can hear sounds I can't with many other speakers, little details that elevate this product to a different standard. The only downside is they lack a good bass profile. That part blows but it's not a deal breaker.

Noise cancelling is quite good as well."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these earphones!!!

Pros: If you know what you are doing and are patient, these will be the best earphones for the money you have ever purchased. Yes the cable where it attaches to the earbud is stiff, it has a wire in it to form to the curvature of individual ears. The bass is tuned ""Properly"", you will have to do a little eq adjusting to get it to sound how you like it. I use my pair with my S5 and with a little tweaking have hard hitting bass and super clear highs, and rich mids. Patience is key. Study the product you purchased, read the literature, and you will be super happy with these. They are designed by pros and show in the long run. The last pair I had lasted me for 7 years before the cables went out. (back when they didnt detach) Isolation is perfect. cant hear a thing except the music. If you are getting ear fatigue you should switch the size of the insert to something smaller or a different material.

All in all, they sound amazing and the over ear design is perfect. The same way any performer is able to keep a pair of these in their ear for performance after performance should be evidence enough.

AMAZING earphones!!!!"
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So i've had my SE315's for over 4 years now and I could say that they are still great.

You could hear things very clearly, and you can hear things that you would never had heard before.

Also, Shure's customer service is great. I actually obtained by SE315's from a warranty swap since my SE310's cord failed. And I obtained my SE310 from a warranty swap too...since my E3G's tips got stuck in my ears...lol that wasn't fun

They're not that great at bass, but you aren't buying these for bass."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I was looking for a good set of portable, high quality, reliable and well built, in ear monitors. I am an audiophile and a high-end audio electronics engineer and manufacturer. I bought these not as an audiophile but for daily use at home, the gym and when traveling.

I read with interest, the numerous reviews here, before I made the purchase. I have to say that the reviews are spot on and I am VERY pleased with them. The removable wires are great and allow for excellent fit and adjustment. They are also of very good quality and rugged. I expect them to hold up very well.

The caveats are ALSO true, especially about them fitting properly and how much this impacts their performance...especially bass. These are accurate and produce the ACTUAL musical event very well. Many cheaper headphones and especially ear buds or in ear monitors, purposely boost the bass. These do not. My first impression was that they were forward, bright and lacking bass. This changed quickly as I first determined the right fit sleeves for my ears. They also needed to break in for a day or so, upon which time they further improved. I first compared them to a $20 pair of skull Candy ear buds that my son uses and I thought WOW, there is the bass. I listened more and I realized that the cheaper ear buds just had REALLY exaggerated bass and no resolution otherwise. This is very important to keep in mind, as you may be dissatisfied with these at first listen, if you are comparing them to other inexpensive ear buds, but DON'T give up on them. Find the right fit, let them break in and then decide. They still may not be your cup of tea, but my conclusion now, after using them for less than a week, is that I am VERY satisfied and I initially considered returning them.

I looked at the 200 series as well as the 400 and 500 series products. I decided that for $200, the 300 series should give me what I am looking for without spending too much and yet not leave me dissatisfied. I am very satisfied with the performance for the investment. If anything, I am curious how much better the 500 series would be. It appears that they DO go deeper, with two additional bass drivers. I would certainly consider them in the future and possibly if I decide that I want a pair of 'monitors' for more serious listening at work, where I would be doing extremely critical listening.

I also have a pair of Grado SR325 headphones and they are great. I have also recently auditioned the Audeze LCD-X headphones. The Audeze headphones are exceptional! They are also very different than in ear monitors and cost $1600. I wanted a good pair of in ear monitors for their portability and convenience. I mention this only as another point of reference. In ear monitors are different than headphones and really cannot be directly compared.

I used them for several hours at the gym today, both running and lifting weights. They stayed in, even while I sweat, and the noise isolation was very good!

Regarding their noise isolation properties....exceptional! In fact, they do such a great job that I have to either mute my music or take them off if I need to interact with family or exist outside of my musical isolation....not a bad thing!

I don't typically write product reviews, but I have been SO impressed with these, and I also didn't want people to almost make the same mistake as myself and dismiss them without a proper fit.

If your goal is to enjoy music with great resolution, exceptional noise isolation, comfort and great build quality for everyday use, I cannot recommend them highly enough!"
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a long time customer of Shure because they produce the highest quality sound products at a semi-reasonable cost. The SE315-K headphones have lived up to my high expectations, and then some. As a previous employee at a company that used to be run by a guy named Steve, I've had the opportunity to meet with several headphone manufacturers and sample their products, including Beats (the worst), Bose (great but pricey), and Shure. Since then I've promoted Shure's product and will continue to do so. Don't believe the advertising from Beats, they are all brand name and no substance."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Amazing Amazing before I say anything else oh yeah did I mention Amazing! ! OK now to my review my journey began 2 days ago while I was at the gym I had my reliable brainwavz s1 a beautiful and amazing sounding iem's but just like other earbuds the came to an end by a machine at the gym you know the usual wire caught and pulled earbuds dead so I was bummed I don't train with anyone else except my music it's my constant amp up so of course I couldn't go one day without them I had a pair of chepo earbuds but if your like me once your use to that amazing sound there's no going back so I started showing instantly that night and since I literally needed them the next day I took to best buy as my refuge of course they had the beats and bose two brands that I really didn't want beats just being such a mainstream sell out product that really is over priced and bose sorry but I like a variety of earbud tips not just some that look like a fine from a fish there seriously ugly iem's so I looked up the other two that still were contenders sony and klipsch I knew right away I didn't want the klipsch even being the new R6 I was already a member of that class with my old brainwavz s1 it was definitely time to move up and so I took to sony grabbing the xba-h1 witch claimed to have dual drivers and blah blah I really expected something worthy what I got was complet trash!!!! So I returned the by the way they weren't defected they were just horrible seriously for 170 bucks my chepo 10 dollar ones were better so now what was I to do it really sadness me that I was so close to buying some beats tour 2.0 but then I remembered that guitar center sold shure so I went right away I had a choice between the 4 the 2 and 315 and went with 3 s so I get home and what do you know the right driver is blown out after all this I got a defected one so back they went that same day now getting to the point I tried them on only to be again disappointed they had great I mean amazing midst and highs but lacked bass and I couldn't find any tip at this point to fit secure I like my iem's to go all up in my ear canal lol not just sit there on my ear like most do so messing with all the tips I finally found that the tri flange did the job to a perfect degree now the only thing still that was probably the most important part was the bass my brainwavz s1 had amazing bass and these almost 3x the price were lacking behind them just as I thought I can't believe shure rips people off like this I remembered someone saying try messing with the equalizer by the way I use it with my Galaxy S4 so I went in and added bass and ohhh myyyy gooddd I was so happy I did not only did they kill my brainwavz s1 in bass but in everything else literally leagues apart but in all honesty I would still buy some brainwavz s1 there amazing for there price and that's my story take your time with these ear buds there professional caliber iem's they must be treated as such take your time finding the right tips and to any one complain that these baby's don't have bass wait till you guys mess with the equalizer the bass the vocals the mids the highs pure music nirvana
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely decent headphone, most part of the music is great, but human vocal part feels low or far away.
Had an E3C before, love it, but it was kind of fragile, and ended up broken it. Found that no longer in production, so went to get this (supposedly) shure's replacement for E3C.
No, not as good.
Here's how it feel v.s. the old E3C:
Pro:
1. Stronger, haven't achieved to break it yet (about 4-5 years), both the wire and the headphone are working flawlessly.
2. I like the stiff wire on top, make it easier to hold the shape on my ears.

Con:
1. the size is kind of large, it took me (my ear) at least a year to get comfortable with it. Before that, the big earbud rubs an area in my ear, and it gets hurtful after a few hours.
2. The vocal part of the music just feels far away than normal. The acoustic and instrumental part of the music is pretty decent and sometimes amazing. But when human voice starts, it sounds lower than it was/should be.

Personally I've just upgraded to an se535, I know it's strong, I won't lost it accidentally, and I may be using it most of the day while working, it make some sense to me.
On the other hand, if you too think se535's price tag is pretty mad, try a few others first. I do think there are better ones out there for this one's price. Or, if you listen elusively to non-vocal music, it's probably a good choice."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't decide between the 315's and the 425's, mainly because I wasn't sure the 425s could actually be worth $100 more. The only differences between the two models are 1-sound quality, 2-adaptor and 3-carrying case. The case thing is easy, because who cares what case it is? The 425s have a hard case, the 315s have a soft case. The soft case is actually a little cooler, but the hard case is probably more useful in protecting the buds. I'm not one to use a case unless I'm traveling or such anyway. The 425s come with the adapter for standard headphone jacks. If you really need one you likely already have it, and since they only cost a couple of bucks to buy, I don't think that should count in the comparison. So that leaves us with sound quality. Ok, funny story: When I first tried out the 425s my husband came by and asked why I had that awful look on my face. I was so disappointed! They were tinny and made the music sound cold and dead. I took them out, very disappointed, and tried the 315s, which sounded a bit warmer. When I put the 425s back in a few minutes later I realized that if my fingers were on them, they sounded amazing. Well, a bit of fiddling with the different sleeves and I found a set that fit my ear well. These aren't slam-in-your-ear-and-go earbuds. It takes a moment to get them on and adjusted (tho I can see that getting easier with practice) but when you do - WOW. Here is my best tip: Get them in the way you think they are supposed to go, then push on the housing and see if they sound better. If so, you're not getting a good fit and you should try a different sleeve or re-seat them. The foam versions of the sleeves can be rather hard to get on and off, but it is worth it.

So, which ones did I keep? The 425s. Yeah, there really is $100 difference in the sound. Now, everyone is different, and I'm using these as iPod/computer earbuds, not for reference or monitoring, but for me the detail produced by the 425s is excellent.

The 315s are ok, but that's the issue, they're just ok. For the price they should be at least good. They're marginally better than your basic $20 earbuds. They're not $150 bucks better, for sure.

I've been through a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years. I have returned more pairs of earbuds than I care to admit in the $100 range, too. The 425s are better than any earbuds I've ever tried (tho NOT more comfortable, at least not yet). The 425s are actually better than my very expensive Sony over-ear, full size headphones, too.

I like the cord design. I was concerned about the detachable cord, given some of the other reviews here, but I hear no static so maybe they've fixed that issue. I tested that out in both models and couldn't see any difference; neither had any static.

And as for sound-isolation. I don't feel like I'm deaf to the world with them on, but I certainly can't hear a lot of external noise. For example, I'm sitting in a room 10 feet from a TV on which there is a loud football game playing. With the music on I cannot hear the game at all. If I turn the music off, I can hear the TV. It's pretty much the same effect as having a pair of the sort of foam earplugs ya wear to a concert on, so, ya know, set your phone to vibrate.

I'm very satisfied with the 425s Day 1 (this is all not having burned them in yet). The 315s are on their way back."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for nearly a year now, they are by far the best in-earphones i have come across. i am in no ways an audio-phile but i'm quite specific about sound quality and i have to say these sounds great, they are clear but provide a warmth to the music and they pick up on the full recordings allowing for a fuller experience. The isolation is near perfect, at higher volumes you cannot hear any background sound, even at low volume unless overly loud there is no background sound.
The durability had to be one of the biggest selling points for me, i have gone through about $700 worth of other earphones only to have them stop working or fall apart after only months of use, the cord is very durable, from memory its made of Kevlar, it feels strong and is definitely stronger than the cord you find on cheaper sets ( after rough use on my behalf and not having stored in the given case my cord has begun to break but to no fault of the manufacturing), the actual jack itself is very strong and unlikely to break even from the roughest users. The fact that the cord can be changed is a major bonus, although i am not to sure where to purchase one from. The actual earphones may seem fragile but are in fact really quite strong.
In the package you get and case, its good but could have been better, also about 10 different earpiece sets ranging from rubber cones to foam inserts, also includes a cleaner for the earpieces. One con i came across was the yellow foam earpieces you get, i'm not sure if it was just mine but it seems as if a monkey had cut the pieces, one piece was about 3mm thick and cut on an angle and the other was about 1cm think and roughed up without an use at all.
At first the fitting takes time and will be fairly uncomfortable, it took about a week to get used to it.

Overall these are amazing earphones and excellent for the price, they are probably the extent to which you can get away without need of a amplifier and make them great for use with Ipod or other mp3. These will suit any type of music, i listen to mostly hard rock/heavy metal and find these to be amazing for it, i also listen to some r n b etc and although people say these are lacking in bass i find the bass to be ""cleaner"", and you can always change your e.q to get a heavier bass response.
(i use the medium black foam inserts as they are the best isolation for me and i find them easiest to put in, that's another thing, many reviews say they take time to put them on etc, honestly after a while you can put them in just as easily as any earphone)

8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased SE-315's to use live onstage. I'd held out as long as possible using wedges but felt it was time to have my own set of ""ears"" for the various gigs and shows I do. Not wanting to spend a ton of money I looked at several in this price range and these were the standout by far.

Shure's reputation for quality gave me confidence that they wouldn't fall apart after a few months and the fact that the cable and each driver was replaceable was a plus.

I've used them on several shows and find them to be really good and fine for my needs. So much of the fidelity and clarity issue depends on who is doing monitors and what the console situation is that it didn't make sense to be spending $600+ on a set of ears.

All in all I'm happy but the one issue I have is that they may be TOO bottom heavy for my tastes (and I like a lot of bass). It seems in this product market so much emphasis is placed on the low frequency issue that some manufacturers go too far. But I've gotten used to it so it's fine. The other thing is that I was surprised that I was able to overdrive them with my ipod 160gb classic. This happens when I have the volume maxed - which I know is far too high but I just wanted to see what the distortion threshold was. I would have thought there would be a bit more headroom with something this high end.

Overall - I am very happy and don't regret buying them for a second. Now the stage mix is clear and I'm able to control exactly what I want to hear which makes playing a pleasure."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why the hell did Shure change the shape of their headphone from that of the SE310?! I lost my SE310s of three years, and decided to buy the ""replacement"" SE315. The E3C fit nicely inside the ear canal. I could wear it for hours, comfortably, with all noise being blocked out, and a nice tight seal guaranteeing an immersive listening experience. But then Shure changed the shape to what it is now, such that the earbuds just rest inside the opening of the ear canal, allowing much more outside noise to enter.

Soundwise I found the bass to be weaker than that of the SE310--already a mild criticism of both the E3C and the SE315--and the midtones to be weaker and muddier. I've already purchased a set of SE310s on eBay, and will soon be selling these on eBay.

What the hell were you thinking, Shure?! I will never buy a headphone from you again as long as you continue to use this new headphone shape!"
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these predominantly for long mountainbike rides in the French Alps while listening to podcasts and occasionally on long car drives. So I need something rugged, with very high sound quality, and easy to use. They have good sound and appear durable. They block outside sounds effectively but not completely, giving me a safety margin while riding.

Unfortunately, I have to fiddle with them when I try to put them in my ears because of the way they are designed: the wire can rotate completely, so it can get twisted and pop out easily, which is rather frustrating. They are also not labelled left and right, so it was difficult for me to figure out which ear to put them into for a time. These are minor quibbles, given the quality of the sound I get."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these as a warranty replacement for the Shure SCL 3's and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!! The difference between my older ones and the 315's is like night and day. I use these with a Cowon mp3 player (J 3) for bicycle riding, walking and long distance international plane flights and the noise isolation is excellent. The sound quality is like being in the front row of live concert-you can hear every musical note very clearly and the sound separation is super.

When I sent my old Shure's to IL. for repairs, I was hoping they could be fixed and was surprised that Shure sent the 315's instead-PLEASANTLY surprised. The turnaround time was about 6 working days-FL to IL and my compliments to Shure for their excellent customer, something that is lacking with many companies.

These may take a little time to get used to and if you decide to buy them, Shure provides several different earpieces that should fit most people. I used the yellow foam tips with my old SCL's but have changed to the foam tips with these and the sound isolation and quality are greatly improved.

Last, I would not consider myself an audiophile but these headphones are superior to my ears. I have had them for a month with no problems and have been able to hear cymbal, drum and guitar sounds I had not heard with my old SCL's. Hats off to Shure for making a great product and their excellent customer service experience."

3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality and comfort. I see a lot of reviews talking about the lack of bass, most likely that can be caused by bad fit and or the sourse of your music. Make sure to chose the right earbuds from the ones included with these headphones. In my opinion bass is very well balanced and does not overwhelm the rest of the frequencies. These headphones perform so much better when connected to a PC and a proper player with loss less files. You will notice imperfections in the compressed mp3 files. These headphones may be a good way to start getting into high quality music. Sound isolation is great - at 30% volume i cant even hear myself talking, no need for the active noise cancelling. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these! I’m a drummer and everything sounds nice and clear! It sounds so good that they make me want to play all day! They’re comfortable as well! I really recommend them!
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They really aren't that comfortable, but definitely more comfortable than the big Vic Firth sound isolation headphones. Band practice is about 7 hours long, maybe 3 times a week. These only lasted about a month; the left earbud failed. Pretty sad for almost $200. I would've been better off getting two pairs of the cheaper ones so that I'd at least have a pair on hand while the other was sent in for warranty repair."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these yesterday directly from Shure as a replacement for my E3C's that shorted out (which if you read other reviews, were a NIGHTMARE as far as build quality...I went through FOUR pairs of them, each one shorting out after about a year of light to moderate use). Considering the price and the specs, I think this is a welcome (and unexpected) upgrade...so that was a nice surprise when I opened the box (and I will say that Shure makes the return/replacement process pretty painless and their turn around to replace broken headphones is very fast). These (the SE315's) are considerably more cumbersome and robust than the E3C's...but if that means better durability/longevity...I am OK with it. This does, however, make putting them on and getting a good ""seal"" considerably more difficult (actually somewhat of a pain in the butt). This is the main reason for not giving them 5 stars. They have also changed the design so the ear-piece is actually removable now...one assumes so the cables can be replaced without having to replace the earpiece (which contains all the expensive technology/drivers etc)...probably a smart move on Shure's part. I once tried on (but could not afford) a pair of the E5C's...and these seem comparable AS FAR AS BUILD QUALITY (not sound) to those. As far as sound, I will admit that I am not an audiophile or one who espouses to have great knowledge of what ""great sound"" is. I own several pairs of decent headphones, and I can say (having only used them for about 30 minutes last night) these seem to have (for me) very good, balanced, clean sound. My Klipsch Image S4i's (which I recently purchased) have a slightly brighter sound and they seem to bring out the highs better than the Shures...but sometimes that comes across as tinny to me. Perhaps that's because I've used Shure headphones for so long and I am used to a more mid/bass predominating sound. I don't know. But all in all, out of the box, these seems like another quality SOUNDING product from Shure. How they hold up over time remains to be seen."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving these IEMs 2 stars because the sound is awesome and they are the most comfortable IEMs I have ever worn.

Unfortunately, after using them everyday for 3 weeks, the right ear started making a cracking noise, then the volume went down considerably. I would make slight adjustments by pushing them around inside my ear and then they would return to normal sound. They finally went out completely. Luckily I was able to return them for a full refund.

I really really wanted to like these, and I really want another pair, but I am just a little gun shy due to my experience and seeing the same issues reported all over the 'net."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had three pair of Sures, each an updated model, they all go bad in a year or two, always one of the two buds stops working. They say clean them, but that never helps, I believe they use poor components and something inside fails. And I always use their hard case to protect them. Just a very poor design (or good from their perspective--repeat business). The sound really nice when the work, and I find them comfortable. But I suggest getting the Sennheisers--way better reliability and not much difference in sound, and to top it off they're cheaper."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought them hoping to find a temporary replacement for my damaged Grado PS500e. I know that price gap is to big to compare them however i have to say that those Shure SE315 are simply unbelievable wrong. I have also some Monk earbuds (5$) which are performing better in both highs and lows. I have owned a Bayerdynamic 770 which are in the same price range and which are good sounding device.
Those Shure 315 have close-to-decent mids, sibling highs and nonexistent lows. I'm not a bass head since i listen mainly to classical music. Listing to a piano recording makes you cry for every cent they cost. I cannot believe that a company like Shure isn't able to create something better today for the same price. I think they come our with products like this ones just for the market-segmentation mantra. I would not buy the Shure SE315 not even for 3$."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't even think about buying these if you want an earphone that will last more than 2 weeks. I have now had 7 replacement sets all with the exact same issue, the ear buts just fade out and eventually stop working. It got to the point that I have stopped even bothering trying to fix them they are so bad! I literally cannot go 2 weeks before they just die, then it takes 1 month to repair and get back to me!

Comfort wise they are awesome, which makes it doubly frustrating that they are so so poor.

I wrote to share twice, the first time they simply showed no interest despite me explaining the issues, the second time they didn't even reply. My advice, buy something which does not say Shure on it!"
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a fan of HUGE bass or anything, but these headphones need a lot more of it to be good for casual music enjoyment. They would be great for stage monitering as a vocalist. Vocals and other mid to high pitches sound fantastic with great clarity. Also, make sure you save your receipts; Shures do have a problem with on earbud or the other cutting out prematurely. I traded mine in for the cheaper SE215s and couldn't be happier. All the quality and sound clarity with a slightly warmer and well rounded sou."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"these are uncomfortable, loud, poorly balanced, and kinda dirty looking. the solid black may be more aesthetically pleasing. but compared to my ultimate ear 600s, these have a less refined sound. if you're using them as monitors, that may be one thing, but if you are listening to your prime playlist these are not the babies to do it justice.

3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones suck, sound quality is garbage, after a week the bass started buzzing...i want my money back!!!!!

4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"2 stars for the good sound coming out of them but the built quality are the customer service received a -3 Stars.

After a year of usage, one of the two earphone housing split into 2. I also discovered that the cable is falling apart too by the 3.5mm connector jack. The cable also broke off just like the heck of any iphone charger. Anyways, I called customer service, filled out the form, and mailed my split earphones including the cable to Shure for service and didn't hear back from them until a week later.

SURPRISED! The repair cost is $150 for the cable and the earphone housings. NO WAY, SHURE! I told them that I rather sell them as parts on E/bay and get some money + the $150 I can upgrade to another earphones. BTW, I did purchase an audio Technica IM02 for $200 from AMS with a 2 year warranty, and it sounds as good as Shure se530 if not better.

2 weeks later, I received the earphones back from Shure broken as they were. I figure it's just the housing that split into 2. I do have some very good super glue. Why not glue them back together. That I did! It cost me a nothing! For the cable, I purchase a 46"" shure cable from Amazon and couldn't be happier ($38). The length of 46"" is just perfect pocket length. 64"" original length of SE315 cable is just way too darn long for it to be useful!

btw, Amazon currently sells IM02 for $169.95 ATM (1 year warranty). Same price at AMS for a 2 year warranty. Which is a steal!

In the future, I wouldn't not buy another shure product!"
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been a fan of running with headphones for two reasons: They always fall out of my ears, and running on the streets without full use of hearing seems dangerous. I am always on the look out for headphones that will stay in my ears while running for use on the treadmill or on trails.

I came across this article recommending the Shure SE215 for great sound quality and security in ear. I have always used cheap earphones that you can buy at the gym or Target so I was not familiar with the more high end products like Shure, Etymotic and Klipsch. My friend Lauren owns an audio supply company and gave me some Shure SE215 earphones to try out.

Immediately out of the box you can see and appreciate the quality of these earphones. They have 3 basic parts. 1. Ear foam acts like an earplug and blocks out almost all noise. 2. The driver produces the sound
3. The cord that attaches the driver to your music of choice.

After a 5 mile run the earphones are solidly in place. I never had to adjust them at all. I have found that the key to success with these ear phones is the fit of the earplug part. They come with 6 different sizes to fit any ear canal, so fitting should not be a problem for most people.

3 sizes foam and 3 sizes rubber and 1 tool for cleaning out the driver canal.

The noise isolation is really great with these earphones as well. I have used a pair of Beats Studio headphones and these earphones block an equal amount of ambient noise for 1/3 the price. The SE215 would be great to use on an airplane or anywhere you don't want people to bother you.

With the good sound isolation comes one drawback. They act like earplugs, so you can hear everything in your head. It is impossible to use these earphones while eating, the sound of your own chewing is immense. While running there is also a constant boom boom boom with every footfall, this may be distracting for some, it was easy for me to ignore.

Overall these are some really great earphones and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great sound and good sound isolation. Buy them here:[...]

7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before owning my Shure SE215, I always just bought the cheep $15-$30 earphones. By far the best earphones that I have ever had inside my ears. Can't believe that Shure make even better ones then these.
After waiting for my Shure SE215 to come in the mail they finally arrived to my door step. After opening the box and trying them on I knew that these were the Earphone that I have been searching for, for a while now. But before being totally sold, I needed to put them through the toughest test of all. Only one thing came to mind was the local indoor skydiving wind tunnel. For those who aren't familiar with an indoor skydiving wind tunnel, it is a place where skydiver practice their skills in vertical tube with high wind speeds, any wheres from 110-160 MPH. With those type of wind speeds you can imagine that it is very loud inside that environment. The Shure SE215 had no problem with keeping up with the wind noise. Not only was I able to hear my music very clear, I was able to hear the bass clear as day. They also shield my ear from the damaging wind noise. The only thing that I would change if I was the head designer of these kick butt earphones, is that I wish that the earphones could be inserted deeper without causing a very slight discomfort to the ear cannel. But that just might be my ears. After my awesome wind tunnel session I sat around my house just listening to my favorite songs. On most of the songs I heard a lot of things that I never had heard before. The sound is just so clear. It reminds me of watching TV on an HDTV for the first time. How can such a little thing make my head rattle like I was pressing my ear next to a speaker at a concert? You will not regret this buy. Maybe if you lose them or someone steals them. I'm so happy with them so far that I know that if I ever have to buy new earphone, 1-I'm making sure that they are Shures, 2-I'm forking up the money for the SE425s. I hope that this info is more then helpful.
What are you doing still reading this??? Buy them already!!!!!!!"
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! What a waste. I really was looking forward to these. I even took off early from work to be here when the package arrived. Man oh man, I was more disappointed than the night I finally had a date with ______ (Fill in the Blank). Flat, tinny, uncomfortable, bulky, and just down right awful. And I don't mean my date.

I have used a pair of E2c's for years. Had to repair the cable several times but they keep on working. The 315's I thought, would be a nice small step up. Boy was I wrong. I tried every ear tip and none of them provided a solid seal, like my E2's. The only ones that were close, were just OK. I even had one tip pull off the end, and was lodged in my ear canal. I took a lot of jabs for that one. But after the jabs, the guys pulled the ear tip out and I went to the next set.

The cable, although sturdy at the ear, provides too much bulk and is a true pain. The shell pressed my outer ear so hard, it began to just hurt. SO out they came and back to the store they go.

Guess I will just baby my E2's a bit longer as my search continues for a decent pair of earbuds."

2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEM sounds good, but at their price you can easily find much better products, with a better sound (more detailed and immersive, more instrument separation) and most of all which are not made with the feet. The build quality of these IEM is just... I would say ""haha"". I had to send them back a first time because the cable was broken. A second time because of a strange sound (sutured etc) and a speaker playing at 50% of the power it should deliver.
So in terms of sound and quality these Shure are just a scam. And Shure after sales service is so slow. 3 weeks to change a simple detachable/removable cable."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would I buy this product if I had to do it over again? The answer is no.

I was using someone else's SE215's prior, and honestly there isn't a huge difference in quality from my experience. I probably would have been happy spending $100 less, but none the less, these sound pretty good. The cord is also not the twisted thick type that the 215 had and seems to be a standard quality and not all that thick. Depending on what you want, these have a slight bit more low end compared to the 215s."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a professional musician or an audiophile, but these are great headphones. I use these headphones for playing guitar and for my daily commute too and from school in the city via the train. For reference, my previous pair of headphones/ monitors were the Image S4s which I loved so much I bought two of. So far I've owned my image 315s for 3 months. When I first got them I didn't notice that much of a difference to the audio quality of my music other than the headphones producing more mid range sound and less bass. I listen to primarily metal and rock (though I do listen to a little I everything else: rap, country, classical, ect). For that music application the lack of bass did not bother me. Where these monitors really shined was when I plugged them into my amp for my guitar. Again I am not a professional musician. Not even close at that but I'm not deaf. The image s4s were great for my music on my Zune HD (which I only use 320+ encoded audio files) as was the Shures, but as soon as I plugged them in my amp the audio quality on the s4s took a dive. They sound washed overly distorted no mater how I set my amp, so I generally settled for my full sized over the ear set sennhisers (sp). This is where the Shures shined. The audio was perfect. After that I threw my over the ears into my drawer and never looked at them again. After this experience my monitors suddenly had new life. Started to notice just how crisp and responsive the audio really was (I might have been stuck on the lack of bass which ""degraded"" the quality between the s4s and Shures). As for why I love these monitors most (besides look, the clear monitors and braided cable and so cool) they block out the annoying drone of the subway amazingly well. Almost too well. It blocks sound out so much so, I had to buy a set of regular Sony ear buds so I could wear on campus do I could hear my friends when they call out to me (even when I have the volume on the Shures at 2 on my Zune and one monitor in, I still can't hear anyone). The one problem I have is that the sponge ear piece that came with the set got ruined my oil I had on my hand while working on my car and the other sponge sizes don't fit me. Now I have the silicone fittings on which aren't as comfortable. That's all :)"
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Shure E4C which were in my opinion were some of the best. The 315's were supposed to be the newest equivalent since the E4C's have been discontinued. When I first listened to the 315's I thought something was wrong with my computer settings because they were not nearly as crisp and clean as the E4C's. After trying several different sources I came to the conclusion that there was just something different and missing from the SE315's as compared to the E4C's as I had remembered. There is nothing about the 315's I can really say WOW about. Just an average set of earphones.
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was recommended to me by my friend who is a sound engineer. I loved the ""fullness"" of the sound as well as the secure fit and sound isolation qualities. It seemed as if I was listening to twice as much music from the same song. I use them for exercise but I treat them gently. After about 9 mo. of daily use (2hs.) the left earpiece quit working...I could hear the music very, very faintly with the volume turned all the way up. So I bought a new set (I loved the sound). In 6 mo. (no exaggeration) the left earpiece quit working... same thing. To me these earphones are expensive but worth it if they would last for ... say.... 2 years? I am disappointed and will find a better product elsewhere."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb for using under a full-face motorcycle helmet! I love listening to music while I ride. These things are outstanding for blocking out wind noise and maintaining sound quality. I have tried many different models but none seemed to fit under my helmet. I had used a set of Bose in-ears for about 5 years because they did fit under my helmet but the sound was always washed out by the wind noise and my Vance & Hines pipes. The Shure earphones are great for riding. The sound quality is GOOD but there is room for improvement. The sound-isolating feature of these, using the ear attachment pictured, is superb. I also have a pair of over-the-ear JVC HANC250 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I often listen to music while vacuuming and the Shures outperform the JVCs in blocking the noise of the vacuum. Build quality is excellent (running out of superlatives here). The cables are very thick and will no doubt out last the Bose in-ear which eventually started fraying where the cable met the 3.5 in plug. They are a bit awkward to wear at first, but I quickly figured it out. They were very comfortable, even after two hours under the helmet; whereas the Bose would be uncomfortable after one hour. Overall, I am very impressed."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear phones are nothing short of fantastic! At first, I heard a lot of static and artifacts, but then, when I used them on a better audio device, they were amazing. So, the downside is that any interference (such as with an android phone) is picked up and can be heard. when I run it off my macbook pro, it's gorgeous. so, if you're going to use these with a sub par audio player, then it's a waste of money.

Takes a little getting used to the way these fit, but after about 10 minutes, you'll forget they are even there, and the seal they create is awesome, I can't even hear people standing next to me talking. I have my device set to almost the lowest volume level and I can hear everything perfectly, though, I agree that the bass doesn't kick in unless you turn it up a bit, though I still think that's the player's fault and not the ear phones."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SE-315's. (the first pair were stolen) I LOVE these headphones. I listen to everything from country to rap. The sound stage is amazing, you can literally close your eyes while listening to music and visualize where the sound is coming from. I have compared these to the Bose IE2 in ears. They are not even in the same ball park, on sound quaility, the Sure's cable is also thicker, and almost 12"" longer and detachable. Now to the comfort. With multiple choices for the in ear tip these headphones make a great seal and are extremely comfortable and dont come out unless you want them to. From high notes to low notes and everything in between the SE series (215,315,425, and 535) are simply amazing. I HIGHLY suggest these in ears to anyone that doesnt mind spending money on a quaility product! They are well worth it!"

The good: better durability - mentioned in other posts

The bad: I immediately noticed a lack of clarity in the SE315 sound in comparison to their last year's product. Had to return these and purchase the SE535. They also don't fit the same and are bulkier so I had to use the white ear-tips, instead of the black ones, to get a deep fit... and the white ones don't seem to isolate sounds as much."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had many clam-shell only headphone users be surprised by the quality of these headphones. A really good seal is needed in your ear to get decent bass response (other reviews complain about lack of fidelity in that frequency range). I purchased additional flang tips on amazon to get the best fit in my ears. To reduce cord noise when wearing the headphones use a clip to fasten the cord to your clothes and create a tension point to stop the transfer of cord vibration to your ears. I purchased Fii0 replacement cord on amazon to use with a DAC/AMP and get slightly better bass response due to that cords construction (however it is shorter than the OEM cord). Excellent value for the price.
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is one part the product itself but equally about the company that builds and stands behind their product.

I've used Shure products for decades; initially knowing them for their phono cartridges, back in the day on campus radio. They were the cartridge and stylus of choice and I recently replaced the cartridge on my turntable with a great Shure product. In later years I started using their in-ear monitors, slowly going up the product line, buying better and better iterations.

I use my earphones *a lot* - when I fly, these babies are jammed into my ears for the entire flight to block out the babbling cacophony around me. Even if I'm not playing any music, they dull the sound to a reasonable level. Add some music from an iPod or a movie from my laptop or tablet and it's all over; I don't hear a thing except what I'm listening to. I literally have to pull one from my ear to hear what a flight attendant might be saying.

Data centres: when I have to spend time getting hands-on with some equipment, there's nothing better to drown out the thousands of fans and 15K drives that would, otherwise, push me over the edge.

At the race track: suppressing the scream of cars and bikes, there's nothing better. Plus, if I'm on the track myself and need to get some lap time updates from my lap timer, these fit comfortably under my helmet giving me very clear communication.

But through all this, you can tell these things get around and get beaten up a little. What I've found is that the connector cable (or whip) eventually frays and starts crackling intermittently. Ironically, or maybe luckily, this always seems to happen right around 20-21 months into owning the particular iteration I've been using.

Shure have a no-question Warranty policy and have always replaced any faulty parts, free of charge and very fast; 3 times in succession so far.

So really, I get at least 4 good solid years of use out of my headphones. I think that's a pretty fair lifetime for a heavily used piece of consumer electronics.

For a little company from Niles, Illinois, these guys are showing the rest of the world what it is to be a top-tier, customer-obsessed company and they have my loyalty for life!

Go Shure! You guys rock!!"
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a series of Shure earbuds and loved them. I even got used ot the over the ear part. I especially liked the fact that the headphones and cord could be separated to replace the cord when it inevitably burned out first. My old favorites no longer a current product, I bought the SE315-CL. I did not see anything online that said that it had a unified cord, so I was really disappointed when I opened the box. But the box was open. These do not have a ""R"" on one piece and an ""L"" on the other either, and I have had a hard time putting on the first ear correctly. No biggee I guess. I was starting to get used to the harder plastifc/kevlar part near the ear bud, which is much ess comfortable than earlier models.. But I would put up with that too as the sound is good and I find the over the ear fit a good one with my ears. But now less than a month from receipt the right ear has a short or something, and works only intermittently when I pull it or put pressure on it. When I return from this trip I will send it back in and see if at least Shure will stand by the product for a month. Stay tuned."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these headphones heavily for 1 year and 11 months. Finally one of the buds snapped off at the retaining washer. The other side was getting a bit tweaky too and sometimes I would have to adjust it to get sound out. I travel with these to the tune of about 100,000 miles a year. I fall asleep with these on airplanes and often in hotel beds when I can't fall asleep. I run with them, lift weights with them, etc etc. They are USED and used hard.

Seven days ago to the day I filled out the RMA / Warranty form and sent the headphones back. Seven days later (today / five business days) I was surprised to see a box from Shure via UPS on my doorstep.

They replaced the entire thing. Cord, both ear buds, everything. Brand new replacement.. THAT my friends is quality service. I honestly figured I would ship and forget and sometime a month or two down the road I might have a repaired unit. I never expected a new set. I never expected anything to happen in 5 business days.

Awesome! I've used Shure for about a decade and they have lifetime loyalty out of me now. As if they didn't before.."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal and excellent quality. This was by far the best deal that I found and shipping was very fast.
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a very good pair of ear buds as I've been using cheap ones for a while now. My replacement needed to stay in my ear, deliver great sound, be of quality construction, and reduce outside noise. The 315's accomplished all these and I didn't mind spending a little more for them. I've seen other replies stating that they had issues with quality, hoping that doesn't happen to me given the expense of these. So far, so good. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't mind shelling out a up to $200 for a set of good ear buds."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds I have ever owned. My first time with a dual driver earbud and it makes all the difference. Isolates the sound very well and quite comfortable to wear for extended time. Only complaint is simply a payoff to excellent isolation of sound, I cannot hear anything else but the sounds from the earbuds, external voices cannot be heard."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Shure earphones and their older generation and high end new generation are well-balanced, comfortable and offer great sonic clarity. These new generation 315's, were not cheap but the sound was shrill, loud but strident. They were really a disappointment. They also didn't fit or stay in place as well as the previous generation Shure's. I like the change to the cord and the way it attaches to the earpiece. I would recommend looking elsewhere at this price point. Otherwise go for the higher end 535's."

9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"burn it in for a week and the bass will be surprisingly richer.
headphones like this need time to get worked in and the bass will develop very clearly.

also, use the white in ear canal tips, they do the best full seal.
I can barely hear the train coming when I have it in. and I really don't hear it when I have music playing.
It's a bit shocking to just feel the train passing by rather than to hear it.

the sound is clear, I can note compression from non flac and anything below 320kbs audio.

my little sansa clip and the tiny apple's nano can drive these headphones without having to turn the volume up at all."
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used other in ear monitoring buds that had a slightly higher sound quality especially in the bass response. That being said, these produce outstanding quality for the cost. You can get a little more if you're willing to pay quite a bit more."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earphones I ever had, I own a e2g, a e3c, a se115 and now this little beauty. From the e2g to the se115 big difference, the new black foam tips are outa this world for comfort and isolation but the size is bout the same. Now, for the SE315, the sound is amazing, better bass, rich middles and crystal highs. No distortion at all, the new SE detachable cables are a BIG plus, really strong and long lasting feel(my 4y old e2g has some crackings on the wire loop 2cm from the buds but the sound is still perfect. This new cables seem to leave no room for these kind of problem and if they do wear out, you may change the cables only). It is smaller than the SE115 and its differently shaped, it gets inside your ear and bonds with it, there are no tips or nothing coming out of the normal ""ear line"", much more comfy to sleep with them as they seem to dissapear. Well, personally, Im in love with them."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After waiting over a week for the Shure SE315-K, Sound Isolating Earphone's to arrive i got the package and went to try them out. the sleeve that the earphones come with on them already did not work so following the directions of the manufacturer of twisting and pulling on the sleeve the earphone nozzle broke off. now i only have one earphone that is usable and completely defeats the purpose of buying these. this is poor manufacturing and the fact that these broke less than 5 minutes out of the box is very disappointing.

update
Shure (the manufacturer) was very helpful and replaced the broken part for no charge. I am now very happy with the earphones and am very glad that I made the purchase"
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The short story: these earbuds are oddly shaped, but are very comfortable, and provide excellent isolation. I am not an audiophile, so I hesitate to comment on the audio quality, although to my untrained ear they seem to provide excellent sound.

The 315s take a bit of getting used to: figuring out the best way to get them in your ear is a bit tricky (they're the 'over-the-ear' type) but once you get the hang of it they're easy to work with.

The 315s have several advantages over the other two sets of earbuds I have owned. Both of those buds were Shures, one in the $100 range, the other in the $300 range, but they didn't stand the test of time. The more expensive set eventually separated at the cord/earphone junction. The 315s have improved on those designs in four respects:

1. Replaceable cord

2. The end of the cord that attaches to the earphone (basically the section that rides on the top of the ear) is built stronger than the rest of the cord, and the joint between the heavier cord and the lighter cord is covered by a long piece of heat shrink (or similar material) to provide further strain relief. I work in electronics and have used the same technique to bolster cable connections that are subject to frequent movement. It's simple but very effective.

3. The earphone actually rotates on the connection to the replaceable cord, which actually removes strain on the cord/earphone joint. The old style earbuds suffered at least some strain from frequent lateral motion, especially during insertion and removal.

4. Heavier earphone body. That might sound like a disadvantage, but in my opinion it's a plus. The earphone lays perfectly in my ear, and due to it's size, I can easily use the body of the earphone to remove it from my ear. The older designs tempted one to use the cord to leverage the earphones out of the ear, further stressing the relatively delicate cord-to earphone joint. There's no reason to use the cord to help remove the 315 earphone.

That last point also brings up another issue: some have complained of the 315 earphone being prone to separate from the cable, implying that the connection between the two is week. I've not had that problem, but I suspect that folks that have had it have not been removing the earbuds properly: in other words, they have been tugging on the cord to remove the earbud from the ear and, of course, stressing the cord-to earbud connection and making it pop free. A drawing in the manual shows precisely how to remove the earbuds (just as I have described in #4 above). Basically, with the 315s, folks have to unlearn some of their old bad habits with respect to earbuds: use the elongated body of the earbud to remove it from the ear, rather than twisting with the cord."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"best products on the market - period. I've been using Shure now for about 10 years. The sound quality is insanely good, clear, and with lots of deep, deep bass. The proper size foam is imperative for great bass sound. Try different foam sizes, including larger ones than you might initially think your ears need. you wont be disappointed."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by addressing the frequent claims that these headphones lack bass-- they have plenty of bass. I'm the kind of person that loves bass, too, and these buds satisfy my ravenous thirst for bass. Kick drums hit hard and metal sounds as brutal as intended. Maybe they don't create over-the-top boomy bass that muddies music--no--what these little guys produce is far more refined and detailed but they don't lack any power.The mids and the treble are riddled with nuance and subtlety. There's a tragic irony, however, with owning premium headphones like these: Compressed music will start to sound compressed... especially when compressed to less than 320kbps. These are actually replacing my 3-year old SE215s. The old ones still work fine which is a testament to their outstanding build-quality.

If you want it so loud it hurts these headphones will gladly oblige.

I use these with an HTC One with Beats audio (beats enhancement turned off) and the Poweramp music player with custom EQ adjustment."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good headset. Although it fits nicely in ear, however, the sound quality is not good at all. I have Bose QC20i and I absolutely love it. If I compare this Shure headsets with Bose QC20i, I would not even rate one star for Shure. It lacks all the good quality of music and sounds very dull and one of those cheap headsets. Not recommended, if you want these for your music."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,great pair of isolating headphones. you need to choose the right cup among a great choice that comes included. live music standard for sure.
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,These are not that comfortable in your ear and the cord smells like petroleum. I have another pair of Shures and they are better. Sound is very good on both.
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds are the best sounding that I've found. They truly represent the entire frequency range in a way other earbuds just aren't able to do. It's a pleasure wearing them will hiking or walking as they assorted ear tips allow you to find the perfect fit & as a result I can wear them for hours with no discomfort. I can also wear them for hours without any listening fatigue as you don't have to have the volume loud at all to hear everything cleanly.
0,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. I use them at church and in a band. They are comfortable and reduce a ton of external stage noise.
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The se315 earbuds are absolutely amazing and completely satisfying. The sound from these earbuds is rich and full. They provide very nice isolation from exterior sound and the bass will satisfy anyone's musical palate I have fallen in love again with my entire catalog of mp3s. Thank you Shure for such wonderful technology!
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"had 100 dollar ear buds before, and felt cheated. I was reluctant to spend double the amount. I went with these shure in ear monitors, and i simply love them. the noise cancellation is great, they sound awesome, and the fit is comfortable, and do not hurt your ears with long use. I've been missing a lot with my music. the frequency and range is nice and full. You can hear things you have never heard before in your music. These things have me wondering about the SE846's now, just can't swallow that price, maybe some day."
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a replacement pair that were loaned to a friend who lost them. I like them so much I replaced them with the exact ones. Well I might have gotten the next model up if I could have afforded it, but these work great."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th pair of Shure isolation headphones. I got these to replace a pair of Shure SCL3 headphones. I definitely felt that the SE315-K's were an upgrade. With multiple drivers, I felt these had a much better bass reponse and better frequency range. I did feel the fit was a bit more difficult to get right with these than my older pair. However, once the cable got ""broken in"" (it was very stiff to start with which will probably be a good thing for longevity) they have settled in nicely and I get good isolation. Don't give up when you first put them in your ears (it's tough to keep a good isolation initially). Once you get the cable to soften up a bit, they work great."
5,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,super gift
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third pair of Shure noise-canceling earbuds I have owned. For me, the high quality has always been worth the money. I put these in, can't hear a single thing except for the music, and the quality is high enough that I hear parts of the music I never knew existed (for songs I've listened to hundreds of time before).

Advantages:

- Amazing music quality
- Great warranty

Disadvantages:

- Previous Shure versions I've owned have had the ""cushion"" portion of the earbuds deteriorate over time. Thankfully the give you a bunch of replacements.
- The SE315-K version doesn't easily wrap around the back of my ears like the older versions did. A little annoying but manageable."
7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure earphones are simply the best sounding! Full range, extremely clear, and very comfortable."
8,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very well made, but somewhat difficult to fit in. The real problem: sound quality. These have a nasty mid-range peak that is just plain annoying and unnatural. The sound fine with Audyssey AMP, but I can't us the app for all that much, so I gave up on these. For this kind of money, they need to be way more neutral and pleasant."
9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as an ugrade to my Sennheiser CX-400 earphones. In all regards, these Shure earphones are an upgrade from the Sennheisers. The Sennheisers have a little more bass, but the bass overpowers the mids and highs. The Shures are much more balanced.

I considered Shure 315's and the Triple.Fi 10's from Ultimate Ears. The deciding factor for me was comfort. I use earphones when I'm going to sleep, so I need to be able to wear them and rest the side of my head on a pillow. Because these earphones angle back along your ear rather than stick out like the TF10's, they work very well in this application.

There is a lot to like about these earphones. The cable is thick and robust without being unwieldy. The earpieces are solidly constructed, very comfortable, and fit well in my ears. They have excellent isolation with no microphonic effects from the cable. The nylon case is nice and holds the earphones well. These tips are easily replaced and a wide variety are provided, which can be fun to experiment with. I found the medium black foam tips work best for me. I've worn these for a couple of hours and forgot that I had them in.

I found these earphones to benefit greatly from break in. Initially, I was very dissapointed by the sound quality - the bass was severely lacking and the treble had no sparkle. After using them for a few days (6 or 7 hours of listening), they suddenly opened up. So be patient and give these earphones a chance.

I dinged a star only because of the sound quality. Compared to my Grado SR-225s (which are at the same price point as the Shure 315's), there is something missing in these earphones. Perhaps it's not fair to compare IEM's with open-backed/over-the-ear headphones, but I can't help it since that is my frame of reference.

All things considered, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and look forward to continued musical enjoyment with these earphones."

These headphones are extremely well-made, with foam-like inserts that mold to your ear canal and block out the shrill sounds, while allowing just enough in to be able to interact in the environment when necessary.

I mostly have listened to spoken podcasts, so can't comment on musical sound quality, but can say the volume can be so low these are benefitting hearing/reducing loss by not having to crank them up to drown out noise."
6,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing in ear monitors. Very comfortable to wear little ear fatigue. The sound quality is amazing.

7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great.

Huge downside is the fact that the connection on the earphones cuts out. I only had about 6 hours of use with these before my Left headphone would constantly cut out. If you jiggled and pushed on the cord near the connection it would come back but as soon as you turn your head again it would cut out.

For $200 headphones this should not be an issue. sucks cause I really liked my e4c's and wanted to love these too."

Apparently the cleaning crews NEVER find them :-) Well I was a big fan of the Shure line-up of products. Unfortunately they lost me on the ""new and improved"" system. You must warp the line around your ear for a proper fit. The wire does not want to stay in place and if you dare turn your head they want to come out and you loose the sound quality and sound isolation. I which they would go back to offering the standard type E type earbuds.

Once in and not moving - nothing comes close in quality of sound I think. Up to you if you can live with the wire around the ear."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,It takes a little getting used-to when putting these headphones in your ears. But once you get the motion down it's just an after thought. The foam tips really do a great job at isolating exterior noises. The sound quality is top notch as well. Cyrstal clear across the entire spectrum (at least as far as my ears can tell).
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Years ago I had another set of sure earphones. The Shure SE315-K, Sound Isolating Earphone far exceeded my expectations and I'm very glad I made this purchase. The treble is highly detailed and the base is earth shattering meaning very very good."
4,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start off by saying these are good headphones but not GREAT. They have GREAT build quality however. They are 10x better quality than my Klipsch Custom 3's I am replacing due to the known cable issue. Right out of the box you can tell the cables are high grade and the monitors themselves seem like the will last for years. These earphones are not small but they fit nicely in your ear actually making them much less noticeable than normal headphones.

As far as sound goes these are great in some areas but seem to lack a bit in others. I am not an audiophile however I do own quality products( Shure se315, Bowers & Wilkins P5's and Klipsch Custom 3's) and rip my music in flac or 320 mp3s. The highs are very pronounced and come through with excellent clarity without being overly bright. The mids are solid as well as the bass but seem to lack a little depth. The quality is pretty impressive considering these are only a single driver and they cost about $200. The biggest downfall that these earphones have is the sound stage and separation at times. When a song has a lot going on it almost seems it all mush together.

Overall I would absolutely recommend these earphones especially because of the outstanding build quality and lasting value. Shure has set the standard for build quality that many other companies will struggle to live up to."

7,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stop Reading reviews and purchase these earbuds. Shure makes impressive in-ear monitors and these will not dissapoint. These are best for portable non amplified listeners. If you have a headphone amp then I would go with the Shure 425s but these 315s perform amazingly with or without a headphone amplifier. And detachable cables and foam sleeves are a big PLUS!

9,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"(A) Ergonomics
I'm sure everyone's ears are different. For me, any tip one these earphones was laborious to insert into my ears. I tried several times a day for a week and I never got much better at inserting these. I did not have this problem with my old Shure E3c, my new Etymotic ER-4Ps, or a Monster Turbine I tried. I fault the backwards setup (rather than direct into the ear) of these earphones.

(B) Poor Bass
When the buds are sealed properly, the bass is weak. Compared to the Etymotic ER-4Ps, it's a no brainer to ditch the Shures. When I had the previous generation Shure E3c, I remember the Etymotics being a step better in bass but not this much.

(C) Useless Noise Isolation
Perhaps due to my difficulties, the design of the drivers, or from the thinness of the foam tips provided, the noise isolation on these phones was minimal. In a side-by-side comparison to Etymotic ER-4Ps, the Shures blocked out what seemed like an order of magnitude LESS office noise. The Etymotic ER-4Ps cost a bit more, but the few bucks are worth never hearing anyone around me talking while playing music at low volume.

Seriously, skip this product. Buy an Etymotic ER-4P or Westone etc. The Etymotic cord is more dainty, but you can record it for $50-60 via outside vendors (different material) or from Etymotic. Frankly, if I'm paying $200 for a pair of Shures, I can put in a bit more for something that actually works."

Started appreciating IEMs with Shure's E2s, which seemed the right price for iTunes music years ago. What they lacked in both the basses and highs, the sense of air you get with great headphones, they more than made up for in mid-range clarity and presence. Excellent for casual listening in an environment where I'm doing something else along with listening to music (which I rarely do, preferring complete focus).

I listen to everything, classical extensively, rap and electronic dance, country, music from around the world, you name it. I'm listening to Daft Punk's latest as I type this.

The SE315s are, well, just perfect. Not only is there a presence to the sound, the bass is TIGHT, which matters way more to me than sheer thump and volume. The transients, which are what I love hearing clearly the most, because they're where the life of a musical sound lives, are precise, and energetic, and free of distortion. This is what gives the SE315s that sense of being able to reveal things you haven't heard before.

No disrespect to the Sennheiser IEMs; they are very neutral as well, and I love 'em, but they're not as rugged as these, so I save them for special listening sessions.

At less than half the price of those, these are perfect all-rounders. I'm not sure I'd use them to master an album, but maybe that's just pretense on my part; the more I listen, the more I'm amazed.

The sign of a good IEM, and not just because of the isolation, is that you can turn the music DOWN and still hear everything.

In my experience, only these and the IE8s have accomplished this for earbuds. The top of the line Etymotics, as well.

But the SE315s are what I'll take with me everywhere. I look forward to many years of pleasure and reliability from them."
1,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd buy these again. They're the only ones that allow me to push my wheelchair and stay in my ears without me having to mess with them every few minutes. I love the huge array of earbud covers they give you, and they come in a very cool zippered case that I'm still using today. The sound quality is superb. I just can't go back to buying crappy earbuds."
2,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,A little awkward to get around the ears at first but you'll get the hang of it quickly. Great selection of buds so you'll have no problem getting a great fit for fairly high end sound. Some of the CD s on my new iPod are over 27 yrs old. Hear things I never knew were there. I consider somewhat of an audiophile so I have very high expectations. But they are worth the price.
3,Shure SE315-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had a a pair of Shure E4c for a long time that I have been very happy with, especially when travelling. These beat them with a good margin. Same good sound insulation but with much better sound. Somewhat surprised by the big difference between them. These are definitely the best earphones I have used the only question is if they are worth the money of if you might as well go with the cheaper version."
