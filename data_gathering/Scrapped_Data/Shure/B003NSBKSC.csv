0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In short, these are the best IEM's I've ever tried, but I'm not 100% convinced that they're worth $300.

I'm not really an audiophile, but I did a lot of research on IEMs (earbuds that sit deep in the ear), and I thoroughly tested a few of my finalists. So, in this review I'm going to compare the Shure SE215's ($99), Shure SE425's ($299), and Etymotic Research ER-4PT's ($299). My main selection criteria were comfort, sound quality, and ability to block out outside noise (note that for this reason I first tried the Bose QuietComfort 20i's, but the active noise canceling pressure made my ears hurt).

SHORT SUMMARY: I easily recommend the SE215's in terms of price-performance; but, if you have more to spend then get the SE425's. The ER-4PT's are very crisp, but they have some significant physical downsides.

LONGER REVIEW:

First of all, I hear that it's important to choose headphones based on the kind of music that you listen to. So, for my tests, I used ten songs representing my favorite genres of EDM (house/trance), synthpop, and pop rock. Songs included Instant Crush (Daft Punk), Good Morning Kaia (BT), Crush (Dave Matthews Band), and A Sky Full of Stars (Coldplay).

Overall, the SE215's are excellent, especially for the price. When switching back and forth between them and the 425's, I could notice a clear difference, but not necessarily a $200 difference. If $200 isn't a huge deal to you, definitely get the 425's; but, I think you'd have to be a very discerning listener to really appreciate the increase in quality.

So what's better about them? Everything is clearer. After listening to the 425's, the 215's feel almost like a light blanket was thrown over the speaker -- everything is just a little muddier and the individual instruments are less clear. There's less separation between the layers. But again, this wasn't a dramatic difference, so you'd still be very safe with the 215's (and I understand that $300 is an insane amount of money for most people to spend on earbuds).

What about the ER-4PT's? They were even clearer, but almost clinically so. It felt a bit like I was in a perfectly empty room listening to every little nuance of the sound, but that sound was less warm than that of the Shures. To be honest, though, this difference was minimal -- in most cases, there wasn't a hugely noticeable difference between the ER-4PT's and the SE425's. I most preferred the Etymotics in songs involving crisp cymbals and complex background noises; but again, it wasn't a huge difference, and overall I slightly preferred the warmer bass of the Shures.

More importantly, I found two dealbreakers that meant I couldn't keep the Etymotics: (1) That crisp clarity of sound sadly translated to the wire as well; every time I moved my head I could powerfully feel/hear the wire moving, to the point that it was quite distracting. I believe that this is called microphonics. (2) The plastic piece connecting the wire going to each ear was surprisingly heavy, to the point that its weight very quickly became annoying compared to the other earbuds.

The other nice thing about the Shures is how easily they slip into your ears. Fair warning that it took me a while to figure out how to get them in right -- I was about to return them because it was so confusing at first, but I watched a youtube video and realized you have to actually significantly bend the rubbery part. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fast and easy to fit them in compared to the Etymotics that I really had to work in every time while holding my ear open with my other hand.

So, like I said, I recommend either one of the Shures depending on how much money you can spare on headphones. One other tip, by the way: Be very careful about trying all the different types of tips that are included. I noticed a dramatic difference when I finally found the right set that made a truly tight seal in my ear canal -- the bass became significantly stronger and the overall sound became tighter and cleaner.

Overall, I definitely recommend IEMs over regular earbuds (unless you're riding a bike or something that demands attention), but keep in mind that none of these will fully block out nearby voices on their own -- I needed to play white noise or music to achieve the true isolation I was looking for.

UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER WEEK:

After going back and forth some more between these and the 215's, I can safely say that the 425's are clearly better for anything but casual background listening. For certain songs especially, the 215's now sound like they're covered in a blanket when immediately compared to the 425's -- they're just much duller, muted, and bass-heavy. I'd still certainly recommend them for the price, but I've decided to spend a little more and keep the 425's."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in December 2014, upgrading after owning the SE215-K and SE315-K. The sound quality is great, and a distinct improvement over the prior two. But other reviewers have spoken to that.

Yesterday when I went to remove the earbuds from my ear, the plastic at the base of the sleeve where it connects to the main body broke. This happened a few months ago, to the left side. I was able to send it in to be repaired, and I expect to be able to do so again under the 2-year warantee. However, this seems to be a weakness in the design that causes it to wear out after a bit over a year.

UPDATE: Original purchase: 12/2014 ; Left side sent for repair: 11/2015 ; Right side sent for repair: 9/2016

For $300, I expect the ear buds themselves to last for many years even if I have to replace the cables. So I would not buy these again."
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now owned these, the 215 and 315. I still have and use the 315's as my work headphones. I noticed a difference between the 215 and 315, but honestly, I can't tell the difference between the 315 and 425, except that I paid an extra $100 for them.

That said, the 315 sounds great and is all-day comfortable. I wore them for 8+ hours a day on multiple weekends last summer while working on a project in the backyard. I was running a table, mitre or circular saw all day long, and not only did they effectively block the noise from my saws, I could clearly hear the music above the noise of those saws without ever having to increase the volume of my music beyond what was comfortable without the saws running.

In short, the 425 is a nice earbud, but I can't say it's a dramatic leap in build or sound quality over the 315. As a tip, the black cable is less durable than the clear cable. Go for the clear."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. If you have done your homework you know these are not big heavy bass filled buds, and that is completely true. But the audio is crisp and clean, and I have never felt/experienced such a great and comfortable fit- in terms of both comfort and sound isolation. The cord wrapping around your ear design is very cool, though a little less convenient for those with glasses I found.

The replaceable cord is an awesome idea. In reality I found my left earbud in particular would disconnect quite easily. I could easily slide the right one in but about half the time on the left one the cord would pop out. A couple times while quickly wrapping the cord up after work a bud would fling off. For this reason I ended up returning them- I suspect my pair was defective because of how much easier the left bud came disconnected, but even still I found it a nuisance.

Verdict: If you are not worried about the price tag, and are looking for fantastic ear buds for the home or use with an instrument, I would definitely recommend these. If you are looking for earbuds to wear daily on the go, I would avoid. I bought them hoping to do double duty, but I was hoping for too much, will buy separate piano headphones and music earbuds :)"
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke my Shure E3C earbuds after almost seven years of faithful service. I crazy glued the stem back onto the earbud and the buds still work, but I felt nervous about the stem breaking again and getting stuck in my ear. So I decided to get a new set and was wavering between the SE315's and the SE425's. The 315's are probably close to the equivalent to what I was replacing, but the other reviews I read for the 425's praised their better bass response (deep, but clean), the wider range, and the superior noise isolation. So I decided to spend the extra hundred dollars to upgrade to the 425's. I am very happy that I did. My old E3C's were great, and I would guess the SE315's would be equally good, but the 425's are a significant step up. I have a wide taste in music but at least half the time I am listening to classical, so strong, clean bass, and a wide range to handle every orchestra instrument and the occasional classical vocal piece are essential. I'm also in airplanes every week so sound isolation is important.

I might mention that in addition to my old E3C's I also have a set of Bose Quiet Comfort 15's, bought when I thought noise cancellation might be better than noise isolation. I was wrong. The Bose are great at killing jet engine noise, and are truly eye-watering in a turboprop, but they don't cancel out babies and rude adults. The E3C's did a pretty good job of those problems, but the 425's are really amazing when it comes to sound isolation. With no music playing, I can still hear conversations, but they are very muffled. With music playing, even at fairly low levels, there is no ambient noise to intrude. Somehow, Shure tweaked the angle of the earbuds so they get a perfect seal. That being said, the 425's would be truly dangerous to wear while jogging or cycling.

So about the sound quality of the 425's. Better than the E3C's; better than the Bose QC15's - but not quite at the audiophile level. My guess is you need to spend considerably more to get something that will sound as good as a quality THX-certified home surround system. On my home system, I can pick out exactly where a particular orchestra instrument is placed. Can't do that with the 425's but the stereo separation is very good and gives you the full depth you would expect. The quality of the 425's allow me to listen at lower volume levels, which is far less fatiguing (and quite a bit better for the ears!). The quality of the bass presentation I noticed when I played my Boston Pops recording of 76 Trombones. This piece has bass and kettle drums plus a tuba. On my E3C's and the Bose QC15's all three instruments sound the same and kind of mush together. On the 425's I can hear the difference between the drums and the tuba, and the sounds remain distinct. If you've never used noise isolating earbuds before, it is absolutely critical to get a good seal in your ear - otherwise the bass will be very weak. If you can clearly hear the conversations around you, you don't have a good seal. Conversations should sound almost like you're under water if you have the earbuds inserted correctly.

A couple quibble points. As other reviewers mention, getting the foam sleeves off that the 425's ship with is no small task. Even using the trick of putting them in the freezer isn't a quick fix. Knowing that the stems the sleeves fit on are fragile, it took me almost 15 minutes of gentle twisting and pulling to get the foam sleeves off. Hey Shure, how about shipping the 425's without the sleeves installed? The good news is, if you don't use foam sleeves, the other sleeves (soft rubber in three sizes, and yellow memory foam) are much easier to get on and off. And once you find the right sleeve for you, you will never have to mess with that problem again. The other quibble I have is the semi-rigid, 3"" wire cover adjacent to the bud. This wire should be bent to the curvature of the outside of your ear to help keep the bud securely installed. It absolutely does that; there is no way these buds are going to fall out accidentally. But the wire also makes the buds much harder to install in the first place. Getting the buds inserted and secured is a two-hand task, and takes a while even once you think you have the hang of it.

If the quality of sound and excellent noise isolation are critical to you,and you don't plan to use them for jogging or cycling, and you can live with the quibbles I mentioned, these are the earbuds to buy!"
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still marvel at it! A phenomenal achievement. NOT for bassheads. Dual balanced armature (not dynamic) driver, with a very capable, built in cross-over network, the SE425's offers an analytical interpretation of the audiophile experience. Bass is ample, when it is indicated in the mastering of the track, but it shines in its above average rendering of upper-mids to highs. Shure's signature sound is to emphasis the uppers and high mids, so it is true to that sound. To this day, after owning it for over 6 months now, I still marvel at its capability. It is accurate and detailed, without being fatiguing, and the sound stage, tho not vast, is good enough. My only reservation is to perhaps invest in the SE535's for a fuller expression of the low mids, to lows. I often tinker with the idea of upgrading to the 535's or even the SE846's."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, very accurate sound from an earphone. They have a more realistic spacious sound than the SE210s I had before these. Other headphones that emphasize bass or some other range make some music sound great and other music sound really crummy. These ones make all music sound great. Some might complain that the bass sounds weak, but that's because they're used to 'phones that exaggerate bass. Bass can be made to *almost* thump on these using equalizer settings on a player, but most of the time it sounds better without.

I've had them for close to a year and a half now. It takes some practice before you get used to putting them in, but once you've got it down, the new shape is great and lets them lie flatter in your ear. Having the wire go around your ear reduces cable noise when you move around. The included selection of sleeves is excellent, though after trying a bunch I ended up using the ones that came pre-installed, the 2-dot black foam ones. They can be a little finicky to get in correctly, but if done right they stay comfortable for extended listening sessions.

Having the cable be replaceable is brilliant, and more high end headphones need to start doing it. Headphone wires always seem to eventually get brittle when I use them, something about my skin oil I think. This one is the only one I've used for this long that hasn't, so it's an excellent quality cable, but I'm still very glad it will be replaceable when something finally does happen to it.

The cable is absurdly long at 60 inches. This would be great for use with a stereo or desktop computer. For portable use you end up with quite a bit of extra cable. I preferred the older way, where the cable is just long enough for a phone or iPod in a shirt pocket, and an extension wire is included for when you want it longer. I ultimately ended up cutting it to a more sensible length and splicing it together. If they offered a shorter one as an accessory, I'd have bought that."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They are, by far, the best headphones I have ever owned, or even used for that matter. My only complaint is that I wish they produced more bass, but I was warned and made aware of that before I bought them. They are comfortable for hours on end; although for the first few days to a week, after a few hours they become uncomfortable, but after that you get used to them and it is no longer an issue. They also stay put. They will not fall out even if you pull, hard, on them. To really appreciate these, you need a high quality audio source, but they offer an improvement with any audio source. Also, removing the foam tips that come attached from the factory is very difficult, but once you change them the first time it gets easier after that. I had to pull so hard I thought I was going to break the headphones or tear the foam tips. My complaints are pretty minor though and the pros far outweigh any minor issues. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I will always buy Shure headphones in the future, as long as I can afford them."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After all the rave reviews I was looking forward to getting these. I have never had in-the-ear phones before, so maybe it is just me, but I could get practically no bass out of these. I tried several of different size/type of ""inserts"" with them, but unless I forcibly kept them pushed into my ear canal, no bass. Tried all different types of music/songs. I was only able to get fairly decent low end when I hooked up my mp3 player through a FiiO A5 headphone amp, with output boost and bass boost on. Also had bass boosted in my mp3 player EQ. They did have excellent clear high and mid range (and bass when I forced the issue). So these headphones didn't work out for me and I returned them."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these headphones. I am a drummer and use them for personal playing, gigs and in church. The dual drives are great for my needs, I wouldn't want a single drive for my needs. The amount of tips it comes with are nice to have, it gives you options for a comfortable fit or different places you are playing in.

The fit and comfort is superb. I found initially they didn't pick up the low ends, but after using them more and breaking them in they pick up the low ends better. Really making a nice balanced sound; which is great playing live as you want to hear all the instruments and vocalists.

I would buy again, but with shure's quality they should last quite awhile."
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BACKGROUND: I owned the SE310 headphones in 2009 and had them replaced with a Best Buy gift card because the cable split at the ear loop while the headphones were under warranty. I can attest that it was a thin, brittle cable on otherwise very good sounding headphones.

REVIEW: Out of the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of the SE425-CL. The cable and connectors have been reinforce, particularly around the ear loop. These ship with the pictured foam tips installed. When I listened to the headphones for the first time with these tips, I was disappointed in nearly all aspects except for the mid-range. The headphones didn't make a good seal in my ear canal.

I cannot stress enough, these headphones, and others in the Shure SE line, REQUIRE a very good seal to sound their best. They should fit like very firm ear plugs so that you will literally have to pinch the casing and pull the tip out of your ear. Once I switched out the small foam tips with the large ones, the sound was excellent. They block out so much sound. You will not hear your neighbor in the gym on the treadmill. In fact, it takes a some adjustment to only being able to hear the impact of your feet on the ground when you're walking with these on.

The bass is entirely adequate and balanced with the mid range and highs. It won't rumble your ears or sound like a 10"" home stereo subwoofer or a car subwoofer, but it's enough to vibrate your ears a little and they faithfully reproduce all the low notes in a song like ""Put On"" by Jeezy, which I always use to test out bass."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not consider myself an audiophile, but I do believe to have a discerning ear. The Shure SE425-V's would represent the most that I have ever paid for a set of ear bud's and or head phones, but here goes.
These are a bit tricky to get in your ear correctly, but once you have figured out which little foam pieces fit properly in your ear and with a bit of practice they seem to drop in and fit very and I mean very comfortably and for the first time I now have a pair of ear buds that actually stay put as opposed to falling out of the ear while your hands are occupied. I have read that one must be careful not to remove these by pulling on the cable as this will provide the user with premature failures of the cable and I can see this happening as the cables look to be a bit on the delicate side.
As for ambient sound blocking they do a wonderful job, as I purchased these to use while on the motorcycle I am now having doubts as to whether that is a good idea, having the surrounding sounds dampened so much, may leave one in a state of isolation, you can hear loud noises (such as a blast from a horn), but they are subdued quite a bit, which says much for design of these ear pieces, but also may leave one enjoying the listening rather than paying attention to the surrounding traffic (while driving).
I have read that these ear buds lack the bass response that one would be looking for while listening to some styles of music, I did have success in adjust the EQ to increase the bass response to my listening pleasure, but I am in the grey hair crowd so my bass distinction may
be quite different than yours.
Sound quality is spectacular in my humble opinion, sound is full of rich detail from the highs to the lows, would I purchase these again, shure would, opps sure would as well as recommend them to a friend."
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are amazing. For those who want to pump as much bass as possible into an earphone, look elsewhere. For anyone else who wants a solid, warm, balanced sound that does an accurate job of reproducing music, these are some magnificent earphones, even at this high price tag.

Fit: Great (after a while)
Those who are unaccustomed to the Shure wearing experience, this may be an initial turn-off, as you really need to place them deep into the ear canal to get a good isolation to achieve maximum sound clarity. The SE 425 deep in-ear canal feel will feel a bit uncomfortable at first (your ears need to get used to the pressure,) but once you are used to it, you can't live without the secure feeling of never having to worry about the earphones falling out, and you no longer feel any discomfort.

Sound: Wonderful (for a balanced sound experience)
Again these are not for bass junkies, but offer a more balanced sound reproduction for all levels. The sound is beautiful, rich and warm, and can offer a great listening experience with different genres of music. I myself use a portable amp with earphones and can adjust the EQ to whatever I want, and the SE 425s perform even better at many levels."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a prior statement before I write this review these are my first IEMS. I am no audio genius, nor am I an audio electronics expert; my understanding is limited to basic principles and applications.

Now that everything is out of the way, let's move onto the review; first, these headphones are extremely analytical and clean-sounding. These are not bassy IEMS, nor are they a sparkly-sounding"" treble IEMS—these are natural, balanced sounding headphones with a fast and punchy bass sound. To some, this may make the in-ears sound ""weak"". However, I would disagree and say the bass is sufficient and exists to a point where you know it is there—but you also know that the bass would not bleed into the treble. These in-ears sound fantastic with just about every genre in my opinion; but they particularly shine with classical music, traditional musics, (particularly from Japan and China) music with an emphasis on vocals such as folk, gospel, and choir—as well as rock music. Electronic musics also sounds good; even bassy tracks sounded fantastic, and you can hear sounds you never would of noticed with basic headphones or headphones with an emphasis on lows and bass. I suppose that is the trade-off; clarity over power. That would most likely sum up the IEMS as a whole; they are IEMS for someone who wants clarity and neutrality in sound above all else—perhaps you are someone who listens to a large variety of music and cannot decide on a particular sound signature—or perhaps you just listen to music without an emphasis on bass. The choice is up to you my friend."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had some Sure E3's that failed after many years of abuse, so I thought I'd try the sure brand again. I was looking for the E4's on a recommendation of a friend and found these as the upgraded option. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I play the bass and wanted to have something that would give an accurate bass response. These are absolutely great for bass! But they shine in all areas.

PROS: The music quality is great to me. I have had several brands over the years including Bose, Sony, Monster, etc. These sound great compared to all of those. I expected a high quality sound for the price and I wan't disappointed. Since these are stage quality headphones they really need to be able to seal off well and reduce the outside noise. The headphones come with several options for ear pieces, the foamy black rubber ones work best for me. I sit right behind the drum set and very close to the piano but I still have control of their volume levels with these headphones in. I used to have the piano turned all the way down on our AVIOM system b/c the noise would bleed through my E3's but now I can actually use the volume knob on the piano as it should be. I also use these when flying to block out sound and watch movies. It's like having a surround system in your head. Very, very nice.

A big pro that I haven't used yet is the detachable cords. Often times the cord is the weak link in a pair of headphones. With these, if the cord breaks you can just replace it. Very nice.

CONS: These things are not jogging headphones! They are big and relatively heavy. Don't misunderstand, they are perfect for a stage or sitting and watching a movie or listening to music. But they are large and wouldn't be a great workout headphone in my opinion. That's not their design. Plus, they block out too much noise to be safe when running down the road.

The headphone jack is large. I wouldn't fit my iphone case so I whittled it out a little. I know it's for durability, just saying so you'd be aware.

OVERALL: These headphones are GREAT at what they are designed to be. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who want a higher end headphone to block out the outside world and provide awesome sound for music or movies."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound Isolation is almost complete. This can be problematic when walking around and should be taken into account. The sound quality is fantastic. You will hear details in your favorite music you had never heard before. As for the sound profile I'd say its pretty balanced from mid to high but lacks in bass. The bass is present and very tight but again it is not bass heavy. The fit is great but there is a bit of a learning curve as to how they fit into your ears. I could see these being very uncomfortable for people with smaller ears as there is quite a lot of headphone to stuff in there. The build quality is high in accordance with their price. Something to add is that mid range vocals sound especially good. The only genre that didn't sound as good for me is Jazz. Because of the lack of bass and warmth it just doesn't really blow my mind. Electronic music is finding its way into my library as these headphones are stellar for this genre in particular. The precision and dynamic response to these headphones really provides a good amount of pep into some tracks.
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line, for headset sound, you can't do much better than Shure. These are replacing my old SE310's which sounded fantastic held up for 4 or 5 years (so long I can't quite remember when I purchased them). With the dual drivers, the new SE425s sound much richer and definitely better, The sound isolation is probably 10-15 db better as well. The headset probably exceeds the quality of the decoding on my iPhone but for direct connect to my stereo or as a headset for my radio show, they are perfect.

Here's whats missing: My SE310 had a cord that separated in the middle. This was a great feature for the times when the cord gets caught in something when you turn your head or stand up. The separator would detach which would prevent any damage to my iPhone and/or potential injury to my ears. The new SE425s do not have this great feature. I wish Shure would have included the inline mic with volume control on the cord. I'm sure they will make an extra $30-$40 wholesale by selling a separate cord, but really, if I buy the separate cord I am not going to switch back and forth to the original cord, so it is a waste. Why not offer the SE425 with or without the inline mic as separate SKUs? Its almost inconceivable to me that Shure did not make the 3.5mm mini plug with a narrow offset for plugging into an iPhone that has a thick case on it. Really? Come on, the iPhone has been out for how many years now? Shame on you.

If not for these three missing features, I'd rate them 5 star.

Finally, I've only had these for about one week. The longest I've worn them is 4 hours and they have been very comfortable. Time will tell if they are less comfortable as they get used or when I am wearing them for 6-8 hours."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got my Shure SE425 earbuds......wow! So I don't normally write reviews because I don't want to take the time to, but I just got these in the mail and felled compelled to write one. I have been waiting for a solid week, and they finally came, the tension was building up and I am not disappointed at all! These are absolutely amazing.

I am no audiophile, but even I can tell the difference in sound compared to anything else I've listened to. The have really clear sound and claim to be sound-isolating...depending on the ear sleeves you use, I could argue that they are sound cancelling. They have beautiful sound; the basses are pronounced, but don't drown the music (especially if you listen to rap). They sound amazing with classical, and best of all, they are amazing for country that typically has a neutral sound.

The fit is absolutely perfect. Play around with the ear tips to find the perfect fit....trust me, the perfect fit is included, just try them all on. Because they fit flush against your ear, they are super comfy to fall asleep in; they don't dig into your ear and hurt after a while like other earbuds that stick out do. Although they are a little pricy, there is a reason....they are worth every penny if you have the money! It was way past my budget as a student, but I could not resist and I do not regret the purchase at all!"
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play bass at my church and they have the Aviom systems for in ear monitoring. They have several pairs of the SE315 model ear phones which are single driver and they aren't too bad but can sound a little thin. I was mostly getting grossed out by sharing monitors with other people so I decided to get my own and upgrade to Shure's next highest model while I was at it. First of all these aren't going to thump your ears out like Beats headphones. They are very clear, detailed monitors. They have more bottom end then the SE315 models but they are crystal clear and not muddy. I would say there is more bass presence but not necessarily booming bass. I can clearly hear everything that is going on on the stage without ringing ears afterwards. In my opinion these are the best in ears you can get for the money before getting into custom models. For live monitoring music performance situations they work perfectly for me. I play bass without an on stage amp and I can hear the bass loud and clear with these. The SE315's have distortion with lower frequencies but I do not experience that with these in ears."

I could go on and on for over the ear isolation headphones. These are hands down so much better. The sound quality is amazing, you don't loose any bass, the EQ is very flat, and the attenuation is better than any over the ears, so you don't need the volume as loud. The quick release makes it easy to just plug them in when you walk on stage. Also, over the ear headphones let a lot of sound in if you rock out, open your mouth so your jaw bone shifts, or move your head too much. Over the ears cord also gets in the way more. This wire goes over your ears and behind, or under you chin tightly. The only down side is if your band members speak to you, you can't just slide your headphones off. Signals must be visual, or in the mic."

8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow these earphones are truly incredible! I actually prefer them over my Bose Quietcomfort 3 Noise cancelling headphones; music at all levels is significantly crisper and cleaner (they actually block out more noise too). Lots of people complain about the lack of bass in these but once you have them properly inserted I found the bass to be nearly perfect, not over powering but it certainly has a presence while still being accurate. Also I was worried about the in ear design not being comfortable, but once you find the right tip you can wear them for hours on end. I love to ski while listening to some good music and with my old Skullcandy's I would always find myself cranking up the volume so I could hear my music clearly, in turn drowning out my surroundings. With the Shure's they sit so well in the ear canal that I leave my volume all the way down and can hear every beat and lyric clearly, which is perfect for helping you maintain your rhythm but still safely hear the skiers around you. The ability to switch cords to the MPA cord which controls your iphone is also a huge plus while skiing or working out. You really can't say enough about these earphones, I thought I was stupid for spending $300 on earphones but after a couple uses it is totally justified."

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Leí mucho antes de comprar este auricular. Son muchos los atributos que tiene el 425: cable reforzado y reemplazable, jack de primera clase y un sonido balanceado, sólo por citar algunos. No obstante, si debo resaltar algo, es la claridad del sonido y la excelente separación de los instrumentos; cada uno puede escucharse con una nitidez impresionante. En cuanto a las quejas por la falta de graves, a mí no me afecta. Encontré el capuchita perfecta para lograr un sellado adecuado del canal auditivo y listo; los bajos están muy presentes, pero sin restarle nada a los medios y agudos -prefiero un sonido balanceado y plano, a uno exagerado y agresivo que bloquea al resto-.
Resulta increíblemente emocionante volver a escuchar mis discos con el SE425; siempre descubro algo nuevo, un matiz, una pizca sonora que antes no estaba y que ahora sí. Es como redescubrir la música. Escucho un poco de todo: clásica, rock, punk, etc. y la verdad es que lo estoy disfrutando, y mucho. La música clásica suena simplemente inmaculada, no puedo encontrar otro adjetivo para describir lo que oigo, mientras que los clásicos como Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin y otros ganan en nitidez y fuerza. Discos más nuevos como los de Tv on The Radio LCD Soundsystem, simplemente te van a volar la cabeza. No le pongo 5 porque no existe nada perfecto, y en ese sentido debo decir que un aspecto a mejorar del auricular es la comodidad y el confort ya que no puedes tenerlo puesto de seguido más de dos horas. Por el resto, recomendaría este auricular a cualquiera que de verdad le gusta la música como para gastar unos dólares más."

I bought these to replace a stolen set of SE-530s. The tube on my 530s got slightly twisted when I replaced the tips on those. The sound was still excellent, so I kept them. On the 425s the tube snapped. I don't know what they use to attach these tips at the factory, but it seems like superglue!

4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi Everyone,
I just received my SE425's 2 days ago, and have had ample time to ""break them in"". After spending almost $300, I'm not sure if they're exactly as I expected. I previously had the Shure E2C, SE210, and SE310; all of them were wonderful in their own ways at their price points.

However, the SE425 have very similar sound to the now-discontinued and discounted SE310 even with two discrete drivers, while costing more (after SE310 price discounts). The cables are too rigid near the ears, making for uncomfortable wearing. Also, the nozzles/earpieces don't go as deep in the ear canal as previous models, but surprisingly without sacrificing sound isolation. The bass is too understated, even compared to Shure's ""flat-sound"" standards. The detachable cables are an amazing innovation (finally implemented), especially since my previous models have gone through 3-4 cable warranty repairs (crackling sound) while the drivers themselves were perfectly fine.

Beware, the earphone plug-in piece is quite large, making it very difficult to fit in iPhone/MP3 player cases (especially the iPhone 1st gen and iPhone 4 w/ bumper). The previous Shure models didn't have this problem, as their plug points were quite narrow.

Overall, the Shure SE425 seems more durable than previous models, but their high price point with only marginal improvements makes it slightly difficult to justify over previous Shure models, which are now heavily discounted.

I'm do not claim to be an audiophile who listens to music only through Amps and such, though I do value and understand quality audio. I mainly use these headphones with my iPhone 4 and laptop with higher bitrate songs (320 KPBS+ VBR).

Hopefully this helps, and good luck in your earphone search!!"

7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have SE530 and gave it 5 stars. I tried both the new SE535 and this SE435. These new earphones fit more snug therefore produce more bass. As a result the SE535 has overwhelming bass drowning out everything else while the original SE530 have a much better balance. The SE435 has a much better balance than the SE535. I have tried many other in ear headphones in the past. I tried top of the line from Sony,audio technica, Etomotics and I have even owned $1000 custom molded UE10 but I like both the SE435 and SE530 better. Shure simply has the technology down and produce the best balance among all in ear headphone which I have tried. Others simply do not sound natural nor are they musical.

9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned a pair of Shure e2c's and Monster Turbine earphones (not to mention countless cheap pairs and an okay set of Sennheiser CX300's), I decided I was going to treat myself with some holiday money and get these 425's.

Like my beloved e2c's, they came with a variety of different earpieces and a nice carrying case. I went straight for the foam, plugged these in to my iPod, and experienced... well... disappointment. Thinking that this was clearly my fault, I decided to break them in, knowing full well that the benefits of doing so with earphones is not very well substantiated. Then I decided to try again with DVD audio and vinyl tracks on my Yamaha receiver to ensure it wasn't just the compression that was ruining the experience.

What I've concluded is that the 425's are absolutely stellar for live, choral, and jazz music. Seriously, Dave Brubeck has never sounded so good. But I had to temper that with the fact that pop, rock, and electronic music really suffer on the low end. And, I found myself continually pushing on the earphones, as though they weren't in as far as they needed to be. Sure, the seal was perfect, but for some reason, I just wasn't getting the bass. I tried other earpieces, but they generally sounded the same or worse -- keeping in mind too, that my ear canals aren't unusually shaped, and I know how to form a proper seal.

As far as highs and mids, the 425's absolutely sparkle. But there's an almost unnerving lack of ""presence"" that only seems to come with a lot of EQ changes. So while they're certainly some of the clearest earphones I've ever used, they're not the best. Yes, you can hear the floor creaking on a John Coltrane track, and it's pretty amazing. But that in itself doesn't make a song more enjoyable to listen to. And frankly, I don't think that the sound reproduction of a finished track is more ""true"" with the 425's so much as the mids are very detailed.

If you were using these as monitors (which admittedly, Shure loosely suggests), you're getting a great deal on great earphones. But for the vast majority of purchasers who want to plug these in to an iPod or stereo receiver, they're just not very impressive for general use."

1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having been an audiophile for years, let me tell you that these headphones are nothing short of amazing. I did my fair share of research on multiple sets before determining these were the ones I wanted. In the discussion were the Grado GR8, Klipsch Image X10, Shure SE535, Shure SE425, Monster Miles Davis Tributes, and Monster Turbine Pro Gold. After weighing out price, value for the price, and general consensus based on hundreds of reviews, I settled on these guys and am by NO MEANS disappointed at all. One of the biggest things I was afraid of was a supposed drop in the low end frequency response according to quite a few reviews. I'm not the kind of person that demands over-bearing bass, I just want it to be there in the amount that its supposed to be there (For reference, I listen mostly to rock/jazz and a little bit of rap/hip-hop). My suspicions are that those who claim there is a lack of bass did not have a proper seal, because I experienced the same problem until I found my ideal tips (Triple-flange sleeves or the medium foam tips, triple flange sleeves provide a better seal but aren't as comfortable which is the reason for the loss of one star in the ""Fit"" category but they are still great). Once I got this seal, the SQ just popped and everything sounded just as it should. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by the low end but the mids and highs lived up to my expectations that had been built up by the many reviews. These guys really perform at a high level like the reviews say and they really do epitomize what Shure SQ is all about. Aside from SQ, the new cord is awesome, nice and sturdy, I have virtually no expectation that this will break, and even if by some freak accident it did, Shure has made them replaceable! Though I cant comment on the SE535's honestly as I have not heard them myself, I cannot imagine they are significantly better than these and definitely not for the $200 price jump. My decision was primarily between the SE535's and the SE425's and I am glad I saved myself the extra 200 bucks and got these. These are no doubt my new favorite earbuds and will serve me well for many years to come."
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel a lot, and I go through earphones once every year or so because I lose them or break them. I've had Shure SE530, SE535, UE Triple.Fi 10 and now these SE425. I'd have to say, out of all those earphones, SE425s are probably the best combination of cost and performance. I did buy SE535 thinking that the newer model would be a perfect replacement for my lost set of SE530, and it was. However, Shure made the SE535's bass noticeably richer than SE530, the perfect balance of SE530 was gone. They still sounded fantastic, so I used them for a few months until my yorkie puppy chewed them to bits. Deciding whether to shell out almost $200 for repair or try out another model, Amazon was running Black Friday promotion where UE Triple.Fi 10 was under 100 bucks, so I ordered them. Well it was a good thing it was under $100, because I would have thrown a fit if I had paid for them at list price. UE Triple.Fi 10 sounded AWFUL! All the reviews said the sound clarity was fantastic, but it just sounded very muddy to me compared to Shure. So I pondered returning it but decided to ""gift"" the UE 10 to my ""audiophile"" friend, and I immediately looked for an alternative, and I ordered the SE425.

Surprisingly the sound coming out from the SE425 is as clear and rich as the SE535, but without that overwhelming bass that I didn't like. Balance-wise I think the SE425 is closer to the SE530 than SE535, and I'd say the overall sound quality from the SE425 is just as good as the SE530. The fit for SE425 is identical to the SE535, but not as comfortable as the SE530. The SE535/425 and SE530 requires different foam tips. I initially used the same foam tips as SE530 (medium black olive type) which made the earbuds fall out constantly, but changing it to yellow foam tips made huge difference in comfort and fit, and my SE535/425 never fell out of my ears.

The fantastic improvement on SE535/425 compared to the venerable SE530 is the cord. The cord is much much sturdier and more flexible than the ones on SE530, and they are detachable from the ""buds"" part. And because the plugs are round, the buds can rotate so that wearing them is much easier than with the SE530.

Well, if my dog chews up my SE425, I'm repairing the SE425, not the SE535. I think I found the perfect earbuds for price and performance. For some people who might have been wanting more bass sound, SE535 would be a better choice but for anyone like me who want clarity and better balance of all ranges, the SE425 seems like a great choice, especially at $200 less than the SE535."

While these are some fantastic sounding IEM's, I need to hold back a star simply because I haven't found them to be worth the hefty price tag. I purchased a set of SE 215's a year ago -- along with some custom molds -- and was very impressed with the clarity and bass; in a quest to achieve an even better listening experience, I shelled out another $300 for the 425's. As I said, they sound great, but I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the 215's and the 425's in a blinded test. My advice? For the money, get the SE215's -- you won't be disappointed."

I own the 215s and was looking for an upgrade, but decided to return the 425s. The 425s have better clarity in the mid and upper mid range but the sound as a whole is unpleasant to my ears. The high end is lacking and so are the low mids. Like other reviewers have stated, the low end is severely understated. And I'm not a bass head. I will admit that I do prefer a slight V sound signature. People rave about the 425 mids but to me they are far too forward. I compared the overall sound signature of the 425s to my JBL LSR305s, which are known to be accurate studio monitors, and they sounded nothing alike. I did not compare soundstage etc. because iems cannot compete with studio monitors. For the price I do not recommend."

The disproportion of high to low does not provide a full, rich sound. I tried all of the combinations of earpieces to try get the best fit but no earpieces really helped. For the price, I would recommend looking elsewhere."

I recently broke a pair of Westone U3 (triple driver) headphones and decided I'd give these Shure SE425-CL a shot and must say they're extremely flat. It honestly sounds like a low end pair of $60-$100 price ranged headphones. The sound isolation is decent but these earphones sound extremely mediocre on most common styles of music. I'm not expecting a ridiculous amount of bass as if I were buying cheap gimmick headphones like Beats by Dre but for the price, there is nothing I can justify keeping these for. The sound quality is just sub-par and totally not inline w/ how much money out of pocket these cost.

1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good:
- Sound sound quality is EXCELLENT -- I have owned SE115, SE215 and the SE425, and while the SE215's are great, you can definitely hear more detail with the SE425, so it is worth the extra money if you are want the additional fidelity.

- The clear ones look AWESOME

The Bad:
- Don't wear well: I have babied mine -- always place in case and handle gently -- however before long you will find your self replacing the cables (3 times now @ ~30 ea), and sending back the earbud for out-of-warranty replacement when the casing separates (about to send back for second time @ ~70)

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE425 is an excellent detailed IEM for Hi Res music.

I started out a year ago with the great all around quality Shure SE215 IEM with single dynamic full range drivers to use with my Pono Hi Res music player. The thing with playing top quality music files on my excellent Pono Hi Res player or any other brand Hi Res player is that you will want the highest quality ears on that you can get for hearing all that extra sound detail. I prefer IEMs, as full around ear headphones kind of heat me up too much. I find Shure IEMs to be more comfortable. Balanced armature drivers power most of the best audiophile quality IEMs, and the Shure SE425 has 2 separate balanced armature drivers in each ear to better separate out the lows from the highs. The result is more sound depth, more detailed sound, and a wider perceived soundstage using the SE425 than I could hear with the SE215. I was also delighted in the strong amount of bass from the SE425 despite many bass critics... You just need to use a sleeve size and type that fits tight to seal your ear canal so you hear all of the bass. Bass is there exactly as it should be with the right foam sleeve, and I listen to all forms of blues, rock, alternative, country... The sound delivered is very detailed & accurate. I can hear much better separation in all of the instruments & different voices on Hi Res tracks using just the Pono - and I am not altering the sound output with an external amp or equalizer, hearing tracks just as the artists intended them to be heard. Instead of every voice being compressed together, now I can better hear and ID the separate voices of a bands vocalists singing in the background. After about 20 hours of use, I can also confirm the comments of some other reviewers....you do benefit after breaking them in for about 10-12 hours and they will begin to sound even better. I bought the clear version SE425 with the clear stock cable, and I found the clear wire a bit stiffer than the black cables that came with the SE215...but two weeks of use later they are a bit more pliable. I appreciated the color coded dots at the coax connectors to identify red for R and blue for L The included hard shell zip case offers good protection for your IEMs plus some spare sleeves, an adapter 1/4"" plug and a cleaning tool. Think the dual balanced armature driver Shure SE425 IEM at $280-299 is the common-sense value sweet spot in the Shure SE series lineup...as adding that much desired 3rd balanced armature driver of the SE535 considerably jacks up the price another $150-200. I have no doubt I would love the SE535 as well, but the better price of the SE425 is much more reasonable.
I can highly recommend the Shure SE425!"
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need to say that I'm a little bit dissapointed. SE425 is a new level of earphones for me since I was using SE215, clarity is a evident improvement, however I stil find the SE 215 to be more useful for me as they seem to handle better higher SPL. I'm a drummer and I was all exited about having my new SE425 earphones, but when I pluged them in my headphones amp I noticed that the low frequencies where not as full as the ones in the SE215. The 425 has more clarity than the 215, but the high frequencies tend to be more ""sensitive"" and to clip in a lower level, same for the low end freq. If you are decided to used them in low level volume, they are definettly good, however from mid and upper levels they didn't work for me. I'll now go and test them in another amp, however, using the exact same amp, I switched inmmediately from the 425 to the 215 when playing and noticed a real improvement with the 215 that I would never think of. As I said, I need to test them with different equipement, but I think that shouldn't be the ideal situation."

For comparison I find them to be much more satisfying across all music genres then my Westone W40’s. I have previously owned se215, 315s, Westone um pro 30’s and se 535 ltds. Honestly I like the soundstage better on these then the 535s and the umpros. Miles better then 315s. Great choice if you’ve got the cash"
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 425's after being disappointed with the 215's and returning them. The dedicated separate drivers seemed to be the difference; the 425 was in a different league. I highly recommend using the triple flange stoppers for the best noise isolation for commuting. Be sure to trim the nipple of the flange that fits over the nozzle so that the molded body of the headphone fits snugly once fully ""screwed"" into the ear canal. If you don't trim it, the body will hang outside the ear cartilage once screwed in - letting unnecessary ambient noise in. Trim it gradually and cautiously to get just the right combination of depth and fit.
Becoming skilled at the insertion of the flanges takes a bit of practice - but it is totally worth it. Lift up ear cartilage and screw the body in about 1/4 turn. Crying babies on the train are no match for the isolation of these wonderful earphones. The $300 are well worth it.
I matched these 425's with the Sony NWZ-A17 MP3 player...what a beautifully matched combination!
I'm a very happy musician who has access to most of my entire music collection for my commute!"
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these to this is a bit knee-jerk but so far I'm extremely happy with these headphones! I had the Shure E4c before and after 2-3 years use the cable started to fail. The new 4-series design has a replaceable cable for about $20, so that won't be a problem going forward. But I was worried about the sound quality of the SE425 the larger earpieces, and the rigid wire that wraps around the ear. Here's what I found:

The earbuds fit very nicely into my ear. Even though they are larger than the E4c the shape is contoured to the ear so they lie flatter. The rigid cable also helps keep them right in place.

The sound is even better! The 4-series is designed to be flat, meaning not overly bassy. Perception of sound ""quality"" depends heavily on the type of music and the user preference. I've tried some of my favs covering the spectrum - Beatles ""Come Together"", Jay-Z ""Hard Knock Life"", Trentemoller ""Moan"", Otis Redding ""Just One More Day"", and Broken Bells ""Holding On for Life"". You can hear the recording imperfections of the older Redding and Beatles tracks. Bass is perfect, punch but not TKO on Jay-Z and Trentemoller. In terms of bass vs. treble, I think the bass is just right but on Hard Knock Life the treble seems a bit too accentuated. Makes me wonder what Jay-Z and Co. were listening to in the studio, or what type of speakers they intended the track to be played on. Anyway, these baby's sound great IMO.

The cable! This was a major weakness on the E4c and has been significantly upgraded for the SE425. The cable is now thinner and more pliable, making it far less cumbersome that the previous model. Also, the 3.5mm jack is recessed so it works with the original iPhone (2G). I know, a bit old school but still, considerate for those of us stuck in 2007. BTW, they also improved the y-connection (lighter) and the slider to tighten the cable under your chin. Good job Shure engineers!

Color - I opted for the clear. Accidentally, actually. Anyway, I couldn't be happier! The cord is slivery and really cool looking, and I think the clear plastic on the earpieces makes them a little more subtle. Can't comment on the black ones.

As for the overall benefits of these vs. say an over-the-ear style... These are extremely small and portable. They also do a great job of blocking other sounds - basically earplugs. That can be unnerving if you're walking down the street with these in. It also means you can ""hear"" vibrations such as the cable rubbing on your zipper, your own footsteps, or if you're chewing food. Another plus is that they don't leak sound so you can crank them up and not bother the person sitting next to you.

Regarding comfort, I think they take a little getting used to. The black foam tips work really well for me, but my ears get ""tired"" after an hour or so. Tough call here since I think you need to try them for a while to know if it works for you, but to do that you need to buy them first...

Happy researching and I hope you find a pair you like as much I like my new SE425s! :D"
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds

I would describe these as very accurate. They don't emphasize the highs or lows...they give you a very accurate representation of the music you're listening to. If like the emphasized bass of many earbuds you will not like these. HOWEVER...if you listen to music that has actual low frequency content it will be heard just not over emphasized.

Like many earbuds, these benefit from a good seal. There is a good variety of included ear tips, take the time and find the one that gives you the best seal, it's worth the time and effort.

The build quality of these is very nice and It's awesome to have a replaceable cord...that's been the primary reason I've had to purchase new head phone...the cord always dies.

So far after one month of use, I have no complaints at all.

*** UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW ***

After about 3 months with these one of the earbuds broke.

The tip of the right earbud broke when inserting it into my ear. In looking at the broken piece it's a pretty fragile piece. I didn't see any issues like mine in scanning the reviews, so I was more than a little shocked when it happened.

Needless to say this changes my opinion of the product drastically. These are pretty expensive and now I'm looking at a new pair."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Shure SE420’s stopped working last month. Not so much a catastrophe as a whimper, as the left ear bud volume got dimmer and dimmer I tried everything to fix them. Well, sadly, these guys went back to Shure. And it was not as traumatic as expected. I bought and reviewed these guys back in August 2007. I wore them almost daily. Long useful life. Digging out my backup Shure E3’s (slightly shrill high end, but still great compared to the preferred SE420), I packed up my SE420’s under Shure’s repair and/or replacement policy. I expected and allowed them to replace the SE420’s with the updated SE425 at a reduced cost vs. new. Service provided quick turnaround, along with emails along the way to show status. (Thanks Shure).

Upon receipt, so much was familiar. The plastic bubble box contained the earphones, a package with a variety of earplug styles and sizes, and an instruction manual. I removed the foam earplug installed on the earphone, struggling to not damage the underlying structure upon which it sits. Age and use broke one of these posts on a prior pair of earphones so I am sensitive to this potential weak spot. Under the removed earplug was the plastic post, undamaged, but also untested in regards to any “new” strength it may have gained over prior generations. Having tried a variety of earplugs in the past, I knew what I preferred for ease of use, good seal, and comfort for my own ear. Most users should be able to settle on a suitable plug for their own use.

The differences among the E3, SE420, and the SE425 is the configuration of the earphone sitting much closer to the surface of your ear and head, the removable and twistable connection post to the cable, the stiffer cable into the connection post allowing a harder but flexible loop over the back and top of the ear, and the way insertion occurs.

For many users of prior earbuds some of these issues may present difficulties. These SE425’s are similar to the more professional models that musicians wear sitting against and inside the folds of the ear. This means that there is only one way to wear them—over the top of the ear, with the cable wrapped around and “molded” to the back of the ear. The insertion can be confusing with no marking to indicate L(eft) or R(ight) on each piece, but it quickly becomes easier once you realize that the whole assembly twists providing a way to wrap and warp the whole thing into the proper position. I cannot say I like this better than prior designs, but I am getting used to it, and the way the earphone sits in your ear is very ergonomic and flat against your head. With wires and phones and buds almost flat against your head, someone could fall asleep in these with no problem. The stiffer upper cable is appreciated, as it helps set the position in your ear, helps hold the earphones in place, and also helps the user figure out which bud goes into what ear over repeated removals and reinsertions.

The durability of this new configuration will bear out with usage. On one hand the stiffer cord should mean less wear, but the twisting connection might not hold over time. There is no perceived static during listening and rotating your head that causes some twist in the connection—so far so good over a couple of weeks of listening.

As for sound, these SE425’s provide the expected well balanced sound I preferred in the SE420’s. Listening on both the computer using a Firefly decoder and an ipod with 320 kps MP3 files, all expectations were met. Bass is balanced and for earphones, strong enough to be noticeable but not as (obviously and potentially) ear shattering as one might experience from headphones or speakers. The SE425’s shine in the seamless transition from mid range to higher end frequencies. A rich and even warm middle makes vocals and the majority of instrumentation that falls into these frequencies very pleasant. The higher frequencies are not shrill or over done. A cymbal sounds like a cymbal not hiss.

Dependent on recording engineering, there is no muddiness in the sound for rock, symphonic, noisy independent rock, and electronic ambient music. Sound stage placement and sound field is wide and well within the parameters expected for this mode of listening. Over the past weeks of listening on drives to work, the sound isolation is very good. While these earphones do not have any active noise reduction, most users should be able to find a suitable fit to knock down a majority of the external noise, maybe even as this user has observed, making these earphones a potential replacement for active noise reduction that many prefer for air travel.

There is no doubt that if you are considering earphones you recognize that higher end ear phones can effectively compete with headphones (both less and more expensive), providing a balanced and great sound over many different music types, portability, ease of storage, along with a less visible alternative. The SE425, like its siblings, can provide most users a satisfying listening experience and come recommended for the price point."
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great iem's. The mid range frequencies are highlighted nicely. The highs and lows are pretty neutral imho. Making them perfect for musicians who are looking for honest interpretations of live performances. I'm a drummer and that's what I use them for. However if you are looking for just a great set of in ears that sweeten and hype the sound skip these and look into others. These are more honest than that but still sound crystal clear and quite nice still. Flat low end response, so if you like a lot of bass in your mix steer clear of these. They are comfortable and isolate sound very well."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, before beginning, I have a few disclosures regarding this review: Even though I will focus my review on the sound I am not an audiophile. I would describe myself as an audio enthusiast more than audiophile. This review is based on music ripped to MP3 format, no lower than 256kbps (most of my music is on 320kbps). In addition, my music players are mainly my Samsung Ativ Book 9 (NP900X3E-K01US) and the mobile phone HTC One M8 (Google Play Edition, rooted, no EQ, BoomSound OFF!!!! and low power audio profile disabled)... Finally, I mainly listen to Rock/Heavy Metal, Jazz, and Latin music (SALSA) genres. Hopefully these details will give you a better perspective about my review:
I have used several earphones over my life. Among my favorites are: Altec Lansing UHP306 (loved these with passion!) and UHP326 (nice ones too), Sennheiser CX 300 II (sounded as ""V"" shaped curve), Shure SE215LTD (I still have these). After getting frustrated about getting my cables messed up with time and having to replace/buy new headphones I came along the Shure SE215LTD which offers a replaceable cable. For me, it was the deal maker and as soon I had the opportunity, I got them for a fair price. At first, compared to the Sennheiser CX 300 II, I did not like them that much. The CX 300 II are way brighter and louder than the Shure SE215LTD. At the moment I was still using my old Samsung Galaxy Nexus with an audio mod (Viper4Android if you're curious about it). After giving the SE215LTD a chance and tweaking the EQ on my Galaxy Nexus, I actually got a sweet sound out of them... and with time I started liking them more than Sennheiser's. They have a more mid-centric sound with a strong bass response but lacked a little bit of clarity (musical instrument resolution was somewhat absent). I upgraded my phone to the HTC One M8 and the sound got a lot better. The Shure SE215LTD came to a different level of sound. But still, they lacked crispness to my taste! Then, I decided to jump my price limit of less than $100 and get something different. I bought the Shure SE425-V and WOW!
Compared to other headphones, and specially the SE215LTD, the SE425 are very balanced. The highs these reproduce are great. About the low freq. response, I frankly do not understand some complains about low to no bass reproduction on other reviews. The bass is really tight and properly balanced. In fact, what I love about these headphones is precisely the bass. It is not exaggerated and does not distract you from other sounds! Everything is there and you can actually tell! The mids are awesome; vocals sound like somebody is singing in your ears! Guitars, drums, bass, vocals... everything is there as long as the mix (the music track) is properly done. Unfortunately, some mixes exaggerate some instruments more than others... These headphones will give you a more realistic sound, if the bass was not properly mixed in the tracks of the album (I am talking to you Metallica - ...And Justice for All) you will not hear it as clear as others (Bruce Dickinson - Accident of Birth). With these headphones you will be able to listen new sounds (more details) that you might have not listened before. I do not listen to HIP-HOP/RAP but these headphones make me like this genres; the bass is really tight and the highs sound absolutely awesome. The same is true for R&B/Soul. The music gets full of details but not overwhelming on any frequency!
Having said that, if you are a bass head you might not like these (perhaps the Shure SE215 may be a good fit..?!). Again, these headphones can be better described as neutral/flat. The better the quality of your audio source and the mix of the track, the better sound you'll get from these. With the 425 I do not have to rely on EQ’s anymore. Compared to other earphones I have had, I can say that the Shure 425 are far more superior in every aspect of audio. Quality wise, I cannot complain (replaceable cable, two years warranty, built strong enough to hold everyday usage, including gym!). The difficult part is the price… and frankly, they are worth every penny, especially for audiophile and enthusiasts (like me). However, if you do not want/cannot spend $300 on earphones, I would say there are plenty of great options under $100. I would say that the Sennheiser CX 300 II are a great option for their price (cheap and nice sound!). If you want a little bit more value for your money, the Shure SE215LTD (or the regular SE215) will give you a lot more (replaceable cable is a huge plus for me). Regarding the comfort, the SE425 are comfortable enough to wear them long hours (up to 3 hours) without problems; even when working out I do not have any problems. Even though the SE215LTD and the SE425 share similar design, I feel the latter is more comfortable.
On a side note, I had the opportunity to try for a couple of minutes another dual driver earphones, the Westone W20. Compared to the Shure425, the W20 are may be a little bit brighter. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to properly compare these two. I just wanted to mention it since my initial impressions were really positive; it might be wise to check these too if you are looking to break your wallet for earphones ;)
I will try to keep this review updated if I can get other earphones and compare them with these. If you have some specific questions I will be happy to answer them as soon as I can; I understand that buying new earphones can be really hard and difficult!"
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a few things for the potential buyer.

I have used every Shure SE model from the 215s to the 535s (I haven't found a need for the 846s yet), so take my review only as a comparison to other similar level Shure models.

425's are nice. I use them every day for my daily routine. I keep a pair of 535s at home for use on my computer. I do not consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound. That's what you'll get with Shure.

If you are new to higher-end in ear models, you might want to take a look at a step down from the SE425's to the SE315's. They have similar performance, although I do think the lows are quite clearer and the highs aren't as overpowering in the 425's. If you have the extra cash, take a leap and get the 425's. They are great for everyday use. You won't hear what's going on around you, so just make sure you are aware and don't get hit by a train. That's how powerful the isolation is on these models. You end up listening to your music much quieter, which could help preserver your hearing down the line.

Ok, let's do pros and cons of the SE425 (from my perspective):

Pros: Sound, durability, comfort, sound isolation

Cons: color (my preference), ease of first time use (it takes a few times to learn how to put them on), price (I'm reaching for this one, good value, and it depends on where you buy it from)

Other thoughts: Learning how to put them on isn't actually that hard, but it seems awkward at first. Find the left and right buds, squeeze the foam, and stick it in your ear so that the earpiece is inside your ear. The cord goes over and behind your ear, and the foam expands to seal your ear canal. If you don't get the seal right, you lose a huge amount of the performance of these buds. Then I run the cord down my back through my shirt and into my pocket. The buds have never fallen out, and the cord is protected so you can't get snagged and have them ripped out of your ear."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth set of Shure buds over the decades and after 18 months of use, I remain well pleased. Unlike earlier designs, the cables seem to be good quality and haven't shorted out on their own. No static at the connections to the buds and I find the added swivel increases ear comfort and noise isolation. Reinforced cable ends fit comfortably behind my ears so I can jog without dislodging them. To my ears, the 500 series with triple drivers have even better sound, but only incrementally better so I wasn't willing to pay the extra $100.

As with all canal phones, you must find the size & shape of flanges to make a good seal to create the bass notes. Sound is very flat and pure with a nice good balance of highs, mids, and lows.

Like others, I cracked the plastic sound tube on one side the first day removing the shipping flanges that were fused to the material. From hindsight, it may be best to carefully slice off the rubber rather than twisting. This is one of the maddening design flaws that Shure is prone to keep repeating. But, their warranty service is excellent so this isn't a major concern. It would be nice if the cable ends were color coded as the molded ""R"" & ""L"" are hard to see.

For the price, it's disappointing that the phone control cables are not included. If they were, I'd rate these as 4.6 phones."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE425 earbuds I am reviewing may be an older model. Mine are clear with a clear cable, and it has the easily-unplugged modular cable.

I have used several earbuds over the years. it's less that i'm fickle about the sound and more that i tend to damage or lose them. i have used Klipsch s4i, monster turbine, powerbeats (the wired version), bose, sennheiser ie4, etymotic hf5, and shure 200 earbuds, as well folding bose and sennheiser on-ear headphones.

Sound Quality: excellent, unless heavy bass suits your listening habits and unless you primarily use them for working out. Public Image Limited's ""Albatross,"" a bass-heavy tune from Metal Box, has very sharp, well-defined highs and lows. So does Charles Mingus's 'Haitian Fight Song"" the balance between horns, piano and bass is outstanding. in the bass-treble comparison, these are about neutral for me, equally weighted as opposed to leaning toward the high or low. The accuracy of these earbuds is better than pretty much anything else i have tried. there are better choices if you prefer a very strong bass response - the old Monster Turbines are outstanding for that, as are the Powerbeats. One cost of this kind of sound precision is that moving the cable around, if you're wearing earbuds and on the go, creates a bit of rustling noise. short of very actively working out, running for example, it's not that noticeable.

Build quality: extremely solid. the buds themselves are substantial, though they have a plastic housing. The clear cable is robust, so is the stereo plug. the cable has a bendable wire near the ear, no doubt made so you wear the cable over the ear. the cables can easily unplug from each earbud, a real plus if you tend to wreck your cabling. On the downside, wearing these earbuds while working out and sweating can create substantial interference if sweat invades the plug-in connection between the cable and the earbud. it's enough of an issue that i don't use these for long walks or runs.

fit: once you find the right ear tip, they fit really well. Shure provides these with a variety of earplugs, so most people should be able to find a solution that works. I prefer the triple-flange poly tips. getting these inserted into your ear canal and situated on your ear takes a little bit of work. But, once inserted, they feel very comfortable, keep most outside noise out, and don't jostle around because the earbud fits so well in the contour of my ear. i like the bendable wire for where the cable loops over my ear.

Cost: on the higher end of the kinds of earbuds most consumers will pay for, I think, at $299 retail. (I would never spend a thousand bucks on earbuds, but there are a number of them available for that and more....and i'll bet they sound awesome). I found mine used for testing purposes for well less than that. Worth it? absolutely. These are the earbuds I reach for on any work trip or in any situation where I want headphones and happen to be sitting around or walking around and want to listen to music. Basically, for any situation where i'm not working out."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned a pair for a year and three times the stem which holds the foam tip has sheared off, each time without me noticing them undergoing any abnormal stress. I’ll pull them out of my pocket and it’s just gone. At this point I’m not willing to pay to fix them again. I no longer have any faith in this product. I’d be willing to take some share of the blame, except I have owned 3 different pairs of Shure SE215s (and their predecessor) over the last decade and have never had this issue. I went from loving Shure products to no longer trusting them. I don’t know if it’s an issue with design or material, but it’s really ridiculous."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are by far the best earphones I've ever owned or worn. The sound reproduction is simply stunning. I was particularly impressed by the amazing depth and richness of the bass response. It's definitely a constant source of 'WOW' to hear such crystal clear, non-distorted thumping bass coming out of such a tiny little package! I have, like many other audiophiles I suppose, been under the misconception that, where bass sound reproduction is concerned at least, bigger is better. You know, that a15"" woofer just HAS to be better than a 12"" woofer, which in turn must be an order of magnitude better than a 10"" woofer, and an 8"" woofer, and so on. Well, these tiny little ear phones have certainly dispelled and shattered that notion for me! Shure has built these puppies with separate speakers and channels for bass and midrange/highs. How they managed to actually jam and cram 2 different speakers into such a tiny space is completely beyond me, but one listen to these earphones will absolutely blow you away, and you too will become a believer and most likely an evangelist. Expensive? Well, that depends... They are certainly more than your average $20-$30 sony earbuds that you can get at 711, for sure. But honestly, these earphones aren't even in the same league with those typical ' value' buds. They are totally pro quality, no compromise products that represent the state of the art. And you definitely CAN and WILL hear the difference, its obvious. So, great value for money, in my opinion. And extremely comfortable, in every way. I've worn them for 5-6 hours at a time on overseas flights with no pain or soreness whatsoever. And what's better yet, they're noise canceling, so they are perfect for plane flights and blocking out all of that annoying and loud jet noise, not to mention the screaming baby noise etc. I've worn these on flights with no music playing thru them just to sleep better, and they do the job beautifully. And so much better and less obtrusive than having to strap on those huge over-ear Bose headphones that you see people wearing and having to haul around with them... If you're an audiophile or just picky about hearing your music sound as good as it can be, I'd highly recommend these earphones."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought mine at a local retailer that has a price match guarantee. That was over six months ago. I waited enough time for them to break-in properly, and also to make up my mind as I went back and forth on what I think about these ear buds. After all they are not inexpensive and similar sound can be had for much less. In the end, I give these Shure SE425 four stars. Here's why:

Fit - It is not easy to get the proper fit. Over the ear cords may not be for everyone and to get proper bass response, these need to be fit carefully and deeply into the ear. When they are properly in place they sound awesome. But when they slide even a bit out of the ear, the bass falls off fast and the balance becomes pretty bad. I've tried different rubber tips and still struggle with the fit but can get it right most of the time now.

Sound - I've read all the reviews here and it is easy for someone thinking about these to be confused. Some people state these are the best ear buds they've ever heard, others say they are horrible. My background is in music and my home audio system is very high-end. I can talk in terms of ""Bloom"" ""Micro-dynamics"" ""Sound-stage"" and ""Tonality"" as these are terms audiophiles often use to describe high-end systems. It took me a few hundred hours of use for the sound to settle in properly and during that period I questioned the sound quality. After six months of use I can now say these come fairly close to what a home high-end system can do....most of the time. I feel at times that there is a slight overemphasis of the mid-range which others have pointed out. I fixed that by using the Jazz EQ setting on my iPod Classic which raises the high and low end a bit over the mid-range. But I also feel that with proper fit, the tone quality is exceptional. Overall they are very neutral. For those who like things bass heavy, you may be disappointed. But if you are looking for true reproduction of the sound as it was originally recorded, these do great from rock to classical.

Quality - Here is where I can say you get what you pay for. Is it worth it to buy a $80 set of ear buds that will break in a year? That has happened to me all too often. From the quality of the replaceable cord, to the two-year warranty, it seems to me these can last several years. Thus the overall cost of ownership seems to make these a good value.

Should you buy? This is the bottom line. If you value the quality of the sound over ease of use and price, I would say with no hesitation that these are great ear buds. If you are concerned about the over-the-ear fit and also the price then you probably want to look somewhere else. Remember though, that these should last much longer than most of the sub $100 ear buds on the market today."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having an active lifestyle and good ear for music is not necessarily a favorable combination when searching for in-ear headphones. Over the past several years, I've spent anywhere from $60-$200 on in ear headphones that never lasted me more than a few months. Furthermore, I found that either the bass was too heavy, the highs were too high, or you couldn't hear the lows. Basically, the sound was never balanced.

These headphones are extremely balanced. Those complaining about the lack of bass clearly didn't read the instructions. It's all about the fit. If you fit the headphones correctly, the bass is perfect, might even be much when listening to the more bass heavy... not to say that it overpowers in any way. These are the clearest, most well-balanced headphones out there. I've had the Monster Turbines, the Bowers and Wilkins, the Beats, and the Klipsich. I never got the bose ones because the cord was too delicate and would likely break after a short period of time.

Many of the headphones I listed about had problems with the cord anywhere from a week to 3 months into owning them. This is what happens when you use headphones for snowboarding, hiking, the gym, and other active hobbies. The major plus about the Shure's are that the cord is detachable and replaceable. Although this is the sturdiest cord I have ever come across, should there ever be any issues, all I would need to do is replace the cord, which saves me the $270 I spent on them.

The price is a bit hefty, but if you are a stickler about your music and an active listener, you will appreciate these. It's really annoying when I know there are certain elements of music I am not hearing or are overexagerated/understated because of faulty headphones. You will hear aspects of your favorite songs that you never knew existed with these. They are worth every penny.

One negative, they can be quite overwhelming at times. They are not your typical, light, in ear headphones. The sound is powerful and so is the presence of it in your ear. You will have to get used to them. The first time I had them in for about an hour and had to take them off because I was getting slightly dizzy."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Frankly, I miss the low ends with this earphones and don't really enjoy listening to music with them. Also it isn't so comfortable for long periods of time - but I guess it depends on your ear shape/size. Luckily, I can use it at a different angle (see photo) which works much better for me and still seals quite well / sounds the same. Another issue is the cable. It is bulky and one would think they make them tougher - it doesn't. It constantly gets in the way and I had to replace one after 4-5 months (luckily through the warranty - which is a plus I guess. They responded quite fast). The second one showed signs of cracking after about the same period of time and eventually the plastic wrap started to come of in pieces. I liked the idea of being able to change the cable with a spare one - that's basically why I thought it is worth spending the money for a good pair of earphones. If you also think the same, check the price of the spare cable first. I used the ones with built-in iphone controller and they are surprisingly expensive. Anyway, it's still a decent set of headphones, if you have more money then sense."
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these primarily to use when playing guitar at church as an in-ear monitor. For this purpose, I couldn't be happier. These are a huge step up from the Westone UM1's I've used in the past. I also like the fact that the cable is replaceable as this is usually the first thing to fail. I'd rather spend around $40 to replace the cable instead of $300 to replace the set.

I will say that the sound with my iPod is very good. Great clarity in the mid-range and upper frequencies, but not as punchy in the bass as I would like. I've owned several sets of in-ear headphones and know the value of a proper fit in the ear canal (this is not the problem). I suspect that drivers in the Shure SE425s require a bit more power than my iPod can dish out.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the SE 425s.

Update - Feb 24, 2012: After using these for a few weeks they have definitely opened up. The bass is much better when playing through my iPod/iPhone. I'm very happy with these!"
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has definitely outdone themselves with this wonderful product. Never have I experienced more clarity in a pair of IEMs. For someone who listens to alternative rock, pop, and an assorted array of indie music, I say that few IEMs can do better. The amount of detail displayed is extraordinary. Vocals are crystal clear and forward, especially female vocals. However, the bass is lacking a bit in quantity, but they're by no means flat. It's still punchy enough to satisfy most listeners. No, these IEMs are not for bass-heads, but for those who want precision. If you're someone who prefer to have lows that accentuate exceptional mids and highs, these are the headphones for you. They're the quintessential headphone for the intimate listener."
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These in ears just don't sound good. Simply put, and coming from someone to whom I tried to sell them as well. I don't know if my pair was a dud, but the mids are recessed and the overall tone is just not appealing.
They isolate fine and work for drumming, but I wouldn't use them for studio monitoring or for just listening to music."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned both the SE110 and SE425 earphones over the past 5 years and I can't say enough good things about them. The first time I put in the SE425s I heard things in my music that I never thought I could hear! Very rich and clear sound. Seriously, listen to The Dark Knight soundtrack on these and just feel a grin spread from ear to ear. :) They have held up very well to daily use in the office and during runs. I use the medium foam sleeves, which are extremely comfortable to use all day and block out ambient sound as advertised. Now if only Shure would include a sign to put up at my desk that I'm listening to music so people wouldn't walk up behind me and scare the crap out of me while I have them in..."

Despite my persistence, to him, it seemed par for the course for them to have failed so much. I am flabbergasted at the negligence of this company. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THESE.

5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh wow!!! A little bit of me regrets buying these headphones, since now I will no longer be able to go back to any headphones under $200 or anything that doesn't offer the sound quality offered with the Shure SE425. As a long time Shure user (E2C, I2C+m, SE115+m and SE215), I'm well that Shure makes quality products, but have never bought anything over $125.00. So stepping up to the SE425, is actually a big jump and I was hesitate to believe that there would be that much of a difference. But since I'm a heavy business traveler and prefer noise isolating over noise canceling headphones, I decided to treat myself to a premium set of headphones and decided on the SE425. And now...WOW!!! I'm now hearing things in songs that I never heard using other headphones. Separation is the musical instruments and vocals that are so crisp and clear. What a great set of headphones...well worth the price if you're a music lover."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just replaced a pair of (much-loved) westone earbuds. have had these for less than an hour (so no 'burn-in' yet), but, out of the box, they sound great. tight, deep bass (and not exaggerated), clean, clear, crisp. a little bright perhaps, but will see how it all sounds after i run them a while. seem to have more 'air' than the westones; nice.

well worth the investment, i needed earbuds for pro audio work (when i'm not in monitors), and am already happy with these...."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these earphones are a great bang for their buck. I found them for $225 and you couldn't ask for anything better. They hit the highs with perfect tone and have excellent isolation of the instruments. Being a drummer, the drums are usually faded in the background, but with the SE425's I can actually head every drum being hit, the different volumes and still pay attention to the other aspects of the song. 5/5 in my book. I would like to see how these stack up to the 535's, but for the cost you can't go wrong."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't decide between the 315's and the 425's, mainly because I wasn't sure the 425s could actually be worth $100 more. The only difference between the two models are 1-sound quality, 2-adaptor and 3-carrying case. The case thing is easy, because who cares what case it is? The 425s have a hard case, the 315s have a soft case. The soft case is actually a little cooler, but the hard case is probably more useful in protecting the buds. I'm not one to use a case unless I'm traveling or such anyway. The 425s come with the adapter for standard headphone jacks. If you really need one you likely already have it, and since they only cost a couple of bucks to buy, I don't think that should count in the comparison. So that leaves us with sound quality. Ok, funny story: When I first tried out the 425s my husband came by and asked why I had that awful look on my face. I was so disappointed! They were tinny and made the music sound cold and dead. I took them out, very disappointed, and tried the 315s, which sounded a bit warmer. When I put the 425s back in a few minutes later I realized that if my fingers were on them, they sounded amazing. Well, a bit of fiddling with the different sleeves and I found a set that fit my ear well. These aren't slam-in-your-ear-and-go earbuds. It takes a moment to get them on and adjusted (tho I can see that getting easier with practice) but when you do - WOW. Here is my best tip: Get them in the way you think they are supposed to go, then push on the housing and see if they sound better. If so, you're not getting a good fit and you should try a different sleeve or re-seat them. The foam versions of the sleeves can be rather hard to get on and off, but it is worth it.

So, which ones did I keep? The 425s. Yeah, there really is $100 difference in the sound. Now, everyone is different, and I'm using these as iPod/computer earbuds, not for reference or monitoring, but for me the detail produced by the 425s is excellent.

I've been through a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years. I have returned more pairs of earbuds than I care to admit in the $100 range, too. These 425s are better than any earbuds I've ever tried (tho NOT more comfortable, at least not yet). The 425s are actually better than my very expensive Sony over-ear, full size headphones, too.

I like the cord design. I was concerned about the detachable cord, given some of the other reviews here, but I hear no static so maybe they've fixed that issue.

And as for sound-isolation. I don't feel like I'm deaf to the world with them on, but I certainly can't hear a lot of external noise. For example, I'm sitting in a room 10 feet from a TV on which there is a loud football game playing. With the music on I cannot hear the game at all. If I turn the music off, I can hear the TV. It's pretty much the same effect as having a pair of the sort of foam earplugs ya wear to a concert on, so, ya know, set your phone to vibrate.

I'm very satisfied with them Day 1 (this is all not having burned them in yet). The 315s are on their way back."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the very steep price tag plus the track record and history of a known brand, the sound on these earphones was horrendous. My other $20 set was literally way better. Then I tried the Apple ones and some others and there was no comparison. I don't know what Shure messed up with these but the sound wasn't clear, virtually no bass."
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"BUYER BEWARE
The sound quality is good but my eartip broke while in its case very easily, and when I contacted customer service, they suggested a minimum $70 per ear charge for this. Pls see photo and decide for yourself."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am currently using these earphones installed custom silicon sleeves custom made by Sensaphonics. For the record the earphones come with lots of tips (much better than my IE7 which are horrible). To me, these things are too bassy. Other words to describe the sound is rich, or colored. They don't have a flat studio monitor sound that I was expecting. Also the treble leaves much to be desired. Either the low end obscures the treble, or the treble is just not strong enough. For example the chicks and crashes of a cymbal are not reproduced very well. I have reduced the bass by using the equalizer in my ipod and it made the sound more acceptable to me.

The cord that comes with it are top notch. The cables are braided and extra long. I like how it has the ear wrap around built into the cord (unlike my IE7). The one strange thing is the cables can be disconnected at the earpiece and because of this when they aren't installed the ear piece is free to spin around so it takes a while to figure out the position you need to put them in before sticking them in you ear. This issue is probably more pronounced since I am using the custom sleeves, but I am getting better at installing them over time. I think I prefer the sound of my IE7 over these, but since the IE7 have such a poor fit I will probably be using the 425 more often."

3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have not heard any of the higher end Shure models I can promise you are missing out. In the age of ""beats"" and emphasis on bass heavy `phones, Shure remains an underrated secret formally only known by the pros. In fact, long ago shure sold only to the professional market, but once portable listening devices started to become prominent the company realized that there was a growing number of people that bought their sets and took them outside the studio. Keep in mind that no product bearing the Shure name is going to do anything besides try to reproduce your music as faithfully as possible (read: no more bass than the guy who mastered the music heard)

There is a great review on here that describes many of the characteristics of these models that incorporate the ""MicroDriver"" technology. To sum what was said there,

Obviously these have the ability to make all the noise in the 20-20k range that you can hear, while this is important and not all earphones can do it, it is a given that these can. That is just boring specs, and doesn't mean much at this price point unless you just like graphs.

There are a few things you will notice between a pair of $100 in ear ""beats"" or equivalent. You will find that your music has a sort of ""space"" in it. That is to say that different sounds almost sound like they have their own earphone, as if there is one tiny speaker for each sound inside the bud. This is alone a spectacular feat and is extremely difficult to achieve in sound reproduction because of the mass of the speaker itself and the fact that one or a few speaker elements have to make the sounds at the same time where as live there are different things making their own noise completely independent of each other. This is a unique phenomenon that most people will never hear due to the expense but it is the single most important thing to make music sound real.

Also, the signature Shure sound is such that no one sound overpowers another, which is another difficult trick. I have not heard a sound reproduction device of any kind or at any cost that does it better than the Shure SE 530. 99% of the earphones on the market lie about what they are capable of, and by that I mean they are bass heavy to make them sound like they have good low frequency characteristics but this causes an unclear sound and an overpowering feeling that drowns out detail in your music. This is the gimmick that Bose made famous in the past 15 years.

Finally, and most importantly is the most difficult trick of them all. It is very difficult to make a speaker that can move fast enough to give you a dynamic and realistic high definition sound. For example, a note plucked on a bass will first incorporate a transient pluck sound which momentarily accompanies the actual noise of the string vibrating. This is very difficult for a speaker because it must first deliver the first noise but quickly and transparently stop making that noise while still making the actual note as the instrument does. This is also very well demonstrated by a piano. Try it out on what you're listening to music on, and if it's not a Shure earphone that starts with 4 or 5 then these can do it better.

On those three points, the Shure SE 530 may just be the best sounding thing you have ever heard next to a live performance, and the 425 is a close second with a strong family resemblance. The difference is, quite simply, everything the 425s do so well the 530s do just a bit better. I have not yet heard the 535 model but some that have claim it has lost the balanced sound of the 530 and now the 425 is the best in the lineup."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Obtained these as a replacement for my beloved e3c's. Sound quality is overall very good. Very clear mid's and high's. The bass is a bit thin compared to the e3c. Build quality is excellent. I love the idea of a detachable cord, which would make replacement a snap. I am a bit surprised a volume control is not included in 2014, and I take issue with the $50 cost of a replacement cord to add this functionality.

I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could, but because it's SHURE, I'm rounding up."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have used Shure earbuds for years. My previous pair of scl4's broke and I sent them back to Shure, who offered me a huge discount to get this model, so I did so. Well, the 425 has the advantage of great sound, but it takes a LONG time to put them in place each and every time I use them. It is a real pain to do so, since it becomes a project instead of 'plug in and play'. Given that I've used earbuds for a decade or so, I am having a hard time getting used to how long it takes to orient these suckers.... Also, the best ""seal"" for me is with the triple flange, but that provides the worst sound isolation. Nonetheless, the sound quality (not the isolation) is terrific. I also like that the buds don't stick out past my ear, so I can put my head sideways on a pillow and listen without feeling pressure from the earbud. So bottom line: some real pluses, but also some real minuses... a bit disappointing b/c Shure usually has only positives, imo."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been blessed (or cursed) with ears that detect subtle differences in audio quality, so I have always considered the higher-end Shure Earphones to be the cream of the crop, vs. Sennheiser and other ""solid"" providers. My beef with Shure earphones has been over durability, as I have replaced three pair due to frayed connectors. Hopefully the newer ""modular"" style from Shure will be more durable and at least will be less expensive to repair (all of the older SE's were one piece construction).

I own an older pair of E4's, a pair of 535's, and recently purchased the SE 425-V. I use the E4's for working out/running and the 535's for travel and personal listening. I also have a set of Grado PS1000 Professional Headphones for sound editing and mixing. (Shure also sells headphones now - but they are garbage. It's simply a rebranded headphone stamped with the Shure name and sold at a price point to complete with the even trashier Bose headphone line. It's sad to see Shure tarnishing its rich pro-audio history by trying to be a ""me too"" in the headphone market).

I've performed a side by side comparison of the old E4's, the SE 535's, and the new SE-425-V. Using the same equipment and file formats (AU-PCM, FLAC, & MP3). Performance of all 3 was fairly relative across the various formats. (AU-PCM provides the truest reproduction). The SE-425-V is inferior to the old E4's IMO. Highs are a bit grainy at low volumes and turn grungy at louder volumes. In the mids (btw 2-6kHz), the SE425 sound is hollow. They perform a bit better in the low ranges with a warm and sturdy sound, but still sounds a bit thicker at lower volumes than the E4's.

My order of preference are the 535's (although I still favor the old E5's), the E4's, and lastly the SE-425V. The story seems to be that Shure is addressing the durability issue, but I am beginning to wonder if the company is lowering its standards in the development and production of micro drivers in the earphones. The newer versions may test out technically sound, but the test is in the perception of the human ear.

As a long-time user of Shure pro-audio equipment, I have to say I am disappointed in the direction of the earphone line, and in the future will open up my ears to other options out there. The SE425-V is solid, but not at the Shure price point."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as a replacement for some SCL4's that were broken. A few things I noticed right away: the cable and the earphones feel really solid. I don't see this falling apart anytime soon. It seems like most of the price went into the construction. I prefer the white triple flange sleeves so immediately put those on and as usual, got a great comfortable fit. The design of these earphones keeps them from sticking out too far which I like and I felt like these would stay in my ears until I wanted to remove them rather than them falling out as I've experienced with other brands of earphones. However, my gripe with these is the sound. The midrange is just too far forward. It's not that these are incapable of producing clear highs or solid tight lows, it's just that the midrange seems to overpower everything else to the point that they can end up sounding nasal. I tried a few songs and then switched these out for my ultimate ears triple fi 10's and I found that they are the exact opposite of each other. I think the fit on the UE's is terrible which is why I got these but the sound is clear and powerful while the midrange honk on the 425's makes me wonder how these can cost as much as they do. If I could only have one set of earphones, it would not be these."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all the sound quality is no better than any standard headphones. I do not mean chinese quality random brands but let's say a 3200 philips (which is around 15 $) give the same sound with Shure SE 425. Maybe it gives better sound when you connect it to a speaker or an amplifier but with Iphone, the sound quality of Shure is limited.

Secondly - and more importantly - trying to put these on your ears is a s*** experience and yes each time it is like that. You need to spend 15 minutes shaping the cables for your ear. Sticking the headphones down to your ear is like making a surgical operation. It is not easy to use these headphones. Shaping the cables, putting them out and putting them properly back in is a certain hassle. After you put them on you pray that you will not see on the street someone you know so that you wont need to get them off again. If you want to have blood polyps in your ass or if you have an anger management problem then Shure 425 is the product you are looking for. It takes ages for a proper sound.

If you like big headphones try DNA Monster - fantastic sound. If you want something smaller try Logitech which is around the same price. BUT Shure 425 for an iphone is not a good headphone. The sound is standard and the usability is perfectly crap."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"TL/DR: For trust fund hippies only. Returning these because of the awkward fitting process due to the curved wire that's require to curve around your ear for proper fit each and every time, blindly. I just wanted simple but high quality ear phones. I'm not in an indie rock band as their website would like me to be... When I HAVE to look in a mirror just to fit these silly ear phones to fit right, I know I've made a poor purchase decision and have to return these asap. The real issue is that the pliable wire that is supposed to curve around your outer ear swivels during removal and proper storage between use. So it's near impossible for me to easily insert these at the next use without looking in a mirror since the wire curve angle and positioning has since changed after carefully loosely winding them in their handy storage case. For man-bun drummers, only I suppose. I'll keep searching for something that works easily and simply for me. Other than that, these are of high quality throughout..not enough resonant bass response for my taste, too. And yes, I do listen to college radio rock using an iPhone 6s. I just can't deal with mounting these in under 2 mins each time, or without a mirror to visualize proper fit.

The last Metronomy album that has an analog feeling seems stiff through this headphone.

5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Used to own Shure SCL4s. They were amazing, but the wire shredded up by the earbud after a few years and they stopped working. Recently bought these new SE 425s because of the removable/durable wire and it seemed like they would be a good, if not better, follow-up to the SCL4s. After giving them a week, I returned the 425s because they crackled when I moved my head (due to detachable wire) and because the new/bigger earbud style made the music seem a little distant (I tried every earbud size). Went back a generation and ordered the SE 420s and they are amazing. I think it has less to do with the quality of the earphones and more to do with the fact that with the SE 425s, you can't press the buds into your ear as far as the old style (like the SE 420 and SCL4s). I commend Shure for adding the cool new detachable wire (even though it crackles) and trying to advance the earbud fit, but for me, the SE 420 sound is far superior to the newer SE 425s, not to mention way cheaper at $199.

QUICK AND DIRTY: Seems to me Shure focused more on adding new features and forgot to make sure the sound finds its way through all of it. Even though they are the older model, I HIGHLY recommend going for the SE 420 over the these SE 425s due to the sound quality. Plus, you'll end up with an extra $100 because of Amazon's drastic markdown on the 420s."

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these buds, but I can't stand the heavy, long, awkward cable. I feel like I am always fooling with it. I sing in a rock cover band, so I move around a LOT.

3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,For a 300 dollars earphone I was expecting a little more sturdier construction of the casing that holds the earphone mechanism. The material they use feels like a thin cheap plastic. They could have used fiberglass or metal for this price range. I felt I've wasted money on this transaction. The cable was ok and thick which I like. Disappointed!!!
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are certainly very clear, and very natural sounding.

5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these and did a sound shootout verses my Philips SHS8100 ($15). To my surprise, the sound was very similar between the two sets of earbuds. The difference between the two is these Shure 425s are built with quality and are made to be used for extended periods of time. They are much more comfortable in your ear compared to the Philips and feel much more durable. Also, should your earbuds ever break or malfunction, there is a 2 year warranty. These are quality earbuds that will last a long time and make your audio experience more enjoyable. I happy to use them, but if I had to do it again, I would probably stick with the Philips SHS8100 and save the money."

After doing a bit a research, I had selected the 425's for the sound quality and nose isolation. The excitement came to a quick end as I am already sending them in for replacement. The first time I tried to change the foam sleeve to a different size the nozzle/tube that the sleeve fits on broke. $300 earphones lasted a total of 10 minutes. The whole plastic casing appears to be very cheap and the tubes that hold the foam or plastic inserts are small and very thin. After looking at the construction I am not sure that they wouldn't break if you put them into your pocket. Not the quality I expect for $300. Very disappointed in the product."

Oh I forgot to add: I am a jeweler by trade and I looked how the Shure 425's are made under the microscope,the plastic tubes I am talking about are so thin and so easy to brake that got me thinking that this is just a metter of time when this was going to happen.In two years when whe warranty runs out you will buy a NEW pair becose I'm sure they sound good and you will not whant to step dawn to a cheaper brand.( Shure don't whant you to have the same pair forever )"
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried a number of different in-ear earphones and have been disappointed by all of them in the past. I have a difficult ear to match, big ears but a tiny ear canal. I was reluctant to spend this much money on earphones as I rarely spend this much money to achieve audiophile quality. So after going through most of the sleeve options in the fit kit I found one that, while not perfectly comfortable, provides a great sound balance.

What is particularly enjoyable is the clear sound definition and flat frequency response. Yes, I judge these to accurately reproduce source material as the artists intended. I have been able to hear things that I have never heard before in musical sources. Critics will claim that it lacks bass response, but that is most likely in comparison to earphones/headphones with substantial bass enhancement. Those products actually give me headaches and I appreciate a flatter bass response. In fact the clarity of the response and sound isolation actually allows me to turn the volume down substantially with as much or more listening enjoyment, protecting my longer-term listening pleasure."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play drums and use this as my in-ear monitor - they work wonderful. The sound is clear without be so loud as to hurt my ears. They sound great!
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I REALLY wanted to like these but I couldn't find a way to wear them that they didn't hurt, and have them still isolate surrounding sound. I tried all the different ear tips, I even watched a video on inserting these correctly, but nothing worked. The 'tree' tips worked the best as far as quieting the surrounding noise, but they hurt terribly after 5 minutes. Maybe I have odd shaped or sensitive ears, but there was no way these were going to work.

I'm hoping wearing the combination of the Bose CQ35 and foam earplugs works better. I suffer from Misophonia so I'm desperate to quiet the noise in my open office."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are just what everyone else says about them, Super accurate, Super isolating, and very comfortable. Unfortunately they lacked bass for my taste. I used to have some 200 series, and they had more thump. You can coax bass out of these 425s, but you have to play with the eq. In the end I returned them and bought some 535s for about $70 more (look around). I just received the 535s about an hour ago, and they are every bit as clear (read amazing) as the 425, but they can get slightly louder, and they aren't missing any bass. I am now super happy."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure headphones. The previous pair was the SE215, which were also great.

Part of my job involves a lot of thinking and planning, often alone, so I plug these babies into my ears for hours at a time. I've never had issues with comfort, and the sound quality is the best I've experienced thus far -- not surprising since these are the best quality headphones I've ever purchased."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at work to block out the low drone of people's lives slowly wasting away and when I'm behind my drum kit beating the hell out of various cymbals and skins. These provide excellent isolation. I find I'm not having to turn up the music or mix to monitor so loud to overcome the volume of the acoustic drums in my fairly small room. Quite a bit better than my over-the-ear Vic Firth sound isolation phones. Plus these stay put and don't get all sweaty like the over the ears.That is really why I got these.
But I also really enjoy the fairly flat response and accurate music reproduction. Easily the best set of headphones I've ever owned sound-wise. All of my previous in-ear headphones had cable failures so I'm glad that these are replaceable. These also fit really well and stay put because of the moldable over the ear cable part.
Hopefully this will be the last pair of headphones I need to buy for many years to come and I expect that will be the case."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased these to replace previous generation that I lost at DFW. I endure many long haul flights every year. I utilize the sound isolation ear buds to eliminate airplane noise and produce incredible sound detail. The new design fits inside the bowl of the ear, instead of sticking out. Thus, it is much more comfortable when laying down and sleeping on your side. I like the replaceable cords ( though has never been a problem for me with Shure). I do not like the stiff wire near the ear, but understand its function...

Bottom line why I buy these...the sound is incredible. The noise isolation and sound quality really leaves you alone with the music."

the only downside is its short life span,
after 18 months the sound fades in and out on the left and right channel.
the issue is with the connection between the detachable cable and earbud piece.

regular cleaning of the connection port helps but does not deliver a sustainable fix."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these headphones 4 stars because they really do sound great, and for the price, they better. The drawback to me was that the words ""left"" and ""right"" are so small, you can barely read them so it is hard to figure out which ear is which. They can also be a bit tough to get wrapped around your ear. This has made me, on more than one occasion, opt for an older pair of in-ear headphones simply because I didn't want to deal with dealing with these. However, they do sound great. The bass response is really terrific and overall these are very balanced and superior sounding headphones. They make listening to music on an iPod or your iPhone really enjoyable. The foam ends are also really good and help you find a snug fit. I would recommend these headphones, but just know, they can also be a bit frustrating when you are trying to put them on."

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to put in my ears. Takes a lot of work for ear buds. Kind'a regretting the purchase now that I've been using it awhile. I find myself using an older pair just because they are easier to use .The sound quality is very good.
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is minimal low end on these in ear monitors. I don't listen to rap or electronic music, so I have to adjust the eq to extreme settings to get some punch out of bass drums or other low end warmth. Doing so makes the music sound muddy. Also, I used these once for a short run and they crapped out on me. Galaxy and iPhone headphones still work after a few thousand miles. I had previously used M-audio in ear monitors for about 7 years. They covered the majority of my workouts and commutes and never skipped a beat until my toddler got ahold of them. I can't make any recommendations, but I'd try before I buy these."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned over 30 pairs of IEM's and earphones (up to the $1500 AKG K3003I), and I can honestly say that the previous generation shures (i.e. the SE420) are better than the current generation shures (i.e. the SE425).

In my opinion, Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE425 (replacement of the SE420) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE420 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality. The new version (SE425) doesn't go as much into your ear, and it doesn't fit at all with a lot of people...

Honestly, just because of the fit issues, the SE420 sounds much better than the SE425. It's kinda like windows vista when it first launched. The previous generation is better. Period."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to place on the ear and uncomfortable to wear. Bass was was a real let-down.

6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The connectors to the individual earbuds are junk! First it starts out with a little bit of static when you move your head,then the sound fully cuts in and out, and then nothing... no sound.. nada! Consider yourself lucky if they last a month. I cannot believe these made it through any sort of product testing. I loved my previous Sures but these are useless junk and customer services is non existent, I feel ripped off. Never again will I buy a Sure product!"
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I agree with others -- these have virtually no base at all. I've tried various buds to no avail.
I suspect they need to be jammed into the ear so tightly that's its uncomfortable/painful. It seems that the tighter they are jammed into the ear, the better is the base. But to have reasonable base for my ears, is impossible with these. I have a couple of top quality on-ear headphones and compared to those, these sound cheap and nasty.
Also, the cable running over the ear is cumbersome.
For the price I cannot recommend them."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They're disappointing in that they sound the same as my first pair of single drivers ten years ago, and are only 20hz-19Khz. I've progressed further into audio, and my tube amplifier produces 5hz-65Khz, and my pre-amp is 10Hz-100Khz. I've also used an Onkyo DAC-HA200 with them which helps, but I wouldn't purchase either again. High Resolution ear cans, in 2017, can be had for the same and much less. FLAC files are becoming popular (sorry Anton Newcom for taking so long) with the public, and audio can sound amazing. Again, these SE-425 are limited to <CD quality. Also,, I can't seem to keep them around my ears like I could with the softer cabled versions."

They have a mid-rangy tone which is great for guitarist. The only way I would improve these is to upgrade to the 3 drive model but that's a lot more $$$$$
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the verge of returning these and going back to my old SE215s. The bass response was terrible on the iPhone and even my FiiO X5 portable DAC. I was convinced they were defective. But then I discovered the high gain output setting on the X5. Made all the difference in the world. The SE425s require more power. Would be nice if that bit of information had been available before buying. Even with the extra power, the bass response is not overwhelming and/or distorted. It's clear and crisp with enough ""punch"" for any kind of music. At least for my taste. If you want big, boomy bass then these are not for you. I still think the SE215s are great headphones at a good price. But for me the extra cost of the SE425s is worth the money.

I'm not in the habit of writing product reviews but I noticesd several reviews complaining about the poor bass response of the SE425's and thought this review might be useful."
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned more than a few Shure in ear phones. I had a pair of E2Cs back in the day that gave me a whole new idea of audio. I upgraded to the E3C later on. When the SE models came out, I bought the SE215. In fact, I bought them three times because one pair got lost, another pair broke, and a third pair was replaced by Shure under warranty. I loved my SE215s until they were accidentally washed in my shorts. You see, I work out with these headphones as well as listen to them casually. And they've always been good for that.
Cut to Christmas this past year and my mom wanted earphones for casual listening and work outs. I bought her the SE315s and was myself satisfied with the better low range sound it had. I hadn't planned on upgrading my SE215s until they were washed and even then, I'm sure they still work (still drying out), but I love my audio and had a few gift cards to burn. Now the SE425s are in my ears and let me say, they are extraordinary.
I've listened to top end ear phones of the past. The E5c was a particular favorite of mine. And I'm sure the SE535 and SE846 are incredible listening experiences, but I am blown away. Certain songs don't work well with in ear phones. A lot of dance tunes get mixed with stereo sounds mixed poorly....you'll hear more on the right then on the left and think you're going deaf. The SE425 doesn't do much to improve on this flaw, but the sound is SO crisp that you can tell exactly what you're listening to. All my listening is done through Tidal with HiFi lossless audio for the purest streaming experience. The pure monitor sound is a great listening experience to me. Listening to Sia's ""Cheap Thrills"" on decent speakers is pretty good. On my SE215s, you can hear more of the layering and what makes the song so enjoyable. On the SE425, it's another level. It didn't change how I heard the song, but the details were more crisp. It sounded like the music was being made for my ears. Very clear, very crisp, and I imagine very accurate to what the producer wanted listeners to hear. On to a song I didn't used to like but have since been able to appreciate more, Justin Timerblake's ""Suit & Tie"". There's a lot going on in this song. I imagine the SE846 would really shine with this song because you have a lot of range happening all at the same time. In my SE215s, it gets washed out a little bit. On speakers, it's just noise. But for the first time since it came out, listening on the SE425, I can hear so much more of the song. Justin's high end range is really crisp and the layers of the background that were washed out on my augioengine speakers now twinkle in my ears. I still can't tell what exactly is happening, sounds like chimes layered on a synthesizer and a few others but the important part is I can hear what it's supposed to sound like. Having the dual drivers lets Justin do his thing on the top range and JayZ master his more tenor timbre. There's a part of me that still misses the extra space that a real subwoofer would give you, and at $300 you can definitely find a relatively decent pair of circumaurol headphones that would give you the bass...but the earphones are not starved for bass. It's there, it's just not the most prominent feature. One last note, the SE425s seem to be much louder at lower settings than my SE215s. I used to listen at 80% volume or more...but with my LG V20 with the DAC turned on, 50% volume was pure bliss.
For the average consumer, if you're working out or running or just need a pair of headphones that will drown out the airplane or train noise, the SE215s are ideal. A hundred dollars gives you sound isolation second to none and an audio experience that I would call enlightening if you've never tried a pair of Shure earphones before. I find wearing the foam inserts for a few hours starts to strain my ears a bit...but I mean listening to music for 2 hours would strain your ears no matter what you're using. I've fallen asleep with them on, so they are comfortable enough. If, however, you decide you want a richer sound with more bass and crisper highs and balanced mids, the SE425 experience is sublime. I have no regrets spending the money on these. It was well worth the upgrade. Next on my list is the SE846...if a grand ever falls in my lap."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like them. Great sound, very natural, well balanced. Not too much bass. They provide great detail in the music. I compared against the Sennheiser iE80 (I love Sennheiser) but these seemed like a better deal and so far, so good.

Only issue I had was getting the sleeves off, which were stuck on the post that the sleeve sites on. I ended up breaking the post right off on the first set I got. Fortunately, Amazon made returning it so easy and got me a replacement 3 days later. I did contact Shure and they sent this link http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3788/track/AvNu_QquDv8S~brxGkQe~yL3NvkqaS75Mv~M~zj~PP8F

4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this one star less because I am a long time Shure user and I was slightly disappointed in the frequency response range. Only reason I say this is because I had just used the 315 series for almost 3 years and enjoyed the rather round sound on these headphones which included decent but not perfect bass. The 425 series seems to learn towards brighter highs and leaves the lows behind, which surprised me. I figured a more expensive set would have a slightly better rounding of sound than the less expensive version (while obviously leaving room for improvement for the even more expensive models). As it stands I have been able to get better bass response from these units using some creative tuning through both software equalizer on the source unit as well as a headphone amp (FiiO) bass boost settings. I expect to get plenty of use out these, sound great with tripple flange tips. If I could re-buy I would spend the extra $$ for the next version up. I paid retail price and have not been solicited to write this review. I will continue to be a Shure user for a long, long time."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For those looking for an upgrade from the Shure SE215s, these WILL have a lot more detail and sound nicer, but personally, I was disappointed with the amount of bass (especially how much punch it didn't have) and the SE215s for sure had more bass. I ended up picking up some SE535s used on eBay for slightly cheaper and they are very satisfying. I'm sure they have their place, but there was a big lac of bass in my opinion."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's my review after two months of using the SE425.

First of all, I'm not an audiophile but I do appreciate good quality sound. My previous earphone was the Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK NoiseCancel Earphone BK! but it was bulky because of the battery compartment. I also have a Shure SE530 Sound Isolating Earphones which I use mostly at home because the wiring looks fragile.

Anyway, my Audio Technica set broke (wiring problem) and I decided to get the new SE425.

Sound quality -
I can't really differentiate between this and my SE530. In that respect, I'm really happy about this purchase. I listen mostly to instrumental music, soundtracks and orchestra, and the clarity is amazing. I also listen to podcasts and the voice quality is great as well.

Sound Isolation -
The foam buds are fantastic at blocking out noise provided if you fit them properly in the ear. On the train, you can see people talking, but you won't hear anything coming out from their mouths. The only noise comes from the vibration of the train. Sometimes, when not listening to music, I put it on just to block out noise.

Be careful when crossing the streets with the earphone on. You won't be able hear the traffic coming.

Detachable cable -
The cable detachable now and the bud swivels freely from it, just like a door knob. The cable looks thicker, and upon looking closely, you can see the additional Kevlar wiring intertwining cable, making it look really durable. The cable near the bud has additional coating which makes the cable retain the shape (after going round the ear). Let's just say that the cable won't be subject to wear and tear anytime soon. The cable is also quite long.

Fit -
The bud has a more block-like design, compared to the SE530 which is rounder. I think the bud is designed to fit in the ear with cavity around it holding it in place. My ear is a bit small so if it doesn't fit well, the bud will come out of the cavity (but with the foam still in the earhole). How well it fits will affect the sound isolation.

It takes some time to get used to the over-the-ear way it's meant to be worn. It is better to wear it that way because it minimizes the cable shaking in front of the chest.

Other stuff -
It comes with a casing for keeping the cable which I thought is very useful.

Conclusion -
I can't differentiate the sound quality between this and the pricier SE530 (possibly the SE535 as well). Having said that, I ""saved"" some money from not buying that. The SE425 is still expensive but it's worth it because I know I'll be using it for a long time.

My rating is 4.5 out of 5 stars."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to own the Shure E3s, but accidentally left them on a plane after a trip. :-(

I was quickly looking to replace them, as I am *always* using my headphones. On the subway, bus, at home, flights... everywhere!

The SE425s looked like the approximate equivalents of what I owned, so that's what I ended up buying.

In comparison:
- they sound great. I normally listen either from my laptop direct out or from my phone. If I'm using my phone, I have a graphic EQ preset to balance out the poor driving power of my phone's headphone-out.
- they fit a little less well. These use a foam earpiece instead of the tri-flange I was used to on the E3, and it took some time to get used to. After a year of use, I recognize that the seal tends to be better once you achieve it, but it's harder to achieve.
- they stay in put while walking/moving around. I had problems with my E3s coming out.

If you liked previous models of Shure in-ears, you'll probably like these."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very expensive earphones by most people standards. But SE425s are the best I've owned. The sound isolation is much better than my previous phones, the SE210s. The flexibIe wire allows you to wear these more like the IEMs that musicians wear on stage. They also provide a very secure fit too. I prefer a flatter, balanced sound in my in-ear earphones, and these fit the bill to a tee. I tend to use these with a headphone amp and software eq if I want more bass and treble. But the flatness allows me to listen to all genres of music, whether it's hip-hop, metal, jazz, classical or electronica with little to no tinkering.

If you have the money and a love for reference headphones with great sound isolation, these are the headphones for you."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose IE2i and Bose AE2
I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear STIE
Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off. The earphones wiggle a bit when running, though not enough to break the sound seal. Relatively expensive.

Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comes with a variety of ear inserts. Comfortable once dialed in with the right insert. Seem to provide excellent blocking of outside sound and I'm happy with the sound they produce.
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tony Tiger would find these in-ear monitors to be wonderful. They do a pretty darn good job of noise cancelleing, and you can feel the bass frequencies in your chest somehow! I love them.

If you sing and/or smile while you play, you may experience a little moment of silence in your head, but of course you must try all the ear tips (included) so that you might find the ones that suit you best. You won't want to use any standard headphones in your iPod or record player or CD player... Or whatever!!"
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are totally worth the money, but keep in mind that these are for audiophiles, not bassheads. The mids and highs are incredibly clear and detailed, and the soundstage is the best of any earbuds or headphones I have ever worn; you will hear thing in songs that you have never heard before. The bass is somewhat lacking on all the earpieces but the yellow ones (which are very slightly uncomfortable). The yellow ones form an amazing seal and deliver the accuracy of all the other ones as well as some extra bass. Deadmau5, Noisia and Koan sound sound really good on these, but these are definitely not for listening to Skrillex."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my new se425's and have listened to just 3 of my favorite CD's. All I can say is wow! Excellent audio quality and they will only get better as they break-in over time. I'm glad I didn't pop for the se535's for an extra $200.00. (More bass I don't need.) I couldn't be happier with the se425's. I would say that the se425's are 5-6 times better than the old e3c's I had back in 04.

BTW, I always use the 3-flange white rubber ear stems. They seem to make the best seal and produce the best low frequency effect. I'm a happy camper! :-)

One more thing . . . when placed in the ear with 3-flange in-ear earpiece, the unit sits flush / flat and does not protrude outside the ear -- making it perfect for use with motorcycle helmets."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality , wonderful mids and highs. Bass is ok but the lack of it drove me to purchase the se535's where I finally found complete satisfaction . It worth the extra cost in my opinion to go with the se535's. Even the se315 provided me better bass and excellent sound quality, but it uses a dynamic drivers and lacks the accuracy of the se425 & se535's balanced armature speakers."
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The dual drivers provide good sound reproduction with very little distortion. The supplied buds provide excellent noise cancellation and keep the music clear and unobstructed by ambient noise. The formable upper wire conforms and holds to any shape which helps to keep the ear pieces in the canal and rarely comes out on it's own on the stage or while moving about.

As pertaining to stage use, I highly recommend using an extension of some sort, as the included cable is far too short. The fit is exceptional, and I am able to move freely without concern of having the buds forced out of the ear canal, since the formable wire really helps hold them in place over the ear lobe. I run the cable up my back, and pull on the plastic clip to secure the cable in place, by pulling against the back of my head. The clip holds well, and keeps everything in place as it should.

The amount of different earbuds is almost obscene; there's many fitment options that should allow one to custom-tailor each ear piece to fit perfectly in the ear canal, even if one of your ear canals is of a different size than the other (should that ever be a factor).

The sound:

Bass Frequency: The lows are not overly bass-y - it is more of a reference sound that does not attenuate any one frequency compared to another, and seems to accurately represent the low end without being boomy, and so the mids and highs are nice and clear, without having any distortion since the low-mids/bass are separate from the highs, by design.

Mid Frequency: The mids are clearly defined and I would say that the SE425 really focuses the sound where it should be for vocals, guitars and toms, snares and symbols. There is a nice big, spacious sound stage that is pleasing to the ear, without sacrificing clarity.

High Frequency: The highs are slightly mellowed to the point that they are clearly audible, but not overly amplified or painful to listen to. Symbols are present without being too ""tinny"" sounding; guitars are as good as can be coming from our church's mics, console, and amplifiers, though I do not blame the ear phones for the stripping away of the tone that guitars should have. But, in mastered recordings, guitars come through clearly and sound as they ought to with an organic feel.

Overall Impression:

If this pair got lost or stolen, I would probably not want to afford to replace them, and would settle for the SE215 instead, since they have the same outer plastic and formable wire, though the driver technology and amount of drivers is different, having only one driver. When listening to recordings, the sound is pleasant and provides a full spectrum of audio that exceeds most cans that I have used (though I must confess that I have only auditioned a few decent cans). The ""size"" of the sound is big and spacious and affords the listener a rewarding experience so long as the canal is sealed properly. And since there are plenty of options for sealing the canal, there should be no issue in finding the right size of bud to use to seal off the canal from ambient sound. If the seal is not secure, a lot of bass is removed from the experience, and so sealing off the canal is vital to getting the most out of these in-ears."
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own this earphone for a week and my amazement forced me to write about it, First impression was kinda disappointing for me maybe because its my first In-Ear monitor to try but shortly after i realized how wonderful the listening experience on the shure se425 is. I'm the kinda person who like loud and punchy sound but the shure soft of changed the way i think, now i don't tend to turn the volume all the way up and i can listen and be very satisfied from the lowest volume because i can hear every element of the music very defined and present in my head, its like audio signal wired to my brain directly.

I'm 100% satisfied."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My fiancé asked me to purchase these for his job. He's a band leader who has taken his group to total wireless. All members of the group have wireless earphones. Price is high, but that's the manufacturer, not Amazon. Arrived on time. Good packaging. Decent earphones. Shure makes a good product."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is what allows me to forget my surroundings and get lost in the music or listening to my favorite audio book. Shure has a very straightforward approach....keep it simple and provide the highest quality of sound. You will pay premium but it is worth every penny. With a million miles of flying this was my #1 tool to block out outside noise while i listened to my favorite tunes or not listening to any music at all
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first set of mid priced ear buds, I am blown away with what I am hearing, if you are on the line about forking over the cash for these little gems, don't be,"
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so here's the straight on these headphones. Most importantly- they are not meant for every day use with your ipod, ect. I know Shure markets them as such, but let's be honest, they're personal monitors and should not be used for anything else. All you have to do is look at them to know- they look like hearing-aids and they wrap around the back of your ears... like hearing-aids. This said, they look cool when you're wearing them on stage- they make you look like a real performer without having to pay the price for a pair of custom in-ear monitors.

Specifics:

Pros:

-Extremely clear (perfect for monitoring a mix or playing live). You can hear everything you will most likely hear instruments or parts you never heard before when you listen to music.

-Comfortable: If you put them in right, they can be comfortable for 2-3 hours before they start to wear on your ears a bit.

-Excellent sound reduction: These will cut out basically all ambient noise when you form a good seal. Also, they are great to wear while practicing drums or playing live. They cut out enough noise to let you hear your music/mix and protect your hearing.

-Cables are detachable, meaning you only have to buy a new cable if it breaks instead of a whole new pair of headphones. The construction looks great to me so I don't think this will be a problem any time soon.

Cons:

-Takes some time to get a good fit if you use the foam ear buds, but it gets easier when you get better at putting them in.

-Lacks bass. Like I said, these headphones should be used for monitoring, not casual listening. The response is very accurate and tight, but even so I could use some more bass."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Compared to the westones and price not bad for drums and bass. Not keys or vocals. They are warm.
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very upset....with myself for not getting them any time sooner. A friend let me listen to his 425 and I was sold. Same night ordered. I happen to fly a lot and never could hear well due to airplane noise what I was listening to even at maximum volume which became painful to ears. So flew 4 times with the 425 ....what can i say once they are on you forget where you are. I like loud music and now I dont even go past 75% volume.Clean sound of music, very clear and have plenty of bass for me."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were not my first pair, I discovered Shure a few years back and owned 530 and other models, I have always enjoyed the sound quality they can give you. The one problem I had was that after heavy use around 1.5 year or more they wire would wear off and sometimes break right around the connection to the earphone. Luckily they offered a two year warranty and would always replace them with a new pair. Now with this new design, you can easily swap the wires for new ones and if you purchase (like I did) the remote/mic wire, it's a perfect combo to use with your cellphone or ipod. The price is certainly not cheap but compared to a pair of Bose headphones with sound isolation I would go with Shure without a doubt."
4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,liked them so well bough another pair
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am on my 4th set of the SHURE SE425 headphones over the last 7 years and the only reason is because I lost them or the dog ate one set.
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleeves were stuck to the drivers, but a quick web search fixed that. Just pop 'em in the freezer for a few hours and they come off. It takes some patience.

The plug is larger than the provided hole in my iPhone case, so I can't plug it in without removing the case. Solved with a small file to modify the case.

The sound is great. I had a few test songs picked out to decide whether to keep or return them, and 20 seconds into the first song they are keepers.

I look forward to ignoring the rest of the world, insulated from the screeching masses."
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I have quite a few years of audio experience and this set is great compared to all of the in-ears I have had.. My primary music I listen to is Electronic, Jazz, Orchestra, Classic rock, and a little pop. My favorite has to be vocal trance music (electronic trance music with vocals).

Sound:
Highs are clear and very nice. Not too shrill or exaggerated. Right where I feel a good sound is supposed to be. Hi hats and others at that level are clear and crisp.
Mids are SUPERB and vocals sound like the artist is right there in my ear. Synths are bright and feel almost emotional with the vocals. Guitar riffs sound swell and like it is from my personal amp.
Low: Good and not overpowering. Bass is tight and comfortable. People on various review complain about the lack of bass. It even says on the box that a GOOD SEAL IS HOW TO GET GOOD LOW END. With the Comply tips I get a great seal that does not hinder sound due to a a poor seal from other tips.

**note that the tips that come with the Shures didn't seal right for me and the best sound came from the Isolation Plus tips made by Comply**

With the Comply tips people complain of muffled sound. I read that the tips have to be cut so that the end is flush with the earwax guard and this has made the sound so good that the Shure headphones are in the top 2 in ears that I have ever owned.

People say that the yellow foam tips that come with the headphones work great but get dirty and don't poof up as well. I stick them in a sock and throw it in the washer and they come out like new after letting them air dry for 10-12 hours. I learned this trick from a Shure thread on a forum.

tl;dr: Top sound i have ever heard but need a good seal to get good bass. Comply makes Isolation Plus that do the trick. Can wear for hours."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these buds to replace an older pair of Shure E3's. I play drums in a rock cover band that gigs up to 7 times a month and use these with my personal in-ear monitoring system. So far, these 425's have been GREAT! They do a tremendous job with sound isolation and even with all the moving around I do, stay firmly sealed and in place. I particularly like the idea of detachable cables from each bud so that you don't have to buy an entirely new rig if you blow a driver or break a cable."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality performance is entirely dependent on the earpieces you choose. Choose wisely! ;-)
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are well constructed, the cable is very well made and replaceable.

If you've not worn this type before, be aware the cable routes over your ear and is a different fit than most headphones and are more like monitors in their design.

The sound isolation is perfect, I love not hearing others while I listen to music.

I personally found the bass to be just right and did not feel it was lacking.

Overall sound clarity is great but I am no audiophile.

The case is kind of bulky and I won't use it as a result."
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them as a Christmas gift for my partner Stuart who travels back and forth internationally. He loves them. He's happy. I'm happy!
2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been into good quality music, and have never paid more than $80 for a pair of headphones, which happen to be BOSE. I always thought their quality of sound was amazing, and couldn't be beat. So, I went and bought the BOSE noise canceling ear buds. I thought they sucked for what they were suppose to do, and did some more research and found these. The quality is amazing, and you can hear every little bit of the music. Great product which I will use for years to come."

4,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally had to buy a replacement for my trusty E2C's that I've had for years. Although I loved the Shure brande and was sold on the E2C's I had a hard time spending this kind of money on earphones..... But let me tell you they are worth every penny and then some!!!! They even have better ambient noise suppression than my brother's BOSE Quiet Conforts! And now that they have replaceable cords, I won't have to throw them out when the cord dies. Would buy them again in a heartbeat though. (And the new design fits MUCH better than the old one, can't even feel them when they're on!)"
5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,The clarity of these is stunning. Without a doubt the best listening experience I have had thus far. Two notes of caution: 1) the instructions will tell you this too but you *MUST* get them seated in your ears properly for them to sound right. And 2) they aren't amazing in the bass department. So if you're looking for something to rock hard then you need to pair a headphone amp with them. I am planning to do just that. The audiophile's quest never ends...
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent
7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of both the Shure 535s and 425s. I have previously owned the Shure E5s and 530s. I am replacing my 530s because I accidentally left them on a plane in a rush between flights, bummer.

So after reading other peoples Amazon reviews of the 425s and the 535s I decided to try the 425s to save some money. My first impressions were: Nice build. Cool detachable wires. I am glad they brought back the formable wire around the ears. The cord is lighter, stronger, and nicer. The cord is not modular anymore. I like the silver color under the clear plastic. They fit kinda differently, mildly uncomfortable in my concha (not the ear canal). The sound is the clearest yet. Where is the BASS? (yes I know how to make a proper seal in my ear canal)

I hoped maybe the 425s needed to be broken in properly, though I previously haven't had a need to break in my other Shure headphones. So I let them play for a few days and then tried again, but as I had feared the 425s still sounded very lacking in the low end. The odd part is they can reproduce frequencies all the way down to 20Hz, but they really roll off in volume at about 100Hz. If the music had any mids or highs the bass felt lacking. So I ordered the 535s.

First impressions of the 535s: Exactly the same shape as the 425s, the cords are interchangeable and the dimensions are identical. I like having the clear plastic option again but think I prefer the new color on the inside of the plastic style. Here is the bass the 425s lack. The 535s sound very much like the 530s but even clearer. With the increased clarity, they also sound brighter than the 530s.

To my ears the 425s and 535s sound the same above about 100Hz. In fact, to me, the 425s sound like a great pair of bookshelf speakers with a misplaced subwoofer. Keeping with the speaker analogy, the 535s would be towers in the same line with the same tweeter and mids but also integrated subs. In terms of production I cannot imagine the 535s cost $200 more to make, but to my ears the 535s are the only way to go. As someone else mentioned if you only listened to older recordings or classical music (without timpani or cannons) the 425s would most likely work well, but they do not work for rock, rap, or electronica.

I think I actually would choose the 530s over the 535s or the 425s. The reason is, I find the 535s a bit too bright despite them being clearer (I am the type of listener who prefers tubes and electrostatic speakers). And while the new cables are better, have the formable wire around the ear again, and are replaceable I miss the modular design and don't like how the headphones rotate. Since they rotate around where the wire connects to the headphone it is harder to use the formable wire to maintain the proper alignment in my ear and insert them. All of my comparisons to the 530s are based on memory, because I lost them. I will be returning the 425s and keeping the 535s.

I did most of my listening using my zune 120 and hp laptop with a nuforce icon mobile headphone amp using high bitrate ripped wmas and amazon bought mp3s."
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of earphones. Pricey but the quality is great, don't get caught up in the beats hype (I've had beats) go with a quality set like these."
9,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these daily on the subway and the make my commute so much nicer. I had the Bose headphones which don't provide a tight seal so I always had to turn them up to compensate for outside noice but these block out noice so I can enjoy music or audio books without worrying about damaging my hearing. The only compalint I have is that the Bose earbuds had more bass which I liked, but I guess these are more balanced."
0,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound coming from these small earphones is spectacular. However the wire that goes over the ear is too stiff to mold over the ear. I am hoping that with more use the wire becomes more pliable. There is no clip to attach the long and heavy cord to your shirt or clothes. I used the earphones on a long flight and the noise cancellation feature worked extremely well. Once the earphones are correctly fit into the ear they work quite nicely.
1,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a retired musician and video producer. I've been using Shure earphones for years and have had only one complaint. When the cable went so did the earbud. So this time I spent a little more and upgraded the sound quality and design. The dual hi-def driver is awesome. I'm hearing things in my music and movies I never heard before. Plus I'm no longer worried about my investment being a total loss because a cable breaks. Just order a new cable. Buy them.

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as an upgrade to some old SE210's. The SE425's make the SE210's sound like beats by dr.dre. haha. But seriously, the SE425's have an incredible level of detail without just having boosted treble. They are significantly more articulate.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BASS??
yes, the bass SEEMS weak, just like the SE210's. The treble isn't boosted either, but you don't hear complaints about that. They're reference earphones, so they just reproduce what's there with no hype. I like that. No hype means I get to enjoy what's actually there. This is great for checking mixes, auditioning channels, or monitoring audio.

To each his own, but if you like stunningly accurate sounding earphones, these are pretty sweet. If you liked the SE210's, you'll love these."

5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing these with previous sets of Etymotics and Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi in-ear headphones, I think these are the best combination of fit and sound. Getting the fit right is the critical factor for in-ear headphones, and the particular design of these Shure headphones nests them inside the ear in a natural way that is both comfortable and functional, because the headphone stays put in the ear and bass response stays clear. I found that Etymotics have a weak bass and really go deep into the ear, which is a feeling that I imagine a lot of people will find uncomfortable. I know I did. The Triple-Fi headphones have outstanding sound quality--about the best I've heard--but start to hurt pretty quickly (I found 45 minutes to be about my threshold). And they do not have replaceable cords, a nice feature of the Shures.

The Shure headphones do have some issues; the cord needs to wrap around the outside of the ear in a particular way to keep them fitting correctly and it takes some time to get them right. But once the cord is fitted, it remembers the shape and they are easier to get on after that. It's not clear which one is 'left' and which one is 'right' and it's possible to put them in the wrong ear; I've done it. (The Triple-Fis don't really go into the wrong ear because of their shape.) And, of course, it takes a few attempts with the different sizes of foam pads to figure out the right one. These mostly are issues about getting the fit right. Also, my first purchase of these headphones had an issue with one channel cutting out when I moved my head. Amazon took care of getting a replacement with its usual fast speed, but it suggests some quality control problems."

7,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is great but the cable came with problem as left side earbud volume is much smaller than right side and twisting the cable sometimes makes the left side volume normal. Quite upset with the cable.
8,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the quality of the sound. The ear pieces take a while to feel comfy. For what I am using them for they are working great!

2,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On my last trip to Italy I took off my Bose because I was sweating around the ear, put in my Shure's for the rest of the trip! Just the best in biz, hands down.."
3,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"....I purchased a pair of SE425 ear buds to replace a set of Shure e4c earbuds that died a premature death from wire insulation ""rot"" thinking that the replaceable cords would solve the problem. Well they do, but there is another problem inherent in the design that is not readily apparent....until you try to replace the sleeves with new ones. With my pair, the sleeves(only had them for 5 weeks)had become fused to the stems. So upon trying to remove them following the instructions in the manual, the stems snapped off!!! Well, with e4c buds they are replaceable but with the SE425 buds the stems are an integral part of the earbud and are NOT replaceable. My suggestion to those who purchase these is that the 1st thing you do when you get them is to try to swap out the sleeves sometime before the Amazon 30 day return policy expires. Hopefully the 2 year warranty will save the day for me. I will keep you posted!

OK.... its 2/24/11 and I got my replacements already from Shure. Great turn-around! Raised the star value up to a 4 from a 1. They sound great but I am still disappointed in the fact that the stems are not replaceable. Although the sleeves remove easier on this pair, I would guess that this will happen again sometime in the future. Maybe with the next generation of earbuds, they will get it right. Would I buy them again? Yep! I like them that much!"

5,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and came at reasonable time!
6,Shure SE425-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Dual High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to augment my Shure SE215s. I love the SE215s, they sound great they isolate so much noise I use them over my noise canceling head phones. These earbuds fit so snugly into the ear that I can sleep with them in and not feel any pain.

In comparing them to the SE215s the lows are just a little deeper and the highs are much clearer. These headphones are phenomenal. I've owned beats by dre, Bose Mie2s, and many other sets of eat buds. No other set of ear buds compare.

The only things I would call drawbacks are the lack of inline controls and the size of the plug. The plug is just a little too large to fit in the slot in the case for my iPhone."
