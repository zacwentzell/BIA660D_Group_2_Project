0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose IE2i and Bose AE2
I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear STIE
Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off. The earphones wiggle a bit when running, though not enough to break the sound seal. Relatively expensive.

SE215
Great balanced sound; strong bass; low impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an audiophile that likes to get out and walk around while listening to music, so I've always aimed to get the most I can out of portable equipment. Using my iPhone 6 Plus with Spotify and Tidal Lossless, I listened through a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-990s (250ohm) powered by a FiiO E12 I carry around in my back pocket. This setup, for me, remains unbeatable in terms of audio quality; it's like a concert on your head. But unforeseen circumstances made me seek out my first pair of IEMs in a long time.

The last IEM I owned was the Klipsch Image S4, a popular one at the time that was widely praised for sounding 10x what it cost. But I knew I'd need something at least as good as my DT-990s if I really wanted to be satisfied; or at least, I'd need something that could give me that ""Wow"" when a song comes on I haven't heard before and I can hear every detail.

I'll tell it to you straight, if you're a fan of open-back headphones - hell, any headphones that sit on your ears at all - odds are you aren't going to find an IEM that can live up to that experience, at least not without paying an insane price for it. At $500, the Shure SE535 should be the headphone that at least meets you halfway, and I can say that it just about does. But this is not an IEM with that ""Wow!"" factor.. actually it seems to be an actively anti-""Wow"" pair of headphones. Take these out of the box and (after fiddling for several minutes) get them in your ear, the first thing you'll notice: they're damn comfortable for IEMs, mostly thanks to their smart but annoying design by which they basically hang on your ears. Now, turn on your favorite song, here it comes!... annnd... fizzle. Wait... what is this? Is this what I paid $500 for..? Are you kidding me?! This is the point where you have to have a little patience, giving your brain time to adjust to the new sound and the headphones time to show you what they can really do. Two words that should be printed on the bottom of the box: Keep Listening. Play song after song, and oddly enough, you'll find they start sounding better and better, and the SE535's character really starts to come out. The most forward, gorgeous rocking mids I've heard in probably any pair of headphones. The highs are so wonderfully detailed and flavorful, when singers hit those super high notes that would normally make you cringe in fear of pain, you instead feel an almost orgasmic sensation in the center of your brain, like their voice is reaching all the way into your brain and bouncing around in your skull. The lows and bass are understated, but certainly there, and they come out when they need to.. but hardly ever otherwise. This kind of sound profile actually has the unusual effect of making old, say pre-1940s vinyl recordings and mono mixes, sound amazing; listening to Jimmie Rodgers yodeling T For Texas sounds like having him right in front of you (don't let him sneeze on you). I was impressed by how much character these IEMs have, despite my initial disappointment that they didn't live up to my (perhaps absurd) expectations. All in all, I'll just break it down into pros and cons, so you can decide for yourself whether these are right for you in 2015.

Pros:
-Quite comfortable, and the box includes a ton of different ear tips to choose from. The box, by the way, includes many useful accessories, like cables and a well built hard case that can easily fit in your pocket.
-Orgasmic mids and highs
-Great soundstage for an IEM with good isolation as well, a rare combination.
-Full of character, but not overstated; the music sounds fun, without compromising the detail.

Cons:
-Same design that makes it so comfortable makes it incredibly annoying to put on, as you have to lay the cord over your ear; this becomes profoundly more irritating if you have long hair.
-Lows are understated and this seems to cost on sharpness and detail; instruments, for example, are more difficult to tell apart despite the 535's good soundstage. Bass is there, but has little punch or character.
-A little too expensive for what you're getting. But this is also the best IEM I've ever owned, and I haven't owned many.

Recommendations:

I strongly recommend using an amplifier with the 535. It will bring out MUCH more detail and really push the IEMs to their full advantage. Not all headphones, particularly IEMs, benefit from amping but these definitely do. The lacking of bass can be corrected entirely with a proper amp, and the 535 handles a thumping bass excellently. I'm using the FiiO E12 I was using previously with my DT-990s, which is sort of overkill for a pair of IEMs, but it does sound heavenly- just be sure to be careful with the volume on any amplifier, as the 535's are low impendence and don't need much juice to get them going."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my third Shure earphones. First purchase was the SE530PTH back in 2010. Upgraded to SE535-CL in 2012. I fly a lot and usually on long flights (10+ hours) and found these to be the best for sound, comfort, and for blocking out all the noise on a plane. I like that they are in-ear and not over the ear like other noise-cancelling headphones. I often fall asleep on a plane while listening to music. I can get comfortable and twist and turn and not have to worry about what position my head is in. I've tried the Bose and Sennheiser earbuds and think the Shure are much better for sound and fit.

Shure's customer service is great. Over the past 8 years I've only had a couple of issues. Fortunately, it happened while the earphones were covered by their warranty. Shure replaced earphone assemblies without any hassle. I lost my SE535-CL last week and had to get them replaced before my next trip. I decided to pay $50 more to get the limited edition SE535LTD because they have a slim volume control in the photo on Amazon. The SE530PTH I bought back in 2010 had volume controls, but they were very bulky.

The SE535LTD comes with 2 sets of cables. One has the slim in-line volume controls and one with a single button for ""Media phones"". There's isn't a cable with no controls. First improvement I noticed were with the new cables. They aren't as stiff as the SE535-CL cables and there's a nice bend in the connector (see photo). The bent connector rests comfortably on my ear, and the softer cables go over and behind my ear without having to tug on them. With the previous cables I had to occasionally tug them down to keep them over my ear. It comes with a bunch accessories including different sleeves, an adapter for the 2-pin plugs found on some aircraft, and an analog volume control. I used them for a couple hours with my Galaxy S7 Edge and, as expected, they sound great.

That being said, I can only give the SE535LTD 4 stars. I'm annoyed that for the super high price, Shure still doesn't include a cable with in-line volume controls that work with Android phones. One cable has only one button and is meant for placing calls (no volume controls). The other cable with the in-line volume control buttons only work with iPhones. I understand that back in 2010 iPhones had these fancy features and the Android phones didn't. It's 2018 and you can get in-line volume controls with cheap $10 earbuds, but I can't get them in my $500 Shure earphones? The analog volume control Shure provides is clunky and it's on a short ""leash"" (see photo). I would like to control the volume without having to pull my phone out my backpack or coat pocket. I would give the SE535LTD 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of a good volume control option."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful clear realistic multilayered sound! Super comfortable. I’m a budding home recording artist, with a head injury that makes over-the-ear phones painful to wear. Being able to hear the subtleties of interwoven parts is so key to my work. If these weren’t so expensive I would wear them everywhere. Love the interchangeability with cords. I’ve tried the Klipsch headphones at the same price point. The klipsch had beautiful sound, but were heavy and very fragile feeling. These have equal if not better sound differentiation and superior volume control. They are also much more compatible with all my devices than the klipsch were. They are super comfortable for long sessions, and cancel out the noise, while still allowing you to hear your vocals and volume clearly.

I’m giving this 5 stars even though... As usual, Amazon’s idiot packing department packaged them in an oversized box with insufficient padding for electronics (one small piece of deflated plastic). Thankfully, these do not seem to have been damaged during shipping by their incompetence, unlike 2/3 of the electronics I’ve had to return to them due to crappy packing, resulting in product damage. FYI, Amazon’s packing department doesn’t care if your products are damaged during shipping, so just expect that you may have to return anything electronic at least once. Which is sad, because if they took more care with their shipping department, they would not have as many returns due to product malfunctions:("
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I felt compelled to write a review of these IEMs having obsessed about them for months now.
They are all very good!
They should be for the price! Haha.

So where do I begin?
Most important, above all is sound quality.
They are all good with certain signature differences.

I have been using Etymotics for years.
Using the Etymotic hf3.
Excellent overall. Very accurate. Just not a lot of punch or presence to the bass.
It's there but doesn’t hit you over the head.

I tried other brands of phones and found them to sound inaccurate or sloppy.
I had some older Shure IEMs and I wanted to see if their newer models sounded better.
I tried the Shure SE315. and the Shure SE425.
Didn’t sound as good as my old model. Back they went.
Decided I would need triple drivers to get a significantly better sound.
Bought the Shure SE535. Lots of money!
And wow! Very impressive!
Having come from the Etymotics, the sound is very different.
Its warmer and slicker sounding. The voice range is a little less forward, which may be simply because the bass presence and detail is huge compared to the Etymotics.
The Shure SE535s are very entertaining to listen to.
More so than the Etymotics.
With the Shures, you feel more like you are being washed with music.
With the Etymotics, it just feels more like you are analyzing the sound.
There is way more punch and space to the sound in the Shure SE535s. Almost too much punch on certain tracks. 😳

Let me go back to the Etymotics.
I tried out the Etymotic ER4XR and the Etymotic ER4SR.
Very little discernible difference. Maybe slightly more bass presence with the XR.
I have been using the Etymotic hf3 for many years.
In my opinion, the hf3 sounds as good if not better than the ER4XR.
The reason is that the ER4XR has a higher impedance than the hf3.
On an iPhone, you have to turn up the volume essentially all the way to get the full sound out of the ER4XR.
This is not the case with the hf3s. They are good at 3/4 volume.
Makes a significant difference!
Other than that, there is maybe a slightly discernible improvement in separation on the ER4XR. But I mean slight.
Overall the hf3 sounds better. And they cost way less!

And there is another point.
Comfort.
This is a tricky issue when it comes to IEMs.
After trying to use the triple flange cone tips, I gave up do to discomfort and the scariness of sticking a little plastic Christmas tree up your ear canal.
I found that using the cylindrical foam tips created just as good a sealed fit and bass response as the ""tree"" did. So that is what I use.
The Soft Flex Sleeves are also an excellent alternative. Really good isolation and amazing bass response!
That brings me to the difference between the Etymotics and the Shures.
The Etymotics are simply more comfortable.
The drivers are smaller and weigh less than the Shures. Less of a pull on your ear structure.
Shures design is supposed to route the wire over and behind your ear.
I find this distracting and annoying in addition to being uncomfortable.
My solution is to let the wires remain in front of my ears, hanging down in front of me.
Much more comfortable. (See photos)
This however, necessitates using a shirt clip to cancel out the weight of the cord pulling on your ears. I bought some from Amazon. Works well to make the phones as weightless as possible.
With the Etymotics, this is less of an issue because the earpieces weigh so much less and the foam goes straight into your ear canal.
The Shures have to kind of sit on your ear structure. Not so comfortable.
I'm hoping over time that I will be bothered less and less by this slight pressure.
It is worth it to get the sonic results that the 535s deliver.

Back to the Shures.
I payed a very large amount for the 535s. For me they are worth it for the spectacular performance they deliver. I can only imagine how nice the Shure SE846s sound.
I just couldn't bring myself to spend one thousand dollars on IEMs. I do after all have a family to support! 😛

So I am happy I have both.
I will probably usually use my 535s for my daily commute to Manhattan.
But it's nice to switch out to the Etymotics for a lighter more Spartan sound signature.

Hope this review helps some of you out there.

With streaming music, it's like being a kid in a candy store every day.
And with these headphones, You can hear the candy really really well! 😊

Edit to this review: October 9, 2016

This is an important addition to this review!
I made a discovery about the importance of source input to the performance of the se535s.
I had been listening to my music with Apple Music.
I had been detecting a slight stridency to the overall sound of the headphones.
Thought it was the phones.
But then I tried using Spotify Premium with the 535s.
No stridency!
Virtually perfect reproduction of vocals, piano, strings, bass!
As much as it pains me to say it, looks like Spotify delivers a more accurate dynamic signal.
Both great music systems. But Spotify has a slightly warmer, more realistic sound.
Wow!"
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones because I play electric guitar, and needed something good for in-ear monitoring. I had some older Shure earbuds, and those are good, but they don't have much bass. I was doing a recording recently, and was really struggling to hear the bass line. Not ok. So I did a bunch of research and decided on these. I think this was a good choice. Their sound is very clear, and covers the whole range. They are so forward and almost a little harsh that I find it a little difficult to listen to regular music with them, because they cause me some listening fatigue. I don't have this issue with my old earbuds, so that's a bit unexpected. However, I will say they are very clear, with crisp treble and good bass response. They are fantastic for in-ear monitoring of live music, which is what I got them for. So I'm happy. It was a good choice.

The only thing I don't like about these is they are a little difficult to put on. They have a bit of a funny shape, and it takes some practice to figure out the right orientation to put them on. Once they're on though, they fit snugly, and they're comfortable. They come with an assortment of earpieces. I ended up choosing the yellow foam earpieces, which are comfortable and give me a good seal, which is critical for getting good bass. They come with a little zipper case. There is not too much cord noise when wearing them, which is nice.

These easily get 5 stars."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these IEM's. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I have used them for 6 months now, for 6 plus hours a day, as IEMs, as a sound engineer, and at home for casual listening. They get better everyday. The response is amazing!"
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I'd pay $100 for a set of in-ear earphones when I bought a pair of Shure SE215s several years ago. I'm still enjoying the 215s to this day, but the roll off on the high end was noticeable. I liked the comfort and the sound so much I wanted to try their bigger brother the SE535s to see if it improved on the high end. I wasn't disappointed - the 535s have a much better high end and a fuller mid-range. I really like them. However, there are some serious diminishing returns compared to their little brother. The 215s are 80% of the sound of these IEMs for about 25% of the price."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these phones. They have an excellent, full-range response. I use them with a Sennheiser EW300 system, and they're great. HOWEVER, you only get low-end on them if they're well-sealed. I had leaky, smaller tip on them so I could hear the un-microphoned pared of the band (drums and bass) and the bass from my guitar and vocals disappeared.

The reason I wouldn't give them five stars is that I got a pair of the new Westone AM30, and they just blow the 535s away in bass response, tonal quality, and have the added advantage of attenuated, ambient sound. If you're working in large performance venues where the whole band is coming through the mixer, and there are ambient microphones, these will work fine. However, if, like most musicians, you play in smaller places, there are better options."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For three years, I owned the Shure 500PTH model, which is almost the same thing but without the detachable wires from the earbuds themselves and - based on reviews - slightly less acoustic clarity. I loved them, but after daily use (and careful TLC), the right earbud wire was exposed at the end, and although it wasn't shorting out yet, I got the Westone 4R as a replacement.

That was two years ago. I wanted to treat myself to something that I have missed for quite some time. The Westones are outstanding as well, but I find the highs aren't as crisp as with the Shure 535s. Also, on few instances, the mids would feel a just SLIGHTLY muddy in ways that I never noticed with the 500PTH.
There is ""sufficient"" bass with the 535s, but I don't like headphones/buds that emphasize bass just to provide a false sense of more dynamic sound than what's actually produced by the source material. If there IS more bass, then it should be tight, pronounced and do a good job of not bleeding away texture and fidelity in the mids or highs. Thankfully, there is enough bass to add depth and oompth to most music... and if you really want some more kick, change to foam tips and/or use an amp - such as the Fiio E18 - to hit the bass boost.
A proper DAC/amp will only make these sound that much better.

These earbuds are an outstanding representation of what good inner ear monitors can offer. They don't drive too hard power-wise, so you can plug directly into an iPhone, iPod, Android phone/tablet or whatever. Play it with regular and boring MP3s, it sounds fine.
However, it's with lossless audio tracks that the Shures shine. Coupled with a proper DAC, you'll find sonic bliss. Especially if you only used cheap buds and/or headphones (including Beats by Dre, which are horrible) in the past.

NOTE:
Make sure they are fit properly into the ears. Change around the different earbud types/sizes to find what fits your tastes the most. Different types (foam, rubber, etc..) will produce a different sonic texture. A lot of it depends on personal preference and ear size/type."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For more bass, step up to the SE846. If you decide to get the SE535, make sure you go for the red limited edition. It has a slightly improved sound signature than the clear and bronze ones. (Look it up on the web for more info on that.) Despite what people may think, some IEMs such as the SE535 do require some burn-in time to get them to sound their best.

I actually started with the SE846 and came away disappointed with it at first. I've never used IEMs before other than the typical cheap stock earbuds that come bundled with some devices. I've always been a full-size headphones guy. I decided to downgrade to the SE535 because I felt the SE846's bass was a little bit overwhelming for my taste. BIG MISTAKE in downgrading. I should've kept the SE846. The sound signature on it is worlds apart from the SE535 and not just the bass but everything else. To give you a sense of what I mean, let's just say the SE846 sounded much closer to full-size headphones than the SE535 did. If you can afford it, definitely make the jump to the SE846 without looking back. I didn't realize what I was sacrificing by downgrading. On the plus side, the SE535 is more comfortable in the ears due to it being smaller and lighter."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply amazing! The level of depth and detail they add are nothing short of stunning. I have tried all the Shure in ear monitors below this model and you can detect the difference the triple drivers add. One regret I do have is that I probably will not be able to fully enjoy anything less at this point. When listening to songs you think you know, you are exposed to sounds on the track you previously never heard. My music library is in essence all new. It is actually hard to pull myself away from my music with these.

The most accurate description I can currently think of is this: They actually give the perception of hearing guitar and bass strings vibrate.

Pros:

Truly beautiful and amazing sound
Discrete (I prefer to not have people know I am wearing or carrying around headphones this expensive. Most people don't seem to know what these are as opposed to Beats which I am sure would walk off if you left them around at the wrong time)

Cons:

Price
Can be uncomfortable with long wear (this is more me still trying to find the right foam size. You get a ton of options)"
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say, these are pretty amazing. The sound is so clear and balanced, it's a joy listening to music in nearly any setting. The bass is more pronounced than in the SE420s, which I had for about seven years (and really liked). These are a notch up, which should be expected given the price. But if you listen to music a lot, and can afford to shell out nearly 500 bucks, I don't think you will be disappointed. My only negative comment is that the sound isolation on these is a little bit lacking, even after experimenting with all of the tips that are supplied. They sound very nice with my iPhone, but when I'm listening with the 535s connected to a dedicated Onkyo amp, wow I'm impressed!"
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing the Limited Edition, red version. My office recently moved from a cubicle model to an open office. I do work that at times requires several hours straight of quiet concentration time, so I knew I would need something to allow me to get it. I read reviews on all kinds of noise cancelling and noise isolating headphones and decided that active noise cancellation didn't appeal to me. I wanted something that would sound amazing while helping to block out the sound from my now very nearby coworkers, but from what I read about active noise cancellation, it works best on steady sound like airplane engines and not sporadic sounds like people talking. So I decided to give these a try given that they were well reviewed by several different sites.
These fit the bill perfectly. After trying out all of the different tips, I have settled on the triple flange. I also prefer to wear the cord straight in front...the product literature mentions something about a formable/moldable cable, but I find the cable too unwieldy when worn behind the ears; it just doesn't stay in place well enough for me. Maybe if there was a cable cinch it would work better, but I don't detract for this because now that I've found a way that works for me, I really love these.
I actually have one problem with these though, which is what really spurred me to write this review. I recently decided to spend some time in my living listening to music on my stereo. I use a Marantz receiver powering Klipsch speakers, so it's not a cheap setup, and as I sat there listening, I realized I was missing some of the clarity I get from the Shures. My speakers aren't the latest and greatest, they aren't the reference line, but up until now I always thought they sounded amazing. But these headphones could end up making me want to upgrade my system. I could see this being a dangerous, slippery slope for some folks.
Oh, and as far as any kind of ""lack of bass"" is concerned (I've seen it mentioned in places) I don't find these lacking at all."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After searching and researching I found myself continuing to gravitate back to these earbuds. Happily I chose to purchase them and now I wear them everyday. I chose the Limited Edition Red over the others for no other reason than desire. But rest assured that these earbuds (in any color) are far superior to any I have had in the past. While I would love to have wireless for my running sessions I just can't sacrifice the quality of the sound these provide. Also, included in the package there are a choice of MANY ear sizes to chose from so you are certain to get a perfect fit. The ear pieces are also available for a very reasonable price if you later find you need to replace the ones you love the most. There is a convenient section on the cord which allows you to pause, skip, and even adjust the sound level. If you love your music as I do you will not be disappointed for choosing these. I LOVE mine."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased with these earphones. They sound amazing. The earphones are lightweight and well built. High quality materials used throughout.

Very comfortable fit once you find the right size sleeves for your ears. There are many choices and you should be able to find one that is right for you. Finding the correct fit is imperative to getting the most out of these as far as sound goes.

This is my second pair of Shure Earphones and I am sure I will be sticking with this brand for years to come.

HiDEF Lifestyle offered the best price for these and they were quick to deliver."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is designed to wrap over the top of your ears. This makes the earbud come loose, A LOT, since there is no wire on these cords. You need a tight seal to enjoy the quality sound, which means you'll be fooling with the cords constantly. I took some heavy wire and wrapped it around my ear with a bit of a hook at the top, and taped the cords to those and that helped considerably. I also ordered Comply S-100 Active earbud covers, and that helps too. (The yellow covers that come with this SE535LTD are good, but feel a bit cheap.)

Once you have them in place, the sound is EXCELLENT. If there's a lot going on in the music it tends to overwhelm the earbuds if you crank the volume too high, but hey; THEY'RE EARBUDS. If you want reference quality sound at high volume, get reference quality HEADPHONES.

I'm using a Fiio E17 headphone amp with these at 6db gain, and as long as I don't crank the sound up to ridiculous levels the sound is bright, with clear bass even at low volume. With classical or most pop, I can put the volume pretty high without distortion. Dance is clear without the bass distorting the midrange.

I would rate these earbuds a SEVEN on a scale of five if it weren't for the stupid cord design, but if you can put a bit of wire on the cords near the buds and get some secure covers you won't regret the price."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like many others started by purchasing the SE425's only to be disappointed by the sound reproduction more specifically the low end of the sound frequency range.

I really didn't want to spend the $$ to purchase ear buds, but man oh man was I pleasantly surprised at the sound quality these units produce, I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but from my perspective these reproduce sound like I have never heard before, from the clean crisp bass all the way through the high end.

Once the right fitting seal has been selected the 535's really are pleasant to listen to and comfortable to wear and they do block out ambient sound quite well, allowing for unobstructed listening to your favorite music what ever it would be, nice job Shure on these little marvels."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily the best in-ear headphones ever owned.....and better by a wide margin. I have tried many ever since the first iPhone came out in 2007. The stock in-in ear just never worked for me for reasons of both sound but also lack of ability to get a good fit. Tried Etymotic, B&O, Bose/Senheiser and various others over the years but between lack of fit, poor sound quality but often merely cables or other malfunctions forced me to new ones. This time around, with my purchase of an iPhone 6 that has a very good build in DAC, it was an opportunity to step it up a bit. An important factor for me in choosing the Shure 535's was obviously reputation but also that these are modular, include cables for IOS or Android, as well as plugs for stereo and airplane travel. Now if a cable breaks you can spend $45 for a cable.

Performance is astounding. As many reviews point out, this is not about bass but about purity of the sound. On any device, I have found that I play music at significantly lower levels then previously and more clarity along the full range. I do a lot of sport activities and use Bose Sport in-ear but can't wait to get to an occasion to use the Shure's. They are hugely anti-social as the sound immerses you and outside sounds are almost non existent with a good fit. The experience has been so good that I was going to spend another $150 for custom fit ear plugs but the fit with standard provided plugs have been phenomenal and for my purposes there just did not seem to a reason to go this extra step.

Certainly, my expectations for spending this amount of money on headphones were high, but the reason for this 5 star review are because they SO much exceeded my expectations and totally changed my perspective of what is possible.....Is it over the top, probably. Are there even better headphones out there, probably, but I doubt many in this price range.

If you afford them.....get them....you will not be disappointed."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these IEMs for a few years now and they're still going strong. I considered getting a different pair that had a bass, mid, and treble but decided to go this route since it has the dual bass and one treble. I leaned this way since I'm a professional bass player and I really wanted to have the clarity in the low end and not get that flubbing flat tire sound you can sometimes get when pushing an IEM with low end. These do not disappoint. The low end is very clear, no flat tire sound here! And the mid range and highs come through great as well but it's the ability to have the low end clear to hear the bass and drums that really make these IEMs stand out to me. Using a Music Man Stingray 5 string through Aviom monitors.

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything is great. After awhile they start to hurt your ears, don’t know if it’s because they are too big or not. Still a great earbud."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"(First and foremost, I'd like to give these a 4.75 instead of 4. They are far better than a 4.)

My Shure SE535s just arrived yesterday. I've done a fair amount of research on these, and I knew off the bat I needed to replace the tips to get the right seal. The medium size foam tips that came stock on the earbuds felt like they were SUPERGLUED on. I almost thought I was about to break the product getting them off...

It took a little while to get used to the way they're worn (this is after finding the silicon tips a much better fit). I see no reason as to why the over-the-ear shape is a necessity. I've owned many pairs of earbuds before these, all with the ""regular"" structure that I feel works better. Putting these earbuds on is neither fun or easy. I have to finnegle with the cord over the ear, and that occasionally moves the tip out of my ear canal, ruining the seal. Frustrating.

To get down to quality of the sound: Yes, it is in fact utterly fantastic. You can clearly see that from the 100+ 5 star reviews on the 535s. However, these do not fully satisfy my taste in music. Why? I was just looking for slight bit more bass response (a reason I chose the 535 instead of the 425)

On a regular basis I usually like to listed to EDM, liquidstep, electronic trance music, kaskade, blackmill, etc. And those types of songs do sound incredible through these 535s. But I feel like there could be a slight bit more punch. a little less high and mid, and a little more bass.

Many would argue this is not a ""real"" sound. I disagree. More warmth through bass would make these perfect in my mind.

So, are these worth $450? That's a difficult decision. I do not feel they are worth 4.5x my ""UrBeats"" earbuds (Yes, laugh it up people. I own a pair of beats). Additionally I feel that they are not early as comfortable as they could be. However these aside, they really do give life to my music. The clarity and precision is just outrageous. You can hear every minute detail of your music.I had to resync all my spotify songs in 320kbs for these!"
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of both the Shure 535s and 425s. I have previously owned the Shure E5s and 530s. I am replacing my 530s because I accidentally left them on a plane in a rush between flights, bummer.

So after reading other peoples Amazon reviews of the 425s and the 535s I decided to try the 425s to save some money. My first impressions were: Nice build. Cool detachable wires. I am glad they brought back the formable wire around the ears. The cord is lighter, stronger, and nicer. The cord is not modular anymore. I like the silver color under the clear plastic. They fit kinda differently, mildly uncomfortable in my concha (not the ear canal). The sound is the clearest yet. Where is the BASS? (yes I know how to make a proper seal in my ear canal)

I hoped maybe the 425s needed to be broken in properly, though I previously haven't had a need to break in my other Shure headphones. So I let them play for a few days and then tried again, but as I had feared the 425s still sounded very lacking in the low end. The odd part is they can reproduce frequencies all the way down to 20Hz, but they really roll off in volume at about 100Hz. If the music had any mids or highs the bass felt lacking. So I ordered the 535s.

First impressions of the 535s: Exactly the same shape as the 425s, the cords are interchangeable and the dimensions are identical. I like having the clear plastic option again but think I prefer the new color on the inside of the plastic style. Here is the bass the 425s lack. The 535s sound very much like the 530s but even clearer. With the increased clarity, they also sound brighter than the 530s.

To my ears the 425s and 535s sound the same above about 100Hz. In fact, to me, the 425s sound like a great pair of bookshelf speakers with a misplaced subwoofer. Keeping with the speaker analogy, the 535s would be towers in the same line with the same tweeter and mids but also integrated subs. In terms of production I cannot imagine the 535s cost $200 more to make, but to my ears the 535s are the only way to go. As someone else mentioned if you only listened to older recordings or classical music (without timpani or cannons) the 425s would most likely work well, but they do not work for rock, rap, or electronica.

I think I actually would choose the 530s over the 535s or the 425s. The reason is, I find the 535s a bit too bright despite them being clearer (I am the type of listener who prefers tubes and electrostatic speakers). And while the new cables are better, have the formable wire around the ear again, and are replaceable I miss the modular design and don't like how the headphones rotate. Since they rotate around where the wire connects to the headphone it is harder to use the formable wire to maintain the proper alignment in my ear and insert them. All of my comparisons to the 530s are based on memory, because I lost them. I will be returning the 425s and keeping the 535s.

I did most of my listening using my zune 120 and hp laptop with a nuforce icon mobile headphone amp using high bitrate ripped wmas and amazon bought mp3s."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved from stock earbuds to the Shure 535s on my iPhone 4 to listen to classical and pop encoded at 320kbps. I'm a slight sound snob, but by no means an expert. After plunking down the cash for the earbuds, I decided to go all the way and get custom-fit sleeves. Here's what you can expect:

1) Rich, spatial sound that you can listen to at low volume. With my stock earbuds, I'd be constantly fiddling with the volume control, lowering it when the high-frequency parts got piercing, raising it in pianissimo passages. It's fantastic to just *listen* and be awash in pure euphony.

2) Noise isolation. Now, you won't be enveloped in a complete cone of silence, but the setup goes a long way (think earplugs or pressing your tragus to cover the ear canal) to block out ambient noise. You can just barely hear people talking, but you won't understand them unless they're a foot away from you and you are reading their lips. On my transatlantic flight, the airplane engine hiss was dramatically reduced and I was able to enjoy the movie without futzing with the volume. Make sure you're extra careful when crossing the street with these on!

3) New life into old tunes. As other readers have commented, you'll hear subtleties you hadn't previously noticed, so you'll enjoy even well-worn songs. I rediscovered both classical pieces and pop songs alike, such as a faintly tinkling triangle or a vocal harmony that gets overpowered.

I would recommend getting custom sleeves, for which you'll pay about $50 to an audiologist for the impressions and another $150 for the sleeves themselves. Inside the box, there's an information leaflet on how to order these from Sensaphonics. My first pair, it took me a while to figure out how to put them in my ears (duh), but I find they create a very good seal and are more comfortable for me than the stock earpads, though to Shure's credit, they give you a bunch of shapes and sizes to experiment with.

Bottom line: Is this whole set-up a must-have, and is it worth the expense? I would say 'yes' if you're looking for a way to treat yourself if you just got a bonus, or a raise, or birthday money. I wouldn't live off peanut butter sandwiches for a month to scrimp, but maybe grilled cheese...."

Astounding sound quality, big sound stage
No listener fatigue
Isolates well enough to tune out noisy environments
Comfortable for long sessions (paired with Comply foam ear tips)

Cons
I can't get a good enough seal for appreciable bass unless I'm actively pressing the earbuds into my ears.
I appreciate their quality as an in-ear monitor though I found the sound less ""fun"" using the earbuds for casual listening
The size and shape are awkward for my ears. When they're flush they hurt the concha part of my ear despite the rounded edges. Rotating them up a little alleviates this but then makes the formable wires jut forward before wrapping behind my ear.
They don't stay in as well as other earbuds I've used, even using an ear tip that's a perfect fit.

I bought these when I misplaced my long discontinued Shure e2c earbuds. Though the Shure SE535 has significant improvement in audiophile grade sound quality, the Shure e2c has better seal, more bass, and less analytical sound. I eventually found my old earbuds and decided to keep both for different kinds of music listening."

9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They messed up and changed the cord design so it detaches AT the earbud portion and not like older models where it detached down lower, so the fit is weird and doesn't fee comfortable at all.

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile, but I do have a music background in cello, oboe, and piano. The music I listen to is mostly MP3s. I am upgrading from Shure 215, which I was impressed with, but wanted more.

The SE535 truly delivers with crisp highs, strong but warm mids, and punchy lows. Succinctly, this is about the best IEMs I've ever heard.

Only problem is, the SE215 is still pretty good for $400 less! Yes, between the two, the 215 sounds muddier and weaker, but does the 535 justify the sizeable price gap? You will have to decide that.

However, I am not returning my 535 if that says anything, though I doubt I would buy this again. For listening to MP3s and playing video games, this seems overkill, and I imagine some of its potential is lost on these basic tasks. The 215 still sounds quite good for the money, provided that you get a solid but comfortable seal. Even on the 535, a good seal is critical to hear its full potential.

For audiophiles seeking a truly good pair of IEMs, look no further.

Lastly, my pair required at least several hours of burn-in time before the sound started to come alive."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid a lot for these earphones, and was concerned. Why?

Nice set of earphones, however they will set you back in price. Nicely done, small enough, just make sure that you have a solid connection n the ear, i.e. noise cancelling and the sound takes over.

Klipsch goes for complete sound clarity with complete range in sounds crisp and clear. Shure empowers the music with deep strength full and complete fills you with another experience of music. It designs for you to enjoy music without the absolute clarity like klipsch that takes every nuances of sound. Shure take the music to another level. Klipsch takes on sound details. Shure takes music 🎵 to a deeper meaning giving it life and immersion. I want to get klipsch next round because I want to hear the complete range of then sound in the music every detail and every note. Right now I am enjoying Shure. I love both of them because they are different in sounds. I love Shures design. The ear piece is definitely cool and take plenty of design and science to bring out practicality and aesthetics. Hands down I cant go back to cheap headphones 🎧. Cheap buyers beware this product will drain your wallet and you will love every moment enjoying music with it. I am broke and lovin it! No regrets! My God I might be buying Klipsch X20i next. Shure 535 right now is giving me a good drug dose of music 🎶. Highly recommend! Klipsch vs Shure?
Both are pretty good!

Ps:
The first impression, I was disappointed at the beginning because it wasn’t as good. You need to get the headphone 🎧 playing the music to warm up the speakers for a day or two before it really show off it’s true performance.

You've probably not read a review that describes an electronic device as such but this describes what I've been experiencing ever since getting this new pair of Shure SE535's. I own many pairs of headphones as well as IEM's and I'm telling you that I'm having fun listening to all types of music again. So you ask me why and what is different than what I have now (which I won't mention). These IEM's really bring back the joy in listening to music again. First, pretty flat response. Bass not too emphasized, Highs not too bright or pronounced, Mids just right. Second, nice soundstage, music seems to ""pop"" and I can hear individual instruments and ""black"" (you know what I mean)... lots of space. Right now I'm listening with Schiit Modi DAC and Vali AMP... wow. Get some..."

6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's fabulous !! I love listening to music with this earphone. I never experience anything like this. It's well balance. I could hear a lot of details in music I never heard before. I always use it with my audioengine d1. They work great together. I mainly use this earphone for acoustic and country. It sounds amazing. I would highly recommend this earphone. However, the con to this is that it takes some time to put on. Once I have them on, I really hate taking it off because I have to go through the problem of putting it on again. I use it for exercise sometime and I like the feature where I can bring the wire behind my back. It takes it out of the way when I workout. Overall, this is a awesome earphone. Maybe one day I would consider getting the shure se846, the $1000 earphone.
Ps. Get the clear one if you don't want to attract too many attention if you plan to use it everywhere such as the bus, bart, library, etc because the shure logo is not as noticeable with the clear drivers. I like using this earphone in public because people usually don't know that I have a $500 earphone. I feel safe with it compare to other headphones I owe (V-moda and Bose). I live in a bad area so being flashy is not good."

0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really didn't want to spend so much for a pair of earphones, and so I bought many, many cheaper ones in a quest to find a pair that produce hi-fi quality sound. For the most point, the search was in vain (did find a few cheaper that did pretty good, such as Urbanfun dual drivers). It seemed that the earphones I tried did one or two things well, but lacked in some other way. And I have a certain ""standard"" of sound I am looking for. And so with reservations I forked over an obscene (in my opinion) amount for these. Are they worth it? Yes. But I would say if I had found the Urbanfun earphones earlier on, I might have been quite content with those (a tenth of the price). But alas, as I kept trying this or those, I found myself getting pickier and pickier, until I . . . Shure.

My annoyance at the price aside, these have fantastic sound. From lows to high the sound is even and pure. I would perhaps like a bit more on the high end (Something the Urbanfun do well--but not so well in the midrange). . . but for now, I'm done with my ""experiment."" These are the ones I go to when I want the best sound.

One word of caution, you may have to experiment a lot with the ear sleeves and position of the earphones to get the right fit for sound and comfort--getting both together is a bit of a trick (in fact, I don't wear them the way they are ""supposed to"" with the cords over the ears).

Sounds like I almost hate them? It's like that rock star everyone would hate--and eventually does--but gets away with it because they sound so good on stage. That's my analogy of these. They earned 5 stars, but only because they deliver.

[Update]

I ended up upgrading to the SE846--and glad I did (the sticker shock withstanding). The SE535 are amazing earphones, but I found the bass lacked the ""drama"" I was looking for (the SE846 exceeds my desire in that regard), and the treble could be better (again, the SE846 delivers on that). And the final niggle that led me to the upgrade was the high impedance that made them unusable with my portable devices, without an external amp; the SE846 has low impedance and works fine with my phone or tablet.

So my advice to anyone who is considering the SE535, go with the SE846 instead (if you can stomach the price)."

9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sticker shock that the shure se535-cl delivers is nothing compared to the audio quality this timy package delivers. I like the noise isolating more than the noise canceling ear phones for a couple of reasons. Noise isolating is a passive technique, the form factor is small, and the weight is negligable. The noise cancelling headphones require a power source, actually create sound to cancel the incoming sound, and are much larger and heavier than their noise isolating counterparts. The se535's deliver excellent bass from such a small size. I primarily use mine while flying, working out, and during yard work. They easily block out the whining and crying kids found on most commercial flights, they are even excellent at blocking the hum of the lawn mower as I cut my grass. I like that the cord is detachable and can be replaced while keeping the same drivers. The price is definately a hard pill to swallow but once you try these iem's out you wont regret it."

I really liked this product and ordered while in Chicago to be delivered in NewYork, at my hotel. Amazingly this got delivered within 36 hours! I love listening to music using these ear phones. The product is great and the service of Amazon was marvellous."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace my Shure E4C's which broke once again due to damage to the cable. These are absolutely fantastic. While the price is high, I think there are a few things which make up for it. In the past, my biggest complaint with Shure's professional quality earbuds is that if you want to use these with an iPhone, the jack will not always connect properly and you must sacrifice the ability to make calls and control music with the headphone controller and mic. Sure you could buy an adapter, but then you were left with a hodgepodge unmanageable mess of cords which still cost you a fortune. However, because this version includes a replaceable cord, I have just bought the replacement cable (CBL-M+-K for $50) which includes an iPhone controller and mic - so it is as good as an earphone set designed for the iPhone except it also sounds fantastic.

Pros:

* The replaceable cord is a great feature for when the warranty runs out
* The cord is really high quality, seems like it will hold up much better than previous versions
* Sound is absolutely fantastic, frequency range puts high end speaker system to shame

Cons:

* High cost
* Can get uncomfortable after several hours, may be necessary to experiment a bit with the difference ear inserts

I suspect some people will complain about the cost and suggest you stick with the SE530s, but I would respond that 1 - if you want to use it with an iPhone, the marginal cost is worth it to have the inline controller and 2 - once these things go out of warranty the marginal cost will justify itself real quick. Overall, these are fantastic and put my old E4Cs to shame (which were also fantastic). The replaceable cord means I don't have to baby these things all of the time for fear of damaging the cable (which will happen eventually with any earphone), which means I can use them more often and get more enjoyment out of them. But the sound quality is the biggest selling point obviously, it just doesn't compare to earphones even in the $200 price range that I've listened to. If you can't tell the difference, I suggest listening to a song with good base - I recommend ""Temple Caves"" by Mickey Hart - you won't even be able to hear the most powerful drum in the song with the vast majority of sound systems."

6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded from SE215. Much better treble and highs. You will lose tuned bass response but gain true bass sound.
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so freaking excited when my Shure se535s arrived. I tore the box open and pulled them from the cool metal case. I selected a song that I thought would be a good test and...I wasn't blown away. Okay, I just dropped $395 on a pair of earphones and they didn't sound much better than my broken in Shure se215s? I was beginning to panic a bit inside. My plan was to plug them into my iPod, crank up the volume and walk away so they could get burned in.

Two battery charges later and 20 hours later I tried again...

This time started by listening to my Shure se215s. Once again I listened to James Taylor - Enough to Be on Your Way. This song is a variety of highs, lows and mids. Once the song was over, I switched to the se535s and I heard it, I heard what $400 buys you. Wow! Once properly burned in, and compared to a $100 pair of earphones, my wallet sighed a breath of relief. These things really to sound wonderful but $400 worth?

Songs I used to critically test the se535s:
James Taylor - Enough To Be On Your Way. The kettle drum was tight, deep and defined. On my Shure e3c it was almost non-existent, on my se215s it was audible but faint, on the se535 it was very present. Though not as present as my Sennheiser over ear HD 280 Pros. The pluck of the metal guitar strings was crisp and detailed while Mr. Taylor's light breathy voice was crystal clear.

Enrique - Do You Know What It Feels Like (Ping Pong Song) - the ping pong ball lively bounced back and forth from one ear to the other. It's really a cool effect. Actually, there was very little noticeable difference between the se215 and se535 at the beginning of the song but as the song gets fuller, the 535s out perform the 215s.

West Bound Rangers - In Tall Buildings - Even if you don't like Bluegrass, you might like these guys. The 535s really give the acoustic, stand up bass a defined, rich sound. In the 215s, the bass sounds more like someone plucking a nice cello. The detail of the banjo and mandolin is amazing. I've never heard such a nice mix of detailed mid-range and full bass as presented to my ears in this song through the 535s. It's a real delight.

Goo Goo Dolls - Notbroken. This song can really sound muddy in lesser earphones. The driving kettle drums and dynamic instrumentations is just too much for most earphones. The song is best heard on full-range speakers like Definitive Technology BP7000s, the second best is a full, over the ear headphone but for in-ear earphones, the 535s are the only ones that can replicate the sound as is was meant to be heard.

Bella Sonus - Rincon de Espana. This instrumental guitar piece has some of the lowest bass I've ever heard in a song and completely destroys most ear buds. Even good ones sound weak once the bass hits. It appears for the first time at :48 and on a great stereo system or full-sized Sennheiser or Bose headphones, it's awesome! You should buy the song just to use as a test piece for your audio gear. But, I've never heard a pair of in-ear phones that can get close to doing the song justice. Even the 535s struggle but they do an impressive job for such tiny drivers.

John Powell - Test Drive from How To Train Your Dragon. Another instrumental piece that really gets full and at one point really throws a lot of sound at you. The thing I liked about listening to this song was my ability to hear individual instruments, not just a wall or orchestral sound and as the instruments get cranking mid-way though, the 535s keep up...easily.

Comfort, I've had them in my ears for a little over an hour listening to the above songs (and others while I type this). They are in my ears now and it's right at this point that I'm ready to take them out. They are very comfortable (using medium black olive tips), but not the most comfortable I've worn or own. That award belongs to my little white Klipsch S4i. Those little bud are really comfortable, also using Shure medium black olive tips.

Putting them on isn't all that hard. You get used to it and you'll find a system that works for you. I put them in my ear canal before looping the wire over my ears but you might do the opposite.

To me, the quality is top notch. My S4i's were so flimsy, they broke right over the stress relief attached to the plug after 9 months of use. I replaced them with the 215s.

I love the 535s. I wish Shure made a good iPhone cord. The iPhone cord they make is complete junk. One of the wires from the ""v"" to the connecting point is longer than the other side. Not intentional non-symmetry like Sony or Sennheiser buds, but only about an inch. It sucks. The quality feels cheap and...well, why put a crappy cord on a $400 set of earphones? I hope Shure fixes this and puts out a quality iPhone cord. I'd buy it.

Are these things worth $400? I say, four out of five stars worth. On a value scale, the $99 215s deliver more bang for your buck. Those things are hard to beat at under $100. The 535s are amazing giving you real bass, perfect mids and crisp highs that never stop, but they are indeed expensive. If you have the money, stop reading reviews and buy them, burn them in and love `em. They're awesome. If you have to give plasma to buy them, just get the 215s. You'll be impressed and will have money left over to buy more music.

I hope this helps."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,After three years of very heavy use my old Shure headphones wiring became too frayed and I had to get new ones. The sound on these babies is unbelievably crisp and detailed and they are LOUD. I listen to a lot of techno and there is PLENTY of deep bass in these headphones. I'm very glad I made the choice to get these. My only complaint is that the cord does not include a mic/play/pause button on it.

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know a lot of people will disagree with me but audio is very subjective and every set of ears is different when it comes to calling something a good sound. To me, the Sony MDR-7502 (I know they cost only US$50) have an amazing, amazing sound. I have four pairs, plugged permanently in places I am found the most. But I needed something for travel and after a lot of research and sadly no chance of a demo, I locked the Shure SE535 based on reviews.

Lets start with a big huge thank you to Amazon and Bestseller21 for delivering it well before the expected date. Now to the first thing you interact with, the packaging. The outer box and the metal one inside it are very nice. Things get not so nice after that for a bit. Being in advertising myself, if I were to sell something for $500, I would have added a little bit of drama to the experience of being introduced to and holding your earphones for the first time, perhaps a nicer presentation at par with the metal box which is brilliant.

The earphones themselves have a super solid feel to them, the cable feels robust to the touch. The earpieces have a finesse in their finishing, full marks. The carrying case is hard enough to protect your precious 535's inside a laptop bag as it gets tossed around through X-Ray machines at the airports. The volume control thing is a complete opposite and feels like a bulk purchase made in a hurry. The B&O A8 definitely sound much inferior but the attention to detail in the overall packaging is something to be inspired by. Perhaps Shure wanted to invest where it matters and that is how the earphones sound which is completely fair.

The tips are the same story, on the rubber ones, there is a rough wedge and once again, for a decent priced item, little details like these should not be missed. The finishing could have been much better.

Now that you are ready to plug the 535's into your music player (iPod Touch 4th Gen 64GB + AAC music converted from original audio CDs/FLAC in my case), if your heart sinks at the tinny sound, worry not, its just that you need to check the other tips. The one that creates the best seal creates the best sound. And they sound very good. I wouldn't say I was blown away immediately because for years my ears have been tuned to the Sony MDR-7502's. BUT! I have never been a fan of iPod/compressed music and the reasons I bought one was because I have a severe fear of flying and need something to reduce the drone of the engines and for use in the car. Unfortunately an iPod cannot drive the 7502's but boy do the SE535 completely transform your iPod or what!

I have tried the B&O A8 and the B&W P5's but none of them are sound isolating. The SE535 make you think you are in space with absolutely no sound in the surrounding (be very careful while using them in traffic areas, the sound isolation of the SE535 is way beyond anything else and you may not hear sounds that normally you won't miss). The vocals are amazingly clear. May be there should have been a little more bass and treble but that's up to individual taste. I listened to Pink Floyd, Annie Lennox, The Cure, Percy Faith, John Mayer, Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits and Sting. The sound is excellent I have ever heard from the iPod.

Plug them into your MacBook Pro and listen to the same tracks on VLC and its even better sound.

I request everyone here to shed some light on a peculiar thing. Different tips result in different sounds. The rubber tips allows for higher treble as compared to the rest but I found them VERY uncomfortable due to that rough ring.

If someone from Shure is reading this, please make the tips more comfortable. I like the sound of the rubber tips but they're really painful. The soft foam are alright but somehow none fit my ears, if I don't push them hard, I don't get the sound, if I push them hard, I can feel my heartbeat in my ears and sense a pressure on my eyeballs.

There is a warning in the user manual about a chemical ""known to the State of California to cause cancer"" and birth complication. Shure MUST elaborate on that and not let it drop down like a sledgehammer on the customer AFTER the purchase has been made. The warning is stupendously vague with no detailed information i.e. if it is known to the State of California, does the rest of the world not know about it or does it disagree with it? Can there be a line, if it is the case, ""The State of California is in a paranoid state"" written next to that warning?

So far the Shure SE535 are doing what I required them to do extremely well which was to provide sound isolation and excellent audio quality on the go. I will stick to my Sony MDR-7502's when I am stationary. Both of them are completely different products with their own respective roles. If you are looking for floor standing speakers like sound while moving around, go for the Shure SE535.

I will update as I experience them more.

4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a mobile replacement for my long-running Sennheiser HD650s. I wanted something pretty good to listen on the go, and something that provided excellent sound isolation. I paid $433 for these on Amazon, and here is my bottom-line, no-nonsense review.

First off, I have to admit that using these on popular mobile players like iPods, iPhones, smart phones, etc are overkill. Chances are, these are much more capable than your run-of-the-mill players, and probably deserve much better audio files than the typical 192kbps (or worse, 128kbps) compressions on most players, although space is becoming more than adequate for uncompressed or lossless versions. If you're buying these, chances are you're not short on cash for affording the space.

In terms of sound quality, I've been desiring something that can really match my Sennheiser HD650s (which used to be a pretty good overall reference headphone, but now much overshadowed [in price only, and not truly by performance] by HD800s and a flood of other competitors). I've been using an Arcam rPac USB DAC for the laptop when traveling, and a Wooaudio WA7 for home use, so in terms of amps they at least match what these headphones are capable of.

Overall, here's the bottom-line: if you're looking for earbuds that can replace reference-class headphones, then you will be disappointed. The Shures do NOT match the HD650s in terms of overall capability, sound clarity, bass and mid-range depth. But this is like saying, for example, a BMW M5 is disappointing because it does not quite match a Ferrari F430 in performance. This is really an unfair comparison: both are designed completely differently, and both have completely different intentions. I would say that in terms of portability, isolation (hands down excellent), and overall sound delivery, the Shures are worth the money IF you have the right equipment to play them. On the sound, the Shures are ""relaxed"" and do not shove things down your throat quite like the HD650s do, which tend to reveal pretty much everything with sharp detail and can be tiring to listen to at times. The Shures just deliver a good balance of highs, lows (surprisingly good for earbuds), and mids which give just enough clarity without being tiring. If you've been listening to music for a long time, you will know what I'm describing. The HDs are just that: high-def, but tiring. They're too sharp (think of it this way: cymbals clanging in-person is actually pretty nasty to listen to, and the same goes for many instruments). The Shures, on the other hand, give you musical depth and clarity without shouting about it. They offer a great balance.

I personally would prefer a little more clarity though, but I'm figuring that if my wish were fulfilled, they WOULD become tiring like the HD650s. In addition, I must admit that the Shures are already on a very high performance level. If you're upgrading from, say, Bose earbuds (""blows,"" in my humble opinion - I can't believe that a company like that gets away with selling junk like those; then again, there IS a company called Monster Cable...), you will be entering a new world. Hidden details will suddenly be revealed, but that's if you have the right equipment to drive these. On typical iPhones or SoundBlaster XFi cards probably not as much as they deserve, but they're still a discernable step up from most earbuds in the $100-200 dollar range.

Overall, I would definitely buy these again. I find myself listening to these for hours on end because of their comfort and incredible sound isolation. I could just wear these on planes and sleep because the foam buds are very comfortable. And the sound is just about right for long term listening without being harsh or too detailed. I can turn up the sound high and really relax and enjoy the music without my ears aching.

One more CRUCIAL POINT: the cables are detachable and replaceable, adding substantial service life to these. If you wreck the cable (which might eventually happen from normal wear/tear), you just have to pay ~$60 for a replacement and snap them onto the buds = problem solved. This is a major bonus point.

Overall: If you are looking for isolation, good enough sound clarity, and something unique, then these are for you. However, if you are looking for a complete mobile replacement for your big cans, then you will be disappointed. It's probably unrealistic to expect so. Trust me, I've even blown $1,300 on AKG's K3003s, and it was by far the biggest disappointment of my life - it's simply unrealistic to expect small buds to deliver the way big cans do (I returned them - I won't discuss them here because they belong in another review)."

i am using earphone for gym, running, ipod, PC audio music and gaming ( pc and handheld console PSP and DS). and I never found a decent set for my use. when i heard about noise cancelling / isolating sets, I tried one from Bose (headphone) and I was shocked. i really had great experience with that tech, but I found headphone is useless for me since i need earphone ( size matter for me ) I can't go outside and be like a nerd outside with headphone top of my head. i tried noise cancelling from bose ( they got one model ) and one from monster. they were great but i didn't think They do the job especially for gym and running since they can't be really fixed over my ear ( maybe its my problem).

i went online searching for reasonable price and the the Klipsch Image S4 earphones price got my eye. i saw the shure set and the crazy price ( and i was totally mistaken for even think about it). i went deeper into shure and i was curious why would it cost that much. most gadgets sites gave it incredible reviews. i was really hesitating but what make risking my own money is the size and features, you can fix the shure 535 into your ears and do hard sports ( running and aerobics). moreover, it got triple driver ( base and speaker ) so i went to amazon and order it. what the heck, i can sell them later if it disappoint me.

when i receive the set. set my gear and play music in my ipod and lost my mind. extremely perfect sound with base ( i like alternative music), couldn't believe an earphone could do that, kept playing my musics, went to the gym and test it on my console and never been happy like that. the 500$ didn't gone with the wind. what make me wrote this review is my crazy test. I got a 7.1 set in my pc. I playback a linkin park music on my pc, set the volume to the maximum and the shure set was in my ear with my ipod. the most tremendous isolating gear i heard in my life. i couldn't hear a single tone from my pc ( except the base that was booming my stomach :). this test made me wrote this review, i never wrote a review in my life for my stuff, But i really like to share my experience this time. i repeat again, you will never regret. this set worth every penny."

UPDATE: I have had problems with these earbuds failing if sweat gets in them. But I am still loyal because of the wonderful support I have received from Shure. Even when out of warranty, they replaced a failed earbud at no charge. I will be a life long loyal customer of Shure products."

I expected a ""full front and center concert sound"" , especially for $500. The best way I can describe the sound I experianced is listening to someone else's portable radio, about four feet behind my head. The sounds were precise, but tinny and distant. I had to return them. Ordering a set of Ultimate Ears, had really great sound last time I tried a set, so precise I actualy heard instruments in my old albums I had never heard before, rich, full concert sound.

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound phenomenal, although I'm not sure they're quite worth the hefty price tag put on them. They definitely are an upgrade from previously owning the SE-315 but I don't know if that difference is justified by 200$. In my experience they offer crystal clear vocals (as Shure always does) and a versatile range of lows, mids, and highs. Althoug not as mid-intensive as the 425, they do on the other hand provide clearer highs and lows on a much larger scale. That is all."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hurts my ears around the edges of the unit. Nice neutral sound for in-ear studio monitors but not comfortable for long hours of use.
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer the SHURE's to Sens and Westone. It just fits my ear better. But it can not compare to IE80 when it comes to classic, and W4R when listening to pop. But it can fit all music in a acceptable way. BTW I like the appearance. Not to mention, it looks so much like those used by performers on stage."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Sound quality is very good in the mid range. Vocals are very clear. Percussive attack and decay is well defined. The overall sound stage is very good. Highs are slightly harsh but not unpleasant. Bass is relatively non-existent, even with an optimum ear piece fit (which is part of the design problem). Sonicially, these are very good for vocal and acoustic performances, providing you don't move around much. If you like deep bass, look elsewhere.

Comfort is pretty good given their size, but the tradeoffs made by Shure in order to provide a reasonable fit are poor.

Cons:
The physical design is awful IMHO. After 6 months of nearly daily use, I've gotten pretty good at inserting them (requires a push and twist motion sort of like screwing them into your ears), but regardless of the ear bud material choice and size, there is never a sufficient seal or fit to give good bass response. Placement and insertion is very particular, and beats up the ear buds due to the need to slightly twist, or screw in the buds to get them to seat properly, which brings me to the cheap manufacturing..

First, I bought a pair of Shure earbuds some 15+ years ago, and the ear bud selection was virtually identical to what is provided with the SE 535s. None of them worked particularly well back then. One would hope after over a decade they might have done a little R&D to figure out a better solution. The nozzle/mount for the buds is a narrow, cheap plastic piece of junk. Today, one of them broke off (see attached picture) while changing out buds. A really bad design and manufacturing choice to be sure IMHO. It doesn't take much imagination to see the fragility of such a design. For the cost of these, this design is remarkable in its short sightedness.

Also in the image is the triple flange bud (I find they seem to work best for my ears - all other options just fall out regardless of size). If look carefully, you'll see a pinch in the outer flange, which probably accounts for the unsatisfactory seal. That pinch is caused by the need to actually twist the earphones in order to get a proper fit. Another bad design choice.

Over all, after 6 months, I'd say go to another vendor. These don't hold up given their cost."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hugely expensive but these sound like the music is originating from inside your own head, as other reviews have said.

My go-to earphones have been Shures since SCL210's, and I've had SE215's and 315s. These are clearly a cut above. It's hard to describe how much cleaner the sound is.

Two downsides are the price, if you're spending $500 on earphones you'd better get your worth out of them and the earpiece cords seem to hang more awkwardly than the other models. The included handset controls didn't seem to work with my HTC one m8 phone either.

0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these based on the great reviews. I am definitely not an audiophile but I know what I like hearing and what I don't. Perhaps it was my fault for not listening more closely to reviews but without trying headphones on it's really hard to know.

Like many reviewers have stated, these headphones lack bass. It's not completely devoid of bass but it's definitely not a main point of emphasis. I listen to a lot of modern pop music (Taylor Swift, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Josh Turner, Chris Young, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Brad Paisley, Aerosmith, Def Leppard...) and I just didn't like the way my music sounded with these headphones. I wouldn't classify myself as a basshead but I definitely like bass. These just lacked the punch I desired.

To be fair, I only used them for a bit over 48 hours or so but I wasn't happy with them so I felt it was best to just return them. They fit pretty well considering I have relatively small ears and the cord is very flexible. The cord does not utilize the flexible metal wire near the ear pieces so that's either a positive or a negative depending on your preference. The construction quality is solid too although the use of plastic nozzles is a downside for something so expensive.

In the end, I exchanged them for the Shure se846. Wow!!!!! is all I can say. Worth the upgrade for me? Yes, but your mileage may vary."

2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantasmagical! Only non-real words can describe these ear buds! I could talk about these forever but, I'll widdle it down to just a few facts to influence your decision ;)

Pros:
1. EVERYTHING.
2. 2 subwoofer drivers per bud
3. 1 tweeter per bud.
4. crossover in between them all (No matter what sound level you select they will deliver with zero distortion and acoustical perfection).
5. Industrial strength shielded cord.
6. Solidly built splitter.
7. Gold contacts at ear bud swivels and jack.
8. Ear buds swivel to minimize cord tangle.
9. Replaceable cord.
10. Comfortable in the ear when worn correctly.
11. 6 different ear bud grommets to suit each individual ear hole size and depth.
12. 37dB of insulation. So say a F-18 Super Hornet is landing right above your berthing - you'll feel the vibrations, but won't hear the noise!! HURRAY!

Cons: dun dun dun
1. Price. They are worth every penny and you'll be SOL if you have to switch to a lower standard for some unGodly reason.
2. The cord. Although it's one of the best I've played with, the shielding inside will make for this little loop to form. One must untwist in the was its wrapped. It isn't that big of a pain, but you want to keep it straight so the cord won't get kinked.
3. Swivel ear buds. Fantasmical idea and I wouldn't go back to the other style...EVER. But one should clean it occasionally. (Exceptionally gentle though - theres a mini gold wire centered for the electric to flow through.
4. The around the ear loop doesn't hold it's shape very well. It will re-bend when it goes around your ear but it'd be easier if it just stayed.

All 4 of the cons aren't really cons. Their just nuances of an amazing piece of technical marvel. These are by far the best ear buds I've used and the best personal sound instruments I've heard - in general! Meaning their better then even the over the ear and around your head types."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In my humble opinion, a product is only as good as it's relative competitors.

I bought this to Compare with my Audio-Technica ath-ckr9 & ckr10 because I noticed people were saying the Audio Technicas are clearer and have better bass. Not a bassy headphone, but people are comparing the audio-technicas with the shure se846. They're saying it's better or the closest competitor.

Also, I purchased this because I was really impressed with the se112 which only cost 50 bucks.

I'm Biased:

First I would like to say that I'm biased. I really love the ckr9 and ckr10. With an equalizer, you can get just about any type of sound you want out of these puppies. Whether it's bright, warm, bass heavy, no bass etc.....

Often, I feel like I got duped by the marketing department after purchasing headphones but with the audio technicas, I feel like I robbed Audio Technica because they are way underpriced....

For some crazy reason, the audio technicas really shine and even seem to sound better outside. After souping up my phone, I remember one day I was walking on a main street in Chicago and my music volume was on level 15 out of 75. Before I could think, I said to myself:

""Yeah they sound good now, but lets see how good they sound in a noisy environment."" Then I quickly said to myself, ""duh... you are in a noisy environment"". Needless to say I was amazed....

The only headphones for around the same price as the ckr9/10 I've found that compare to the audio technica's is the Dunno 2000J. Those puppies are really good although I missed the bass, loudness and sound isolation of my Audio Technica's. But if someone said they liked the Dunno's better than the Audio Technicas, I would understand.

Equalizer:
I Always Use An Equalizer... Always!!!!! This is where the iphone was really limited for me. On the contrary, this is where the Audiotechnica's usually outshine all the other brands. They respond extremely well to amplification. Whatever you can through at them, they can handle without getting distorted.

My Review:

I can sum it up by saying:

""Grand Opening, Grand Closing""

First, these things are uncomfortable for my ears. At $500 sorry but comfort should be a given especially when I can get the audio technica's for only $100 to $300.

After realizing I was starting to thin out on top I switch to a nice pair of ear buds. I had crappy earbuds and long periods of time your ears ache from them being in place, this is not the case for these. It took me a while to pick the right one reading the different reviews. but If you like sound, and all the lows and highs. This is a good set to get. I I could afford the nicer one I would have purchased them. but I keep them in there case and dig them out when I want to listen to music they way they should be listen too.

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always had an appreciation for good sound, with headphones I am still learning whats out there, I also have a pair of B&O A8 headphones which I thought were pretty good. When I first came over these on Amazon, I thought that that the price was pretty high so I put them on my wish list for a while and 'thought about it.' Finally the other day I pulled the trigger on them, with the mindset that if these werent the best headphones I had ever used, bar none I would return them. After a couple days use I can say that I am going to keep them, they are unbelievable. (You know how Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear on BBC says ""they are UNBELEIVABLE!"" thats what I mean here)

First and formost these things fit like earplugs, so they block out all other sound. They have great bass, and unbelievable sound clarity. To compare these to my B&O headphones is like comparing a 3 series BMW to a Lamborghini. It is night and day.

Even when I walk down the streets of NYC I feel like I am in my own world. They do take a little getting used to fit wise, and they are not something you can easily remove and put back in. But the sound quality is worth it, especially if you like classical music.

This is my first set of serious headphones, and I am very pleased. I would purchase these agian."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, to the point that I recognize every detail (soundstage, presence, etc.), but I am able to hear imperfections in some of my favorite music. Things that I didn't hear before. And as crazy as it sounds, I love that! Things like hearing a guitarist miss a strum pattern. These bring out the ""human-ness"" of music rather than the mastering. Don't get me wrong, the music still sounds incredible. With a little EQ, I still get the full range that I was hoping for. But being able to hear the music for what it actually is, is very cool to me.

For the past several years, I've been using Shure e4c buds with custom ear molds from Sensaphonics. They were very good, but didn't hold a candle to these. When my e4cs died, I was looking for another less expensive set to get me by, as I was looking at getting another more expensive custom pair (JH Audio). The e4cs spoiled me, so anything less was not going to be acceptable. So I ""settled"" for the Shure SE535s, and was greatly surprised at how I wasn't actually settling at all. And while I'm sure the higher end IEMs are better (JH Audio, Westone, UE, etc.), these are more than satisfactory. I'll definitely be getting custom ear molds for these as well, but have found that the triple-flange sleeves, cut down to fit, work great. I'll be using these for casual listening, as well as IEMs while playing guitar.

The only thing keeping me from giving these 5 stars is the cable. It comes with 2 cables. One is for volume control only, and the other is for volume control and phone accessibility. The one for phone accessibility only works on iPhones, and I have an Android. On top of that, since these already come with an attenuator for volume control, the controls on the cables are unnecessary, and add to unnecessary ""bulk"". I might look into getting some better after-market cables for these.

But overall, great little IEMs."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you love music? Are you a crazy audiophile? Do you love putting headphones on and turning the rest of the world off? Are you absolutely nuts for high-def audio with 320+kbps streams? Then this is the pair of headphones for you ... IF you have the spare cash to spend. Here are some pro's and con's first, and then I'll explain:

Pro's:

* Large selection of ear buds
* Majestic highs, balanced mids and perfect bass.
* If these headphones where a religious icon, they would be the Dalai Lama for their perfect balance and harmony.
* Light weight enough so they don't bother you at all.
* Heavy enough to have a decent feel to them.
* The cord is think and durable.
* The cord is also decently long! Several feet!
* Very good at sound insulation assuming you use a ear piece that fits you.
* The 'detachable' part of the cable (right next to the actual drivers) swivels / rotates so it's super easy to fit over your ear or in any other position.
* Did I mention the sound is absolutely amazing?
* You will be very hard pressed to 'max' out these in-ear headphones.
* Beautifully crisp.

Con's:
* Price. Yeah ... they really are a bit of a hit on the wallet.
* While the cable is rather durable and seems well made, mine is starting to develop a kink near the left driver.
* No cable clip. For a cable this long, is really does need something to clip to yourself ... or maybe it did come with one and I lost it, but currently, when I walk it's a long cable dangling around randomly. Annoying at times (and at other times I'm thankful it's that long).
* If you play any low quality audio, you will REALLY notice it being low quality.

Recommendations:
* Don't 'curl' the cable much (just leave it out on the table or something).
* For best results, use an AMP/DAC. It'll get you better quality audio than your regular headphone plug. And yes, with these headphones there is a significant quality/sound different with and without the DAC.
* For best audio insulation: try the black foamy plugs. Of course make sure to use the right size! Very important! Or if you're more adventurous, try the triple flange plug ... It works wonders once you get used to it.

Explanations about audio quality:

I'm no audio expert, but I can tell you this: if you're currently using something like the iPhone headphones or $40 store bought ones ... you really will notice a huge difference in audio quality with these headphones. That said, they also take a little bit of time getting used to due to their 'natural' sound.

Unlike other headphones which try to over power the bass (yeah, I'm looking at your cheap quality headphones!), the SHURE SE535's are balanced ... balanced almost to a fault. Not too much bass, not too high highs and sprinkled with just a right about of mid-tones.

Nothing will ever be 'washed' out, 'bland' or boring with these. You will hear every nuance, cello, and pin drop in the song all in a nice 'natural' way.

Why do I say 'natural' with quotes? Because at this price range for these types of headphones, this is as close as sitting infront of a real band/orchestra that you'll get. It really is amazingly crisp, clean and un-filtered audio. It's pure.

My conclusion: if you have the cash, get these."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"IMPORTANT: I've owned several pairs of IEMs before these that I've enjoyed (Shure SE310, Etymotic MC5, Sennheiser CX880), but recently decided it was time for an upgrade. When I received these I was incredibly disappointed. The ergonomics were terrible and I couldn't get the isolation I was used to with my other IEMs. None of the provided tips nor my Comply Tx-100 eartips allowed me to get deep insertion, and the great isolation I was used to, due to the large size of these headphones coupled with the nearly 90 degree angle between the body and the eartip. The large olives provided an acceptable solution, UNTIL I ordered and received the Comply P Series eartips. They are longer than any of the provided eartips and longer than the other Comply tips, as well, allowing me to deeply insert the eartips and get an excellent seal and great isolation.

Anyways, once you have a good fit these are stunning little headphones -- vastly outperforming my other IEMS (Shure SE310, Etymotic MC5, Sennheiser CX880) and sounding excellent straight from my iPhone 5. Being a bit of a headphone enthusiast, I can't help but compare them to my other headphones. I also own the Audez'e LCD-2, and the SE535s really can't compete with those, but I would never expect them to given the price and size difference. However, they really do give my Sennheiser HD650s a decent run for their money in terms of sound quality, while having the distinct advantages of being tiny, portable, and easily driven by an iPhone.

For anyone who cares about such things, I'm comparing my SE535s out of my iPhone to my full size phones when plugged into an AMB M^3 headphone amplifier, and fed by an old Parasound DAC 1500. Given that the 535s sound as good as they do completely unamped, they're killer little headphones when you can get a proper seal. Highly recommended.

SUMMARY: If you're unable to get a good seal (the most obvious way to tell is if there isn't much bass), try the Comply P series eartips. They are longer and will essentially guarantee a great fit as long as you're comfortable with something hanging out in your ear canal (and if you're not, stop buying expensive IEMs)."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure Warranty will only honor their 2 year agreement if you purchase from an authorized retailer. I have spoken to their customer service and they said that Amazon is an authorized retailer, but some of the other sellers here are not. That means you'd have to buy right from Amazon themselves.

Take that into consideration when you buy, it looks like several reviewers here have relied on the warranty. Shure says they also won't do repairs on purchases from non-authorized retailers. I will post a link to their authorized retailer list when I can find it.

As for quality, they are nice but I don't think I have a source good enough to allow me to fully appreciate them. I love my 215's."

First off, I was impressed with the packaging of this product... (Steel box) and the supplied accessories (Airplane adapter, volume adjustment adapter, extra ear plugs and cleaner)...Then, we come to the meat of the matter, the headphone set itself. My tunes never.. and I mean NEVER sounded so full, rich, deep, high, vibrant and just plain beautiful. I had to turn the sound down on my iPod touch, which I'm use to playing in the halfway point of the devices volume control... This, of course has the effect of cutting down on the drain on my iPod's battery. This rig is EXACTLY what I needed to be able to enjoy hard core Rock and roll, mellow jazz, rhythm and blues, and old school funk. While the price is not for the squeamish, the rewards for paying that price are well worth it to me... I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good back-beat, driving bass, and bun-kicking vocals...These headphones deliver!"

The sound quality is crisp, neutral and has sound imaging that I get goosebumps over. One piece of advice though before you pull the trigger, get a nice audio player with DAC or amp and you will see what the full potential is. Someone gave this product 3 stars because it does not sound good with his LG G3.....no crap. It's not the best device to deliver audio or power these buds. I enjoy listening out of my Fiio X1 or my iP6. Yeah believe it or not, lossless music sounds almost as good through my iP6 as my X1. My life pretty much changed the minute I started using these headphones and I will never go back to Beats/Bose/[insert new popular brand here].

Buy it, there will be no regrets."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned Shure ear buds forever. My last one was the SE530, which I thought was pretty good. I've also bought Ultimate Ears 10 Pro earphones, which was great for low ranges but was missing the highs. I just put on the SE535 which arrived today. My music has never sounded better. I listen to a lot of jazz, classical, and rock. The SE535s has remarkable fidelity; I'm hearing details I did not catch before. At least for my ear, and I would consider myself an average audiophile, the SE535s are the best in-ear phones I've heard. Pricey, but because I now consume 90% of my music through my iPod, these are most definitely worth it."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure 535 earphones about a month ago and the total verdict is a full page of +'s. The sound is amazing (after having custom ear molds made....My ears are weird....difficult fit with standard earphones has always plagued me). The bass is deep, smooth and balanced. The mids and highs are crisp and sweet with no coloring. One of the most amazing things about these earphones is the effect that their near perfect attack of a cymbal or drums or anything has on the listening experience. I'm not an expert..just a guy who loves good sound and these are the first earphones I would rate with Grado PS1000 or Sennheiser HD800's and at less than a third their cost. If you love music and need excellent earphones I cannot recommend the Shure 535's more highly. OH ...and to the point of build quality, I simply don't understand statements by others that criticize the 535's build quality. I find them to be excellent in this regard. They feature sturdy replaceable cables in case yours become damaged with use and they are in every way solidly built as far as I can see."

4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They blew me away. Do not regret my purchase.
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most people are looking for assurances that the reviewer of a product is qualified, so allow me to indulge briefly: I'm a lifelong musician, sound engineer, and headphone enthusiast/general audiophile. I love music not only for the artistry and quality of arrangement, musicianship, etc, but also for the beauty of sound that comes from the recording/mastering process, ultimately delivered through your speakers or headphones.

The first thing most listeners will notice with the 535's is their phenomenal mid-range response, which is largely out of style in most of today's popular (read: crap) audio products. The tight, clean bass is delightfully present in the mix without clouding over other ranges. The treble is bright and organic, not harsh and overpowering. The improved bass response, build design, and crossover sets these apart from earlier and lower models (I actually did an A/B test with the 425s vs 535s since I own both - the 535s won by a huge margin). I love cranking these puppies up...it feels like the music is emanating FROM MY BRAIN. Make sure you get a good seal on the 535's and they will change your life. Boom.

I have been very loyal to Shure for the past 5 years or so for their honest sound, quality builds, and great customer service. I had the E4G's and SE425s for several years, and when the cord broke on the former pair, they shipped me a brand new pair without question.

Bottom line: these aren't for ""pop"" audio listeners looking for destructively rumbling bass and over-cranked, shimmery highs. Try Bose, you will be more happy with the inaccurate replication of the music. For those seeking full, powerful, honest sound with a great build and innovative features, buy these and don't look back."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised how good sound it was for vocal, it feels like the singers are whispering at me. However, that's not a only genre I listen.
I listen lots of orchestra, instr. included music, new era, heavy base, progressive music as well.

I guess giving you specific example would make more sense.
I am currently really into ""Pianoguys"". One of their songs: ""What makes you beautiful"" , there is low-tone piano sounds at the beinning 0:00~0:13.
When I listen that song with this, the sound just get shattered with static sounds, and it was just total-failure.

And there are also constant-static sounds when you don't listen anything.
And the design, although it looks fancy and phenomenal, I do see that it will break quickly unless you put extra care on it.

So I went for Atomic Floyd Superdarts Titanium, which has superior durability.

However, I do see that this will suit for some specific people, but it wasn't just for me.

But I see this will definitely satisfy for some certain people. So my suggestion is, try it first if you can.

And if you read thru other reviews, people often complain about the durability issues. This was just no-no for me.

Any recommendation/suggestions/comments are welcomed."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is utterly amazing. Exercising in the wee hours of every morning with these in my ears feels like an indulgence, exactly the polar opposite of the boredom I had previously. BUT, my second pair in less than two years seems already to be biting the dust. As someone else wrote, ""it was not the cable itself but the input point on the ear phone! "" For my first pair, this happened slightly after the one-year warranty had expired (goodbye $415!). For my second pair, the warranty is 2 years, so presumably I can get a replacement, but what a pain after only 6 months to have to forego my earbuds to wait for a replacement. Sound quality is 6, but having experienced the exact same problem twice, Shure quality control deserves from me at best a score of 1/2, which upon rounding the average gives 3 stars. To Shure: ""Fool me twice, shame on you, but fool me thrice, shame on me."" For me, there will not be a thrice. You've lost a customer who had dearly loved your product."

0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been listening to headphones of many different kinds for many years, from ancient AKGs to the amazing Sennheiser 800's. Maybe I've been spoiled by superior headphones ( the best of which for me are Sennheiser HD 800, Sennheiser HD 650, Ultrasone Edition 8 and even Grado SR-1 ), but these Shure headphones are very disappointing. The midrange is actually quite good and the top end isn't bad. The trouble is with the bass. They tell you that the bottom end is very good if you get a decent fit. That certainly is not my experience. The bottom is, at best, barely satisfactory when compared to the first rate headphones I mentioned. There are many headphones that are much better for the price. I very much regret this purchase and would not recommend them unless you absolutely need an in-ear set of cans - in which case this may be the best available outside of the much more expensive customs."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Insanely Great headphones. The Bass does lack when you first listen to them, but stay with it for a few songs and the unyielding clarity in all ranges makes these an obvious choice for all you audiophiles. It took a long time of research and reading to finally choose these and I could not be happier I did. They do not crackle distort or lose clarity with volume. I am a Runner so having a great sound for many miles is so important to me. The amount of noise suppression these have makes them a great choice as you already can't hear the world around you with no music playing. They make a completely isolated personal concert hall in which you can live. They are really comfortable, secure fit even with sweat. They require regular cleaning. The smallest amount of water, dirt, ear gross, etc will completely disrupt the sound and make you think they are broken. They do however have a nice filter to prevent any dirt, grime, or moisture from entering the actual bud and ruining it. Buy em, don't wait, buy em."

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I recieved these just about 4 months ago and the left ear connector has always been touchy as far as when I would move my head around at all it would crackle. Tried to switch wires to the opposite ear pieces but the left one still has the poor contact and crackling when moving your head around. It has always had a looser conection than the right to the point of worring about it falling off when hanging around my neck waiting to get to 10,000 feet(air travel). Well it happened, left ear piece is gone, 500 bucks down the drain. Never again. Time to find out just how good customer support is with Shure. Incredible sound but beware of the connectors."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"l had a pair of the SE530's and the sound was unmatched for IEMs that I'd tried up until that point. When I saw the newer 535s come out with the detachable cables I thought that was perfect since I wear them a lot and it would make replacing them a lot cheaper should the need arise.

First the reason for the 1 star. The detachable cables lead to significant problems. The fact that they're not a permanent connection means they lose contact between the cable and the ear piece. When you lose contact, obviously, you lose sound. The left and right channels cut in and out continuously unless I keep my head and body perfectly still. If I'm on the bus the jostling means I can't listen to a single song without frequent cuts. If I'm at my desk and I turn my head ever so slightly to look from my main monitor to the monitor to the right, same thing.

The sound quality is great. If these were solid and permanent connections, like my previous pair, I'm sure I'd have nothing bad to say. But what good is the quality if it cuts out? That's worse in a lot of ways.

Search online (head-fi dot org in particular) and you'll find copious reports of the same problem. I thought I'd just put up with it and I did for a long while but I'm just sick of it now. Unfortunately I'm past my warranty. I tried contacting Shure customer support and they just gave me the run around so I have no idea if they'll replace them. It's clearly a manufacturing/design flaw and should be a no-questions asked replacement. Damned if they'll tell me that.

I even bought high quality after-market cables and while that improved the sound quality tremendously and the cutting out problems a little bit it did not solve the problem.

I wish I could say order these but at this price, with the high probability for having the same problem, I'd say move on to another company.

-- UPDATE 9/30 --
I've taken to pulling the buds off the cables and cleaning both the male and female parts of the connection with alcohol every couple of days. This seems to improve the consistency of contact between the cable and buds. Still not perfect, but much better. I'm bumping up to 2 stars since it's more bearable but, still, for something of this price that's hardly acceptable.

-- UPDATE 10/10 --
Well, with the increase in removing the buds to clean the connections I guess it was inevitable. The cables have a single wire centered in the connection end. The buds have a ""tube"" that the cable slides into. The tube is actually two pieces, two half-pipes, if you will. Well, after cleaning just a few minutes ago I reinserted the cable and gently snapped it into place. Not so quick! Something happened and it wouldn't click into place. I looked inside and one of the half-pipes was broken away.

At present I'm looking into getting custom IEMs. If I'm going to spend a lot of money I may as well get something exceptional. Right now I'm looking at JH Audio JH13. Considerably more expensive but generally rated higher for sound quality and build quality."

Finally $450 is too much money for (not perfect Earphone), I wish I didn't buy it.."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones.

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning: if you are a drummer or use these to exercise, they WILL break quickly - as the swivel design allows a gap between the cable and IEMs which cause sweat or liquid to seep in. The design is flawed. The first pair broke in less than 2 weeks, second pair broke in less than 3 days of usage. Move on to JH or something better without this awful swivel design unless you only use for recreational use (but who would do that with a pair of $500 IEMs)?"

""The sound is louder than the average earphones but there's a lack of bass
Clumsy adjustment on the ear.
I do prefer my B&W/Bose/Sennheiser cheaper earphones.
It's not worth $400""

However I must change these statements after 4 months, because the sound of the earphones changed due to the so called BURN IN or BROKE IN...These expressions really do make a lot of difference and they mean that your headphones and your earphones need some time of effective use to deliver the sound that you expect from them.
That is what happened to my SE 535...
100 hours of intensive listening and the bass shows up...the sound pressure is magnificent now....the sound stage unique !!!
Considering that it's an earphone it's amazing how involving the music comes into your ears, with deep bass, clear mids and highs, and a lot of resolution....you get a real connection to the music.
The sound is much higher than you can bear if you plug it to your Ipod or your pc.
I changed the plugs to a minor size, thar comes in the phones package, and got a better fit in my ears."

3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had waited for a while until I needed to replace my Shure SE530 earbuds, which I think is an incredible earbud. I realized the new Shure SE535 earbuds had a detachable cable, so I ordered the new earbuds with the greatest of expectations. A word to the wise. The new Shure SE535 earbuds have a new design from the previous model, Shure SE530. The cable is detachable, however the angle of wiring from the casing is different and causes a major problem with people like me who have an interferance with a ridge of ear cartilage that does not provide a seal due to the change in design. If you look at images of the new Shure SE535 earbuds you'll realize the major difference. I cannot use the new model because of the change. I was very dissapointed when I realized the difference. I was surprised that there wasn't more complaints concerning the change. You only have the option of returning the item or having earmolds built for the earbuds. Be warned if you buy these earbuds from a merchant other than Amazon, you'll be hit with a ridiculous restocking fee which will frustrate you into never using an outside merchant again to save a little money. Do your research."

These were a good balance between value and cost. The base-quality could be a little more rich i.e. I listen to a lot of trance, etc. (the mids and highs are great e.g. you will hear stuff in your music you have never heard before). Most importantly, this allows me to tune-out the world and focus on graft. ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS i.e. I could not live without these and they have become completely indispensable to me."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones sound AMAZING! They are exactly what I would expect to hear after paying $500. But, (and it's a big ""But"") after using these for slightly over one month the supposed durable cable connector (the part that connects to the ear phone itself) became loose distorting and cutting off sound every time I moved the cable. I figured it was just the cable so I paid an additional $40 for a replacement cable, and quickly discovered it was not the cable itself but the input point on the ear phone! Now I have to send them back to Shure for repair! This in my opinion is simply unacceptable for a pair of $500 earphones hence the 2 star rating! And just a caveat, I in no way mistreated the earphones. They were kept in the case (the case is poor quality btw) when not in use, and were handled exactly as instructed! So, I recommend if you buy these, make sure the connection is not loose, and wiggle the cable while music is playing to make sure there is no break in sound! If so send them back immediately or you'll be stuck having to deal with Shure directly!

7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's something to the saying ""You only know what you know."". Before my purchase of the Shure SE535-CL, the best earbuds I'd owned were the Bose Noise Cancelling QC20i models, which I can not live without the noise cancellation feature, because I travel a lot for business. I've always read in reviews where pure audiophile types were always bashing Bose earphone products for there manufactured synthetic sound, which for me was the best I'd heard, so I always took it with a grain of salt. Curious, I recently purchased the Shure SE535s, because you only live once and I wanted to at least put the notion to rest and support my suspicion that some people are too finicky.

Well I've got to eat some crow, because as most have attested to, when you try the Shure SE530 or SE535 on for the first time, you hear things in music you never heard before with other earbuds. I have to say though, when I first tried them on out of the box, I was immediately going to send them back, because when I first tried them on with the medium sized black foam ear pieces, I did not get a good seal. I tried on various other ear pieces with crappy results also, until I tried on the large sized black memory foam ear pieces, which sealed perfectly and to my surprise actually cancelled more noise than the active noise cancelling function of the Bose QC20i, albeit, a bit less comfortable than the Bose.

The sound quality is impeccable and well worth the money! When I move up in the world, maybe one day I'll get a chance to try out the SE846 series, but I know what I know now and the Shure SE535s are the best I've owned and heard so far. It's crazy how the technology and quality for a pair of earbuds have stood the test of time. This model has been out for over six years and is a testament to the quality that goes into the research and innovation at Shure!! Don't hesitate, get these! If you don't like them, I'm sure you did not get a proper fitting with the proper ear piece. Kudos Shure!! I'm a new fan!"
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried multiple in-ear monitors including Westone 20, 40 and 50. The Shure 535 was the best to my ears. It is a matter of taste but the Shure 535 was the most neutral without exaggerating either end of the spectrum. Many ear phones often push the bass fairly heavily and sound great at first but are often masking more subtle details. The Shure has a good sound stage. The fit is fantastic and they can be worn for long periods of time. They are amazing in the isolation from noise. I recommended them without hesitation. The Shure 435 is nice but is rather thin in the lower ranges and are not as satisfying."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having my SE-315s lose sound in the right ear I wasn't sure whether to repair or replace them. In the end I did both. Shure have a very good warranty program and even though my 315s were themselves replacements from a previous repair (E3Cs), they completely replaced again them after 18 months of use and all I had to pay for was the cost of shipping them to Shure.

In the meantime though I bought the 535s and also got some custom sleeves made by Sensaphonics. The 535s blew me away with how good they are. Even with standard sleeves they produce so much more power than the 315s (which I now have back from repair), and the bass is so much tighter and more defined. Listening to some of my best recorded tracks (Peter White - Perfect Moment SACD, Fourplay-Fourplay DVD Audio) is just heaven on a stick with these. The custom sleeves make a great pair of headphones even better, although be warned they are quite temperamental and it took quite a few tries to insert them so that I didn't end up with the sound tubes blocked. Putting them in and out of your ears is also a major undertaking but once in you're in for a real treat.

Sad to say the 315s sit in the drawer now as they just sound flat and dead by comparison. Even my over the ear HD-650s can't compete with the 535s. It just makes me wonder how good the SE-846s are ... maybe one day ..."

The ""plug"" style is the only ones i have found on the market that stay in during a workout. And they block the noise of the helicopters while i am working on the tarmac. But in Iraq heat, your ears will sweat. But not as much as over the ear headphones will. And at over 160 degrees F. with reflection off the aircraft, you cannot help to sweat. Best purchase of a headphones yet. no broken wires after over a year of hard use. loud as hell too. They are even better ones out there, but they cost $1,000! I will stick with these. After almost two years of daily use the one plug ripped. easy replacement though. I cannot recommend these enough. My wife tried them after just listening to the ones that come with her phone and her remark was ""oh my god! I did not know there was this much base in this song!"" enough said."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 535's are a near perfect earbud for most people. They offer a high quality sound at all frequencies, good bass reproduction and a good fit. The high sensitivity is a nice feature as well to allow people on their phones to conserve a little more battery. The 535's also have a replaceable cord in the event that it wears out, which at some point they all do.

How I use them:

Primarily for me, these are used at work in my cube and at the gym. They fit comfortably, but I did south out the fitting to a three tier silicone tip made by Etymotic. I have narrow ear canals so the drivers need to be small to fit right and seal correctly and the foam tips don't do it for me. I'm giving these 4 stars for the robustness off the product. The two things they begin to act up with are high heat and moisture. If I'm doing cardio at the gym, these can't be worn. The sweat accumulates in the filter and severely attenuates the signal. If you like the sauna, even though it's dry, the heat can destroy some if the more delicate parts in the driver. For those days I rely on an old pair of Etymotics that didn't cost me much. On the days I lift, I don't sweat nearly as much and these work great. They give a lot of isolation for the surroundings, stay in place and I can wear the cord on the inside of my shirt so it's not in the way. Overall these are very good and I would recommend them as long as your not going to push the limits."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has a stellar reputation within the music community. Very few musicians are not aware of their awesome mics and mixers. I own no less than 3 mics and 2 portable mixers. That is why I had zero reservations getting these. Shure would simply not offer these unless they were fantastic, right?

When I first put the Shure SE 535s in, I was underwhelmed. The sound was on the tinny side and the bass was weak. No matter which (included) ear buds I used ( and Shure includes many) nothing seemed to help. I was about to return them when I read some of the reviews on Amazon. How could so many people rave about this and yet they sounded so bad? It is not like the construction is cheap or the design is lagging. On the contrary, the construction and design are top notch, they are beautiful. Which makes it all the more painful that they sounded so cheap and hollow. Maybe it was my overly high expectations? I own many high-end reference quality head phones, how could an IEM come close? Other than my iPhone factory ear units, I do not own any other IEM's.

Then I saw one review in which the person said that ""not everybody's ears will fit the vast array of ear buds Shure supplies, and if you are one of these people - it will sound like s***."" He recommended a few other aftermarket ear bud companies. These companies offer a crazy array of diameters and - more importantly - LENGTHS.

I found one that fits and was super comfortable. Unlike the Shure supplied units, this one went far deeper into my ear. I was listing to some Jazz ""In the element"" by Emmet Cohen"" at the time and.... WOW!!!! Like a heavenly chorus, I heard the full sound for the first time. I quickly pulled out some Mozart, and Zepp., and it just got better. Clear, reference quality, sound with perfect mids and thick clean bass. Just what I expected - a professional reference sound instrument to sound like. I highly - highly recommend, but make sure your ear buds allow the IEM to go far enough into your ears so you can hear the full sound.

One last point. Some reviewers on Amazon thought the cord was a little thick. This is totally a Shure thing. These are designed to take abuse and keep working. That is what a professional music product is all about. After 3 years of very hard use ( and abuse) they are still in perfect condition. Thanks Shure!!!!!!!!!

***Thanks Ken S for your feedback on this review*** The after market foam tips I use are the Comply Professional P-100. I got the mix pack so I could try S M L. These guys clearly know what they are doing. There ear tips are custom made for most IEM. So they fit and work perfectly. Comply's have 3 great features: 1) The P-100 go go deeper into the ear for better bass. 2) The foam softens up as it reaches body temp and seals the ear canal (again for better sound). This is by far the quietest tips I have ever tried. 3) As it softens with your body heat, the foam becomes so compliant that you forget they are there ( except for the fact you can't hear anything) :-)"
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"$500 for this piece of scrap? You can't be serious. I'm absolutely furious with the design and product quality. My first time with the series and I honestly dislike it. Really hard to get into your ears because of its design and the quality is cheap for the price you pay. Cheap materials like hard plastic. What's really upsetting is the design, it's flawed, bound to break within a year or less(2 years at most). You can only go so far with warranty. Just unbelievable, I can't believe anyone would think this is a good idea. I wanna meet the person who designed this and uppercut their jaw for this frustrating buy. Sure, the sound is good... but for the money? Better options. $500, I feel like a f###### idiot. Buyers beware, not worth the price in my perspective."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a hardcore audiophile but that I do enjoy listening to music and travel quite a bit for work and am constantly on the hunt for new IEM's and headphones to use when traveling on planes/etc. That being said, I'd probably describe myself more as an enthusiast rather than a hardcore audiophile.

I was in the market for some high end IEM's and was choosing between the Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad HiDef MicroDrivers, Crystal Clear and Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black). I was looking to upgrade from my Shure SE535-CL Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable (Clear) and Westone UM 3X In-Ear Musician's Monitor, Universal Fit Earphone with Removable Cable, Clear, 79292 (I have the RC removable cable version of the UM3x's). Anyway, I ended up buying the SE846's and found a pair of used IE800's on another site so now I have all four of these IEM's and plan on selling the SE535's and UM3x's. I know I really don't need two sets of IEM's but with the SE846 and IE800 I love them both so much that I don't really want to sacrifice one or the other. In any case, since I have all four of them now I thought it'd be helpful to some of you out there who may want to know a bit more about these at least in terms of how I rank them.

I'll be ranking them using the following criteria (which I adapted from a well known user on head-fi) on a scale from 1-10 each:

Bundled Accessories - Which ones come with the best and most comprehensive list of accessories
Build Quality - How well I feel they will hold up over time
Isolation - How well they block out ambient noise
Microphonics - How much cable noise you hear when moving around
Comfort - How comfortable each one are after wearing for extended use (over an hour on plane for example)
Sound - This is a bit subjective as all people tend to hear details differently in the sound so I'll do my best to describe why I rank them the way I do
Value - For the money which one is best?

::Shure SE846:: - 65/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9.5/10 - Shure really didn't leave anything out when they put this package together. It comes with a large plastic case like a pelican case as well as a zippered case. It also comes with a plethora of tips and most interestingly a set of 2 additional tubes that can be inserted in to the IEM's that change the sound of the SE846's. I opted to stay with the pre-installed neutral tubes. The only thing that would have been nice is if they included an iPhone/Android compatible cable. At the price they are asking it should be a throw in...

::Build Quality::
10/10 - All plastic with the exception of the ear nozzle which is metal. From what I hear this is the most susceptible part to break so it's nice they changed them to metal from the previous generations plastic nozzles.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pair, Small) with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
8.5/10 - These are LARGE IEM's. With everything packed in to the SE846's I suppose you could say that they are small but compared to the SE535's these are noticeably larger and if you have smaller ears you may have some comfort issues with these. I've found that I can wear these for extended periods of use but find myself adjusting them from time to time depending on how much I am moving around.

::Sound::
10/10 - The sub bass is incredible in these little IEM's. I thought I could hear bass in some of my other IEM's but these take it to another level with the low frequencies it can go down to. The bass is there and not overwhelming and the highs are crisp and clear. I find the soundstage to be wide on these but not as wide as the Sennheiser IE800's. Overall, the sound on these is excellent! Also worth noting is the VERY low impedance of only 9 ohms! This means that they can easily be driven from mobile devices and get good volume without having to turn it all the way up!

::Value::
8/10 - At the price they ask for these, I can't say that they are the best value but they are some seriously great sounding IEM's.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE846's seem to be an evolutionary step in a long line of IEM's. I've had many Shure's dating back to the e2c's, SE425's, SE535's and now the SE846's. As time progressed and Shure refined and improved their products I've been with them along for the ride and I'm happy to say that the SE846's have many welcome evolutionary steps above and beyond what they've done before. The sub bass is amazing in an IEM and the other improvements like the metal nozzles and removable tubes to change the sound are great. Coming from their previous flagships, the SE535's, I can see that they've put a lot of thought and effort in to these and can say that the higher price is fully justified... if only they'd redesigned the iPhone compatible cable and included it with them too! Honestly, though, that's the ONLY downside I see in these IEM's is that they don't include an iPhone compatible cable like their competitors. Other than that, these are some of the best IEM's on the market today and I highly recommend them.

::Sennheiser IE800:: - 60/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9/10 - Not a lot comes with these but what it does come with is REALLY nice. The case is by far one of the best cases I've ever used for IEM's. The case has a cutout inside the case to put them in and the cable wraps around the case nicely so you never have to deal with tangled cords. The IE800's come with a set of replaceable silicone tips that can be cleaned and reused by just running them under the sink with some soap and water... NICE! The only thing as with all of these is that at the price they ask for them they should include an iPhone/Android compatible cable. The other thing you should know is that the tips are proprietary so there are no officially documented comply tips that will work but I hear that some of the comply tips will work.

::Build Quality::
10/10 - Ceramic housings and a kevlar cable... no other IEM on the market can say that as far as I know... built like a tank

::Isolation::
8/10 - The bundled silicone tips do an adequate job of blocking ambient noise but they aren't going to block noise as well as others.

::Microphonics::
5/10 - By far the worst microphonics I've heard out of an IEM. Try not to move much when using these... I think it's mostly due to the downward position of the IE800's when inserted in to your ears. If you're lucky enough to be able to wrap the cord around your ear so you can use them as over ear IEM's then do it. It vastly improves the microphics of the cable. Unfortunately it's a bit uncomfortable when I wear them this way as the upper part of the cable past the Y is only about 9.5 inches.

::Comfort::
10/10 - These are so small and light that they really disappear when you insert them in to your ears. I find that I can wear these for extended periods with ZERO problems. They may be the most comfortable IEM's I've had to date.

::Sound::
10/10 - The frequency response on these IEM's is really really nice! It's amazing you can get such rich sound out of a single driver IEM. I was skeptical at first since I'm used to multiple driver IEM's but after hearing these I can say that I'm convinced! I do feel that the mids are more pronounced on these than the SE846's which is nice for certain types of music. The bass is also good on these IEM's... Overall it's a nice and rich full sounding IEM. It's worth noting here that the designer of the acclaimed $1500 Sennheiser HD800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Premiere Headphone also designed these... I've never heard the HD800's but I've read that the IE800's are like mini HD800's. Also, the low impedance of 16 ohms means that it can be driven relatively easily by mobile devices. On my iPhone I can get more than adequate volume from these without having to turn it up too much.

::Value::
8/10 - Yes they are expensive but they sound great and are extremely comfortable to wear.

::CONCLUSION::
These are great little IEM's and I mean little! I'm wearing these right now going on over an hour with them on at my desk and I don't feel any fatigue at all... and the sound!! The sound is nice and crisp with good bass response and instrument separation despite being driven only by a single driver. Although the Shure SE846's do have some more bass response in the low low end, sound wise I still put these on the same level for it's overall richness and sound. Great IEM's and highly recommended!!

::Shure SE535:: - 60.5/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
8/10 - Comes with a case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use... The bundled accessories are acceptable for an IEM in this price range but I feel like they could have included a bit more like an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These are fairly light IEM's and feel great in the ear and I have had no issues with them wearing them for extended periods.

::Sound::
8/10 - Nice and crisp highs and mids! The bass lacks a bit when compared to the Westone UM3x's and of course when compared to the Shure SE846's it will be lacking too but nonetheless if you're more in to mids and highs then you can't go wrong with these. These are some nice and neutral IEM's IMHO. These impedance on these is 36 ohms which means that it can be driven from most mobile devices without the need for much amplification.

::Value::
8.5/10 - If you're in the market for a pair of neutral IEM's these are the ones to go with.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE535's have now been eclipsed by the SE846's but not everyone will want to spend that kind of $$ on the SE846's. At their price the SE535's are still a tremendous IEM that has a great neutral sound with good mids and highs but lacking a bit in the bass department. They are still enjoyable to listen to and are actually more comfortable (to me) than the SE846's due to their smaller design. Recommended for those looking for a really good, neutral IEM.

::Westone UM3x RC:: - 63/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
7/10 Comes with the standard case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use. The zippered case is nice and compact but I feel like they should have also included their Westone Monitor Vault - Smoke Gray for them as well. Also, like all of these, they should include an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
10/10 - The Westone Epic cable is by far the best I've used in terms of microphonics. The cable is thin and light so it really causes no issues in this regard.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These feel about the same to me in ear as the Shure SE535's... great for extended use.

::Sound::
9/10 - The mids and highs on these IEM's are crisp and clear but these also pack a punch when it comes to bass. They don't pack as much punch as say the Shure SE846's or even the Sennheiser IE800's but at this price point they are very nice full sounding IEM's. These IEM's have an impedance of 56 ohms... they can be driven from mobile devices but you'll definitely find yourself turning it up a bit.

::Value::
10/10 - For the price I feel that these are a very good value... good sound, good comfort, and good price!

::CONCLUSION::
I initially bought the UM3x's on a whim at the airport mostly because I craved something with a bit more low end bass over the SE535's... this was of course before the SE846's came out and the Sennheiser IE800's... nonetheless, after auditioning these I bought them on the spot. The highs and mids sound good (not as good as the Shure SE535's but good enough for me) and these IEM's do provide the bass response that I was looking for that the SE535's were lacking. They're warmer sounding to me than the SE535's and more fun because of it. Depending on my mood (before I got the SE846's and IE800's) I'd switch between the SE535's and UM3x's. I recommend these highly!

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see from above these are ALL really nice IEM's and for various reasons I've ranked them all very highly.

HIGH OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you have the money definitely go for the Shure SE846's or Sennheiser IE800's... They are both well worth the money IMO. The SE846's may be better for those of you on the go a lot (because of the low impedance and low microphonics in the cable) while the IE800's are probably better suited for at home use or for people who won't be moving around much (due to the microphonics issue).

LOWER OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you're budget is on the lower end of the high end IEM market then I have no hesitation in recommending either the Westone UM3x RC's or Shure SE535's... the difference between those is mostly in the sound signature. The SE535's are more neutral sounding to me while the UM3x's have a bit more umph when it comes to bass response.

It should be noted that Westone has recently released the Westone UM Pro 30 Smoke (Universal Monitor Earphones) and Westone UM Pro 20 High Performance Dual Driver in-ear Headphone of which I auditioned both at a store... These would definitely both be worth looking in to... the accessory bundles alone would be worth it over the competition. They come with a regular cable and iPhone/Android compatible cable and a nice plastic pelican case-like case. My wife got the UM Pro 20's and she's very happy with them and uses them every day."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a life long techie, most things don't amaze me. I recently started to do indepth research about the best in ear headphones money could buy. All indications pointed to the Shure se535 headphones. At $500.00 I had serious doubts. I added up all the money I've spent over the years on ok headphones and it way exceded $500 so I decided to take the plunge. All I can say is holy s***! How is it possible that this sound quality could come out of a 1/16"" tube? If you close your eyes it sounds like you are sitting with the orchestra. I hear things I've never heard before. I find it hard to believe it could get any better. Also, these are very comfortable (after many ear tip changes). I opted for the iPhone wire which does not have the molded around ear wire. I prefer not to put them around my ears. If you use a shirt clip to take the tension off the wire, that works just fine. I'm surprised Shure does not supply that option.

I take good care of my stuff and I expect to have these for many years to come (for $500 plus, I hope so). I guess you can chalk this experience up to, you get what you pay for."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply the best earphones/IEM I have tried. Neutral, great bass response but not bassheadpunchy, VERY detailed sound stage, comfortable when you know how to fit them in to your ear. Takes a few tries but when in I forget them. Cable attachable and that is great. But the sound is most important and it reflects exactly what you put in. So good quality music ir reproduced 100% accurate. Used to have a pair of BOSE and they sound good to but not realistic. Put the 535 in, close your eyes and you actually are on row 3 in front of the band!

I use them for jazz, rock and classic. Maybe not so good if you need a lot of artificial bass. I don't (anymore)."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I Love these earbuds. I have had them for about 6 years at this point. I had used several of the previous models, and had them wear in some way or another for me. These are modular, so I can replace the part that is a problem without losing the whole pair.

First of they sound really good. I have used a number of different models, of earbuds in the $100+ range, and these have been my favorite. They don't have over hyped bass, so some people may not enjoy them. I have used them for In-Ear-Monitors, and as my standard listening vehicle. I really like the accuracy of these, they provide a full range sound, and I have even used them in some mixing situations when nothing else was available.

They offer a number of different inserts so you can get a comfortable find. Keep in mind that not all earbuds work for all people. Ears are as unique as fingerprints, and because of these may not work for some people. I have relatively small ears, and the small foam inserts work well for me. There are a few silicone options available as well, if that's your thing. The cable have a harder sleeve by the earbuds which allows you to train the cable to your ears. It can take a little time, but once you do it, they stay for the life of the cable.

Cable durability can an issue, and I have run into problems getting the earbuds to release from the cable (I actually broke one due to an extra firm connection). I have had to send these in twice, which is a little annoying, but the warranty was honored by Shure and they sent me back brand new replacements (one time outside of warranty, due connection breaking them issue). The last time they sent them back, they included a soft case which has kept them in far better shape. I had been keeping them in my pocket, and keeping them away from all the other stuff has kept them in pretty good condition. The last time I sent them in was over two years ago, and while i have replaced the cable to a newer one that can fit into my phone case, I haven't had problems with them.

The only reason I have given these a 4 star rating is because I have had to send them in for service, and because of the price. I got a very good deal on mine through my job, but at full retail I don't feel like they are made for the general public who are used to spending $20-$50 on a set of earbuds.

When these finally bite the bullet beyond me being able to get replacements at a reasonable price from Shure, I'm not sure what model I'll end up going with, but I definitely wouldn't rule out purchasing these again."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE535 are simply amazing. As they should be fore the price. Are they over priced? Of course they are it's just a pair of headphones right? Consider this when buying them how often do you listen to music on your headphones? 5, 8, 10+ hours per day? if you are dedicating that much of your life to a task in my opinion the price may be a little more justified. If it's a quality product and you are going to spend a lot of time every day of your life using it then putting a lot of money on that product doesn't sting as much this is just the way I see it. If your buying a pair of headphones to toss in the Gym bag and use while your working out look elsewhere.

I'm a networking engineer and spend a good part of my day either behind a desk or in a noisy data center with thousands of servers. I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile and have own and still own several pairs of high end headphones. I've owned the Bose IE series 1 2 and the MIE they're great for acoustic & live music it sounds like you are sitting beside the stage they're comfortable but the fail in some of the other everyday music listening habits I have such as Rock, Heavy rock and rap. The bose headphones bottom out on bass so I got a pair of beats the Urbeats they were OK more powerful bass and could produce a lower thump than the Bose but the overall sound quality was not on par with the Bose. I then tried the Beats Tour & Power Beats.
I liked these, the same powerful teeth rattling low end thump but the highs and mids were present as well still maybe not quite the overall sound quality of Bose for some music I think on avg I used these more just because they did a much better job isolating the sound and producing a powerful good quality sound. I also own several on the ear headphones a pair of Bose, Turtle Beach and 2 pair of Razer the Tiamat 7.1 and Razer megalodon After a LONG time researching and reading reviews looking at spec sheet comparisons to what I already owned I talked myself into purchasing a pair of these and I'm glad that I did. The sound quality is simply amazing they sound like no earphones you've ever had in your ears hands down. A large over the head extreme studio monitor headset *might* have them beat in some departments but it wouldn't be by much and you aren't sitting at a desk or walking around all day wearing one of those... They're comfortable as the bose IE series you can easily wear these all day long with no issues. The bass is there when you want it a good EQ like viper can make them produce the same low end thump that any beats produce only cleaner it's not a loud drowned out thump it's a powerful clean bass hit and you can feel it going down your spine it's incredible. With most sound isolating headphones when you are running you may hear yourself breathing or the sound of your feet pounding the ground as you run I don't get that with these. They fit in a way that you can still hear the outside world when the music isn't playing but when it is that's all you hear. Even in the noisy data center at lower listening volumes the servers don't intrude on the music all I hear is the song.

The price might be justified to some but I think they're still a bit over priced. for $500 I'd like to see the mobile headphone wire /w mic included in the box and the box is metal while that's cool it's a waste of money and you are paying for it. You won't be storing these in the box after you open them so what's the point?

in the end If you are willing to spend this kind of money on a pair of headsets I would recommend them you won't be disappointed."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I personally did not like them. They sound really good but I just couldn't justify spending that much money. I thought they would provide me with a listening experience like I had never heard. They didn't stay in my ears that well either.
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a happy 215 user, I was reluctant to spring for the 535s. Could they really be enough of an improvement to justify the cost?

After a week with them, my answer is an unqualified yes.

I am an audiophile, and my music listening is based in large part in listening for the subtleties. The 535s do not disappoint. The basses are SO much tighter. (The engineer in me would say rise-time is faster.) I can honestly say I never expected this kind of bass response from an in-the-ear device. It seriously seems to defy physics.

Trebles are equally impressive to me. There is a subtle discrimination of high frequencies that on the 215s kind of ran together.

Mid-range to me is, well, typical mid-range. I've never listened much to that range of frequencies, but it is as good as any I've heard.

I'm very happy with them and look forward to listening as I never have."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the headphones sound stage, crisp and clear instruments and fit. The only reason I took a star away was because of its price and discomfort of the loop around the ear when moving around with the earphones in. The bendable plastic can irritate some listeners, but I can't say for all. The fit is great however. Owning the Triple Fi-10, I couldn't justify its price at 4 times, as I couldn't hear that major difference after switching through it several times. If you need an upgrade, may be worth trying, but make sure you're comfortable with it before you settle as it is quite a big investment."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bounced around to quite a few brands out there and while the costs of these are hard to justify, from a audio point of view, there is no downgrading possible once you've spent some time with these.

I tried some of the higher end etymotics thruout the years and even had a lesser shure pair, eventually over time in the hunt for a supreme audio experience I ended up with a 500 series shure and for me, the difference was night and day. As small inovations were made within the 500 series, I adopted an upgrade or two mostly due to wear and tear on the device(lost a pair once)...my last pair before these where the push to talk series they had with the awfully big attachment piece. over time, the wires frayed and while i did look into it, i wasn't covered. I went on a oddysee out of spite to find a better yet cheaper solution. It was pointless. The monster line does not have a equal line, i tried and spent, monsters don't equal shure. Finally I had a birthday coming up and decided I was going to spoil myself in a royal way so I figured out what the latest 500 series was and grabbed em...

for the 500 series upgrades I have done, this was the biggest upgrade of em all. the detachable earphone from the primary wire line setup would have solved my problems years ago and eliminated the need for future upgrades. for those that have not used 500 series shure earphones, it involves a ridiculously weird bending excercise for a proper fit that over time just leads to frayed ends. That is still going to happen with these but the difference now is you can buy a replacement set of wires and just plug em in to the detachable earphone units and be as good as gold for the fraction of an upgrade price.

also, the default wires provided are finally built to a better quality that catches up to the competition, they don't fray as easily, they have a better quality to them, the earpiece bend part of it has a molding plastic to it to keep the proper bend better then has been possible before. in retrospect, it's hard to believe that shure asked you to spend 500$ for a set of their earphones and while it gave you the stellar audio, the fact that it gave such a subpar build quality to it is astounding.

from an audio standpoint, they sound like the same shure 500 series from 4 years back so if you took care of your 500 series shure from back then, no need to upgrade from an audio standpoint. I've had fairly expensive etymotic sets, i've gone to the 300$ range for monster sets, even fell for the apple in ear set, tried a few others as well. You have to spend 500$ plus to get these, that said, there is no spending 100$, 200$, 300$ 400$ and getting comparable sound. If you love your music, it'll never sound better then with a 500 series shure.

my one last complaint of them though is the default wires have no mobile phone buttons solution to them. For that, you need to spend a bit more for a another set of wires which I could fully accept but when you buy those mobile phone compatible wires, the build quality goes back downhill again. it's cheap wire, no form fitting earside wiring, no kevlar coating, its crap. It basically gets to the point you buy them for the times you want the mobile controls but you stick to the default wires for primary listening. To force that on a consumer spending 500$ plus is pathetic. I have stuck to the default and have found myself reaching for the control pod only to remember this defiency. these are in everyway 5 star earphones because for what i have ever tried, the competition is nothing more then 3 stars in comparison but this one fault of these set force me to drop a star mainly because it was a easy fix, it was a ignorant omission."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me first say that it is difficult to rely on reviews for something like earphones. So, I will try to write this review with that in mind.

I have owned and used these earphones for almost a year now, and would buy them again in a heartbeat. They are superior to any earphone or headphone I have listened to.

I recently set-up a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort IIs, Dr. Dre Beats Studios, Sony MDR-7506s, Sennheiser CX 880s, and my Shure SE535-Vs. Myself and two others were listening to a variety of music through a fantastic headphone amp setup. In short, there was no comparison - SE535s were CLEARLY above and beyond everything else in every category.

I am a budding sound engineer and look for quality. These are quality - let there be no doubt.

If you are looking for an upgrade to your iPod earbuds to listen to your mp3 files on, these are going to be more than you need, but will still be a drastic improvement. If you will be using them for musical instruments, audio work, live-concert mastering, or listening to music through a quality amplified set-up, you cannot buy a better pair of earphones or headphones."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Truly awesome sound. Definitely a difference between this and others. Is it worth it? That is up to you, but I don't regret it. I used to have the SE535 but lost it. Those had the behind the neck wires. I liked that better because you could cinch them and they held in one place...and out of your way. These, because of the controllers, go in the front of your neck. Great headphones, either way, just pick your poison.

They are expensive, but they are awesome."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok. So I tried the 425 and immediately returned since the bass wasn't very pronounce. OMG!! the 535 is crisp clear on more instruments I can distinguish compared to my 3yr old SE215. Bass is good. Can focus on each instrument. I feel I'm in the studio recording or on stage playing with the artists. I'll keep these for a while before I eventually try the 835's.
Can't go wrong with the 535."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my 3rd pair of Shure earbuds. I started out several years ago with the 100 series ones. When they eventually died, I picked up the SE530s. My first set broke during warranty and Shure promptly replaced them. The replacement pair went on to last for nearly 5 years with regular mountain biking, running, gym workouts, and constant listening. When they finally kicked the bucket two months ago, I contacted Shure to see if they could be repaired (loss wires, drivers still worked fine), they informed me that while they were outside of warranty and could not be repaired, they would offer me a really good deal on the current version SE535. Well, the 535's just arrived and I they sound every bit as good as the 530's. I've read from another review that he found the 530's to be warmer - I agree, but I'm also guessing that the 535's will get a little warmer as they break in (most speaker type things need a break in period). Unlike several other reviewers, I actually found the shape of the 530s to fit better in my ear. With the 535s I have to use the largest foam tips and they still don't feel as snug as the 530s. That said, I went jogging with the 535s and they stayed in for 4 miles without adjustment.

Now... anybody who says these sound thin and have no bass either has a broken pair, bad hearing, bad taste, or doesn't know how to wear them regardless of whether they claim they do or not. These earbuds are stunning and pretty much make all other headphones and earbuds a compromise to use. If you have never tried something like this, you are in for an exceptionally cool treat, because the first time you use them is like hearing all your favorite music for the first time. They are very revealing to your music, you can hear fingers on strings, natural decay of drums and other percussive instruments. Truly magical."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was very happy until after not very intensive use they started to lose contact between the cable and the ear piece. When you lose contact - you lose sound. The left and right channels cut in and out continuously unless I keep my head and body perfectly still...
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not an artist nor am I a producer im just someone who listens to a wide array of music and instruments. These headphones are without a doubt worth the price. They might cost as much as the device you will use them for (or even more) but if any time in your life the phrase (you get what you pay for) has been truth, then im sure this is why. I started usin shure back with the E2c'S which was around 2008. Those were $100 dollars and up to that point the biggest investment i had made for headphones. They lasted a while, i ended up gifting them to my little brother and he broke them last year. Then i moved to the $299 E4C's which were simply amazing but had a problem with the cable.it broke twice right where the cable meets the monitors... thankfully, shure repaired them both for me free. Last may i decided that everytime i spent more money on headphones the quality went up (i was hesitant because i honestly thought it would not get better than what the E4C's reproduced no matter how much more i paid), and then came the SE535's. for the first week i didn't notice any more dynamics and i wasnt so pleased with the extra cash i had spent. i went between them both exchanging them to bring up comparisons. that was only during the first week. after that i really started noticing the details and its been amazing. You hear things you never did before, a drum, a effect, a guitar.... and it feels so intimate. These headphones block so much noise, and if you really crank up the volume i promise you wont hear a train, a plane, a truck, anything.... they are that good. Because of that they really excel reproducing uninterrupted and uncontaminated sounds. its really explendid. the cables on these are also removable. this is amazing because most of the time the headphones work its just the cables (which go through most of the hassle since they are the ones dangling around) so that makes them easier to just buy a $50 cable, rather than send them in for repairs. I have a year and 7 month with them.... no issues yet. (once i was running with them and some of my perspiration appeared to go inside the opening between the cable and the unit itself rendering my left earpiece not sounding. after grabbing a napkin and blowing some air they functioned fine and have been ever since.) all in all, i highly recommend these headphones base on my experiences.Great buy!!"
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best headphones that I ever owned. Please keep in mind that they come with many ear tips. It took me a while to find the right size for my ears. I use the smallest size of the rubber ear tips to get a full seal fit when I put them in my ears. Once you get over that,the sound quality will blow you away...and yes there is plenty of bass. Why only 4 stars?.. I think is are a little overpriced in my own opinion. I've read other reviews,are they said they are a investment. Hopefully these earphones will last for a long time. Other then that,if you want one of the best earphones,buy them,you won't regret it."

2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Score! The headphones that I've been looking for for years.

I fly a lot. So much that I'm at the top tier (1K) of United's program. I've never flown without some headphonese and I've gone through a good bit of them. I'm always looking for noise cancelling due to spending so much time in the air. In the past, I've always gone for active noise cancelling (the 535's are passive) with fair success. In the past I've owned 3 different set's of sony's, the MDRNC13(Crap), Sony MDR-NC40 (great NC for the price), and their top-of-the-line MDR-1RNC (Overpriced and Overrated) and a set of the Sennheiser CXC 700's (decent).

All of the above are Active Noise Cancelling which means they need a power source to activate the NC electronics. A big drawback of the actives is that they require a battery and usually have a big bulky switch and battery compartment hanging somewhere on the cord (exception being the Sony 1RNC).

The 535's, being passive, do not need the battery and thus are less bulky. I've found that the passives also seem to cause less fatigue on my ears, except for the expandable foam in your ear canal that blocks out the external noise. I want to try the custom fitted earpieces, maybe that will take care of that issue. If fitted correctly, these 535's give me nearly the same level of noise blockage (technicaly Noise Isolation) from any other set I've ever used. I haven't tried any of the other earpieces that came with this set - they may provide an even greater level of noise blockage. However the reduction in noise level is good enough for me as shipped from the factory.

Sound quality: These phones bring my music to another level. I hear things in music that I've never heard before. Just listening to oldies that I've heard a thousand times like Hey Nineteen or FM by Steely Dan, to my hawaiian music like Iz Kamakawiwo`ole, is almost like re-introducing me to these songs. Absolutely beautiful sound. I can't say that about any other headphones I've owned which also includes non-NC types like Grado's and Bower's and Wilkins.

I'm far from having the ears of an audiophile. When I read some of the self-proclaimed experts and their descrips, I'm thinking ""what?"" I really can't relate. Good for them for having those ears, I don't have them. But these are the first phones I've had that I can say ""I've never heard anything like them."" Last year I reviewed the New Sony active NC cans. I paid about the same that I did for the 535's, and I was sorely disappointed (and wrote an Amazone review saying as much). I'm so glad I came accross these phones, Hopefully these will be the last because I've spent a small fortune on headphones, maybe I'm finally done!

Another positive thing to note is the carrying case that comes with these 535's. The case is a nice looking hard case with a zipper. Having a hard case is the best, especially for these very expensive small things. You don't want them getting crushed or damaged like they could be from a bag or soft case. A soft case came with my Bowers & Wilkins C5 in-ear headphones and it is so poorly exectuted (from engineering to manufacturing) that I can't even use it.

CONS:
Made in China.

Not the coolest looking things, almost looks like a medical device (I've got the clear, I think the Bronze or Red would look better). However they look a lot better than that stupid looking ""b"" :-)

They are a bit light on the bass, but that's not a biggie for me.

Great job overall Shure!!!!"
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are amazing! Incredibly clear, crisp, rich, deep, full, balanced sound. As another reviewer said, the sound seems to cascade from inside your brain. These were factory replacements for older, damaged SCL5CL. The wires on these are a little less bulky and more user friendly. The wire connections to the various components are reinforced and much better quality than older models. I had been using the SE315 while I procrastinated in sending the old ones in for service. The 315s are really nice but the 535s are out of this world. I gave the 315s to my daughter so finally sent the older, damaged set of SCL5s in for service. Great service from Shure, about an 8 day turn around. If you love your music, these are a must have treat!"
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a highly subjective review. I'm no audiophile , but I know when I can make out a difference in what I can hear and taste and these are a WORLD Of difference to my ears

I owned my first shure IEMs ( in ear monitors ) in 2007. They were Shure E4cs and at the time , they cost me an arm and a leg. I bought them from Hong Kong duty free after reading the glowing reviews at Amazon, and I wasn't disappointed . They sounded amazing, I truly heard instruments, sounds that I had never heard in my favourite songs and I was in bliss.

Then the cords started fraying . I taped them up, but eventually had to surrender to the fact that they were dead. I contacted shure and they told me that they were out of warranty and would need replacement. I couldn't afford to then , so I managed with a succession of average earphones.

I made some money and I bought a pair of Bose QC15 headphones . I loved the noise cancelling , which works well in planes, but is also good to grab a nap when the kids are noisy ... My wife uses them more than I do for this. Anyways, they sounded good, and the noise cancelling was great, but the sound was not mind blowing.

I remembered with nostalgia , my old Shure e4Cs and thought.. Maybe shure has something as good, or better and started research . Most of the reviews pointed to the SE 535s... They had triple drivers and everyone said they gave you the holy grail I sought.. New sounds in music I already loved, new instruments, new nuances.. A new experience

So, they cost almost twice what my E4cs cost.. But this was 5 years later and inflation happens.. I deliberated for 4 months and finally bought them

I'm just starting using them now , I haven't ""burnt"" them in for a 100 hours as I'm supposed to, but they still sound great. The music sounds more "" wholesome"", I can hear new sounds in my old music. What I feel even better, is that I don't have to stuff the foam sleeves ( the best sleeves, IMO) into my ear canals, they are way more comfortable than my old shures, and I can still feel the pulse of my heartbeat in my ears without any discomfort at all. These are very comfortable and don't come with what I had come to expect as a standard sacrifice for in ear phones.

The cables.. the Achilles heel of my old Shures,is now more sturdy, has memory on he upper third (plus..is that Kevlar?) AND is user replaceable!

The Shures also come with all the right sleeves, the black foams ( my favorite ), the yellow foams, also good and the other triple flange ones , adaptor and case.

I'll be back for an update, once I've reached a good burn in... But they already sound great. My Boses are nowhere close, neither is a pair of 400$ Beats cans I tried for an hour at the shop.

So, in short:

1. The SE535a sound magnificent
2. The bass is really good and this is without a really tight seal like I had to make with my old E4cs, I don't understand the reviews that say otherwise
3. Each instrument is clear and I can appreciate sounds I never noticed before
4. They are unlike my other experience with IEMs in that they are comfortable, very much so.. I notice these sort of subjective feelings, are very much in line with your pre-existing expectations . I expected some discomfort and experienced none, and hence I am very happy.
5. They are far more robust and should last a while.

A great buy if you value your music experience as much as you value your new smartphone. Expensive , as there are cheaper options that might sound as good, but I think that they are worth the 500$"
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these today because I needed in-earphones for live guitar on stage, I haven't yet used them for these however I can safely say I'm very happy with the sound and know they will do a good job blocking out the sound on stage.

I have been using cheap speakers and they are so good in comparison. Tested a variety for earphones including the Bose QC20i (not ideal for musicians, not true flat earphones ideal for a more honest sound) and was considering purchasing the SE315 however could justify the extra money because of the depth in the sound. You are able to clearly hear the different instruments in the music, as there are 3 speakers in each earphone stops alot of muffled sound when multiple instruments are blended loud together. Considering that cord is replaceable makes it a logical choice meaning that when the cable is broken it's simple replaceable (which I think is a must with expensive earphones).

Love listening to these earphones it's like listening to these songs in a new way entirely, sounds very 3-Demensional and has great depth, bass, mids and slightly rolled off highs (which is good for avoiding harsh highs at loud volume)."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using many in ear headphones (Klipsch, Etymotic, Sennheiser, others) I thought it was finally time to try what may be the best you can get without custom molds, which add another $250 to the cost over and above the cost of the earphones which are very expensive themselves (think JH Audio). These 535s are very pricey at close to $500 but not as expensive as those.

My experience with headphones has taught me that fit is critical. Usually the most comfortable is not the best sounding. Usually. Getting that tight bass reinforcing seal is so important that without it, you could come to the conclusion that a pair of phones absolutely suck when the real problem is the earpad shape, size, material, etc. These come with an excellent ""fit-kit"" of 10 different kinds and sizes of pads. I found that the largest foam tip supplied gives me a very tight, sound isolating and, most importantly, comfortable fit for hours. Interestingly, none of the aftermarket tips that I prefer to use with my Klipsch S4s, the Comply TX-100s, work for me with these 535s. The point I am making is that it is well worth your time to find the best eartip to use for any in-ear headphone, no matter what the price. Also, when you get a good fit, the isolation is far superior to any ""sound-cancelling"" earphone anywhere.

These give me the clearest, most transparent sound I have ever heard in any earphone or speaker I have ever had the pleasure to try. The negative to this is that you can hear imperfections in the recordings very clearly but conversely, these earphones can really make your old recordings sound new as you hear nuances you had never heard before. Bass and treble are well balanced, bass is deep but not boomy, highs are delightful. These are also built like tanks and I would think they could last a long time. I am very pleased with my purchase although I could have saved a bit if I had ordered through Amazon.

I highly recommend these for those who want seriously good sound."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE535 about two years ago because of a really good sale at the moment (and as a splurge present for myself that Christmas) I was an aspiring musician playing in the local church circuit where I could use these as in-ear monitors via Aviom Personal Monitors and since then I have never regretted my purchase.

These are some solid in-ear headphones for both personal and professional use. The range, accuracy, depth and power of these ""earbuds"" still makes me fall in love with music I've been listening to for years. Taking time to just listen to tracks over and over again continue to shock me because I can just experience all the minuteness of music production, be it light percussion in the background of a track, the finesse of a concert pianist, the complex synth and drum beats of a dance song or the powerhouse vocals of a diva. Enough cannot be said about the sonic performance of these in-ears.

Being (still) an aspiring musician, I play with other, much more talented musicians at the various churches I play at and most of them have custom-molded in-ears, mostly double or triple driver variations but what is amazing about these earbuds is that the isolation that these guarantee me even with just the silicone tips is amazing, I can sit next to an unshielded drummer and not be worried about hearing a clean mix out of my ears. Even the weeks I don't play the flexibility of being able to lend other musicians who may have forgotten their in-ears is worth it so that they don't have to go without ears or use earbuds.

I couldn't recommend these in-ears anymore highly to somebody on the fence. Whether you're somebody who just likes to appreciate well-recorded music on an audiophile basis or a musician looking for in-ears that you don't need custom-molds for (but you can get custom molds for these too!), Shure SE535s are the 'buds to beat."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely hate these. Way overpriced. They hurt, they're hard to place in the ears."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why I chose Shure 535 in-ear headphones (but also applies to their less expensive 425, 215 models) - they are the only brand that meet ALL the stringent criteria below:
1 Pro studio quality sound - flat balanced response that's not clinical or over-cooked
2 Max comfort fit earbuds with alternative earbud options
3 Generous (2yr) in-country warranty and support (sadly not available via Amazon-based sellers though, at least in the UK)
4 Replaceable cables - yes!!
5 iPhone-compatible cable control
6 In line controller has good button differentiation/response
7 Max gain headroom using iPhone (75% all you ever need)
8 Secure ear canal fit while on move
9 Max isolation for optimal bass extension
10 Robust build quality
11 Near zero cable whistle
12 Custom moulded earbuds available
Whatever you buy, please consider all these factors before making your final decision - I had three pairs of Etymotic HF3 and loved them but gave up on them as they only met about 3-4 of these requirements. Good luck!"
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I still have my prized SE530s, though 1 wire sheath (where it attaches to the body of the earphone) is gone and the other is super-glued on. I don't know how much longer they're going to last, so I ordered the SE535 intending to use the better sounding pair until one dies. This allowed me to perform a detailed A-B test between the two earphones.

Using the silicone tips I usually use, as well as the foam tips I usually don't, to my surprise, the old SE530s sounded superior to my ears. Though the SE535s were ""brighter"", I thought the 530s were clearer. I felt the bass was punchier from the 530s as well. Don't get me wrong. The SE535s are good earphones, but for the price, I was expecting better performance than the ""n-1"" version. I realize the cables are now detachable, etc., though I'm addressing sound quality only.

I'm not sure if my experience is due to an internal design change, or rather, if (as I suspect) the problem is that the body of the earphone itself prevents as deep an insertion into my ear canal as the SE530 did.

For this price, I don't think I need to settle for being anything less than enchanted. I'm going to send these back, hold on to my SE530s, and explore other earphones. YMMV"
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you buy this product expecting it to make your iphone, ipod, or android sound amazing you may be somewhat disappointed. It will be an improvement over the earbuds supplied with the device obviously, but you'll feel as if you may have wasted $500 just because your device isn't meant to drive earbuds of this type of quality. If you really want to take advantage of this amazing product you need to have a player that can play lossless (FLAC) files and has either a line out to which you connect to a portable amplifier or buy a portable high resolution player that can play FLAC files and/or other equivalent files. An example of this type of player that is reasonably affordable is the Sony Walkman NWZ-A17 ($300). You'll be amazed at what the E535s (with the correct ear piece) and the walkman (with the correct equalizer settings) can do. You'll never want to take these out of your ears. You get to the point to where you are disappointed when your flight or your workout is ending just because you don't want the music to stop. Educate yourself a little about high end audio and you'll not be disappointed with this entry level (into high end audio) product."

Eventually you'll even upgrade the cable. The word is...the reds DO sound better than the clear or bronze so in that regard the opinion is that they are worth it.

I travel every week and use the largest ear tips included along with the android cable via a samsung galaxy 6.

Sound quality is exceptional. Really rich, full and enveloping. The removable cable is also great, since they always end up breaking after a few years and need replacing. I had an older version that I loved, excellent sound quality and very comfortable to wear, but after the cable broke, I took advantage of the shure upgrade offer and sent them back, and purchase this version with the removable cables. Nice, right... brand new headphones. Not so great. I do not know why they redesigned the exterior of these. It is all hard and square edged in places... actually really uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The removable cable comes with this pre formed flexible loop that goes over your ear, which makes for a secure fit, but the problem with these loops is that they get tangled in every wire they come in contact with. I listen to music at night and my headphones are on the floor next to my bed, where I also charge my phone. If I try to get my phone and plug in the headphones, the charging wire and the headphones always get tangled up, and you can't just shake a little to get them undone because the loop are like hooks that get, well hooked on everything around them and themsleves. Half the time I spend a few minutes untangling it all before I can put them on. PITB

So sound wise they are great (***** Five Star)
Comfort (** 2 Star)
Ease of use (** 2 star)

I would not recommend these to my friends at this point, and I will certainly look for another model by shure or a completely different brand next time I decide to buy a pair. Unfortunately given the cost of these and the fact that the cable is now replaceable, I don't see that happening anytime soon."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my pair of Shure's SE535CL. I had the E5C's for some time, and the cable finally gave out. One feature that I really like about 535's is the replaceable cables, even though it's Kevlar, It's nice to know it can be replaced. I was very happy with the E5C's, and that's why I opted for Shure again. I always want the best, and these don't disappoint. Hooked up to my Ipod, they sound great. Hooked up to my Amp, playing my SG, they're amazing...(Caution: The Ipod is limiting as far as volume goes, a 100w amp is not.
I consider myself an Audophile, but I'm finding it difficult to notice the difference in sound quality between the SE535's and the older E5C's. I would love to do a side by side challange, but Shure replaced my defective E5C's with the 535's. They were out of warranty, but Shure will give you a replacement for Wholesale priceing. I got mine for 250.00....Thanks Shure....You Rock."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the previous model of this high-end set, the SE530. After two and a half year, the cord finally broke at the connection point between the cable and the ear piece. It is a known issue with that and similar Shure sets. Shure corrected the problem in the SE535 (newer model) by adopting detachable cables, so that if the cable needs replacement you do not need to throw away the whole set, which is what I had to do. Shure replaced my out of warranty old set with the new model for a flat fee of about $250 - no bad if you consider the price of a new set of SE535.

In comparison to the SE530, the SE535 produces the same fantastic sound I got used to, possibly even better. Bass seems to be just a tad more prominent (a welcome addition, in my opinion). The level of discrimination of these earphones is hard to believe. You can hear the movement of the guitarist's hands on the instrument. No matter what type of music I throw at it - classical, jazz, rock, pop - the set does not stop to impress me.

So why is this marvel not for everybody? First of all, this is a closed set that requires a tight seal into your ear canal. While I have grown used to this, and in fact, I love the effect that the seal produces, some people find it uncomfortable. My wife, for one, cannot stand this ear set for more than a couple of minutes. I can go for hours and hours, such as on a long plane ride, and still have no fatigue (in fact, in a loud environment, the seal will isolate you from the loud noise, so it will diminish the hearing fatigue effect).

Also, achieving a tight seal can be tricky at the beginning. Follow the instructions in the manual and in the reviews from other users (drive the earpiece OVER your ear, not from below) and you should learn pretty quickly. Just a little tip: if you feel that you are struggling to insert the earpiece into your ear canal and keep it in position, you may be tempted to use a larger foam tip. Don't. Try to move to a smaller tip first. The smaller the tip, the deeper you can insert the piece in the canal, and the more stable the piece will be. You will also achieve better overall sound quality. So my advice is, always use the SMALLEST tip that can produce a good, permanent, comfortable seal.

Finally, there is the price. But let me tell you - once you try and get used to this level of qualitgy, there is no way back to a cheaper set. You truly get what you pay for."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great craftsmanship. First of all, let me just say, you will only ever truly benefit from these headphones if you import your music at a high bit rate or at least 256 vbr. The sound is just outstanding and Shure continues to make great sounding products so I wont't dwell on the sound. My only small complaint is the wire. The 3.5mm jack that connects to your mp3 device is in the form of an L shape. That means that when you put it in your pocket it will bend against itself. What does that mean? Eventually it'll short circuit on you and before you know it, it's time to replace the cord. Shure will do it for you but to have to go through that process over and over can be quite annoying. Other than that. These are great and worth every penny. AGAIN YOU MUST IMPORT YOUR MUSIC AT A HIGHER BIT RATE, PERHAPS IN THE 300'S."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the SE310s that I've owned for years, the response is excellent--I can finally appreciate the subtleties of choral music without getting my ears blasted by a fortissimo from the soprano section.

The excellent response can work against you if your audio source isn't high-quality, though. When I plugged the SE535s into my computer (an integrated sound system on the motherboard), there was a noticeable hiss, with spikes that coincided exactly with hard drive activity. These buds are sensitive! If you're looking for something to plug into your iPod, you may be better off buying a less sensitive set of IEMs.

I've read a few recommendations for dealing with a noisy source: using a discrete sound card in your computer, and a digital-to-analog converter for portable media players or smartphones. Until I have a chance to try out these recommendations, my quick n' dirty solution has been to set the source volume as high as it will go and use the included inline volume control dialed almost to 0. This filters out all but the worst of the hiss.

The sound isolation is about the same as the 310s.

A couple negatives: definitely not as comfortable as the 310s. The body of the IEM has a tendency to dig into various parts of the ear. In my case, it stopped being noticeable after a while, but was annoying at first. Also, the adjustable wire keeper has a tendency to get stuck on the wires, definitely a step back from the smooth action of the SE310 keeper.

All-in-all, I'm fairly pleased with them. The negatives are mostly annoyances. The sound quality is excellent, and the modular cable system means everything that can wear out can be replaced."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound of the headphones but my concern is with their durability. I've owned these headphones for three years and have had to send one earbud or the other back for repairs a total of four times. The last repair was out of warranty which cost $90 because Shure says they replace the repaired earbud with a new one, not a refurbished one, but one provides a one year warranty. At this rate I'm looking at repair cost of $100-$200 every 18 months or so. Maybe its just me but I expect more durability from a product that sell for $500 and by the way Shure has the worst customer of any corporation that I've ever done business with..."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, about myself. I am not a audiophile by any stretch. I enjoy music and I primarily use a Zune HD or my PC with ZunePass. (BTW - ZunePass is AWESEOME.)

Prior to purchasing the SE535, I've had the Westone UM2 for about 5 years. The UM2 was my first entry in to the IEM world and it blew my mind at how great music can sound. It was like night and day difference between any earbud headphone and an In-Ear-Monitor (IEM) that completely shuts out ambient sound. The separation between the high and low frequencies were so incredible that I was amazed at the difference.

So after 5 years, I thought I give a 3-driver IEM a try. I could have purchased the new Westone UM3x but I had a great opportunity to pick up the Shure SE535 at a great price so I pulled the trigger. Thus my subjective review is based comparing the SE535 to the Westone UM2.

I listed to three songs on my Zune HD with a 3.5mm audio jack with 2 ports. I plugged in each IEM so I can switch back and forth.

First, I listened to David Guetta's Toyfriend from the One Love album. This is very bass beat driven song. In comparing the two, I couldn't tell the difference. My guess is because of the over powering bass, whether you have a 2 or 3 driver IEM, it will be difficult to hear the benefit of the 3-drivers.

Second, was Jason Marz's I'm Yours live version. Here I noticed some difference in the overall sound. It's hard to describe but the SE535's seemed more full where as the UM2's seems a bit muted. Don't get me wrong, the UM2 sounded great but I did notice that the SE535 sounded better.

Third, Eric Johnson's Cliff's of Dover live from Austin, TX performance. For those who don't know Eric Johnson, this is a Grammy-winning master piece of electric guitar performance. (Very subjective, I know.) This is where I think the SE535 separates from the UM2. In comparing the two, again the UM2 is great to listen to but I noticed that the SE535 was much more full. I don't know how better to describe the difference other than saying ""sounds more full"" but the sound seems more ""alive"". I wish I had better vocabulary to describe the difference, but I don't.

All in all, I will give the SE535 5 stars but if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars from an overall value/performance stand point. I feel like I have been spoiled with my first IEM being the UM2 but in comparison, although the SE535 sounds great, it wasn't tremendously better than the UM2. Thus the 4.5 star rating especially given how old my UM2 are and the fact that a 2-driver IEM will probably meet most people's needs.

With that said, the build quality of the SE535 is top notch. The cables are so much better than the UM2. The UM2 had breaded cable and while better than majority of the earbuds out there, the new design of the Shure's cables are very sturdy. However, they are a bit thicker and I haven't quite adjusted to popping in the IEM. I am still adjusting between the more flexible UM2 cable which I can fit in my ear very quickly to the thicker and rotating cable which I have yet to master. But I figure it's just a matter of time.

With that said, if price wasn't an issue, then I probably would have been more brand loyal and picked up the latest Westone IEM. However, like I said, I was able to pick up the SE535 for a very good price so I jumped on it. My biggest problem (if you want to call it that) is how to wind up the cord properly to put it in the case. I have no idea what the center plastic piece and how to use it in the inside of the case. :-P )

Hope this helps."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazingly good product! Better reviews of the sound quality are already written here, so I'll focus on other features that matter greatly to me.

First, the many options for the ear cushions guarantees that you will find one that you really like. These earphones seal to your ear canal just like the foam ear protection that you might use during construction projects or at the gun range. You don't need ""noise cancelling"" when you seal the noise out of your ears.

Second, for those considering this product vs. the Bose products, the key advantage for me (besides the amazing sound quality) is the size. The hardsided carrying case is about the size of an iphone (but twice as thick). You can EASILY carry the carry case in a shirt pocket. What good are headphones that are too big to carry with you on every trip.

Lastly, I purchased the optional cable with mic and controls for my iPhone. It works perfectly. The strangest thing I noticed is that I can actually hear surrounding room noise in the room through the mic and earphones! A million times better than using the earbuds and mic that came with the iPhone!"
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a huge fan of Shure in ear headphones for a long time. I've tried about every mid-high end pair out there-- and these are the highest of the mid! My last pair were Shure E4c's that had the bad habit of losing connection after a year or two of abuse-- er-- hard listening. So I decided to move up in class to the 535s.

The first thing that struck me was the sound. These are quite simply the best sounding in ear buds I've heard, short of the $1000 dollar high end models. Bass is tight, but not missing. Mids are perfectly natural-- even on wind instruments and strings. Highs are brilliant-- as to be expected (Shure usually gets these right, no surprises here). From The Beatles Rubber Soul to Solti's CSO conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony masterpiece-- then changing it up with Gene Harris' All-Stars Tribute to Count Basie-- it's total immersion-- everything you want from a set of earbuds.

Construction is terrific. Hard plastic casing but more important-- the cable is braided, making the wires tougher to snap under stress-- and at the critical joint between the cable and earbud-- where most ultimately fail-- there's a thick plastic shrink wrap for durability.

On the comfort side-- these fall a little short. After a few hours, I definitely need a break. My old E4c's were more comfortable. But if you're looking for the best-possible sound (which is, after all, what we want, right?) look no further. They cost more, but deliver."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would purchase these again. If they ever wear out, I will happily do so. Along with my Focal K2 Power car speakers and my Totem 'The One' monitors at home, these round off the damn fine sounds I am fortunate enough to enjoy in my life.

I had originally purchased the SE210 model in '09, but after about 15 months, the cable on them began to fray and split. With the two year warranty I was able to put what I had originally spent on the 210s toward these. (I'm in Canada, and this was done through a distributor in Montreal I believe.) I'm glad I didn't settle for less. Though the 210s weren't too shabby for the price, I noticed a tremendous improvement with these. I have far too much music (over 180 days' worth in my iTunes library), and much of it is in lossless form. Music covering all genres. Some studio stuff, some recorded off soundboard, and some recorded from the audience. Some of it is 24 bit, and so on. Even through the iPhone's DAC, they sound great. I am saving up for an external DAC for my phone though. (At the time of writing, V-MODA didn't yet have a 'VAMP' for the iPhone 5. I wrote them and they said they are working on it.) Back to the cable issue, 27 months later, the superior construction of the cables on these has held up very nicely, in spite of very regular use. There are no signs of any real wear.

Apart from the fantastic audio reproduction (and improved cables), I really like how well they fit flush in your outer ears much like a proper IEM would. It's totally possible to have them in and say, sleep on your side in bed. And though these aren't the only 'phones with viscoelastic foam inserts, I really do appreciate how much they cut out ambient sound. Sometimes I do work for a friend's landscaping company, and particularly when music is playing through them, the gas-powered weed whacker in hand is virtually inaudible, for instance. As I'm sure others have mentioned though, I imagine riding a bike in traffic with these in could be potentially dangerous. Also, I find it's generally easy to move about a fair bit, without being concerned with the the cords coming out of place (from behind the ears, and down yer back and into the pockets of your pants, whatever the case may be), though initially it might take some perfecting before you get everything fitting and staying comfortably in place, yadda. I recall the instructions providing good tips on this.

Good stuff Shure. Good stuff indeed."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these amazing headphones for about three or four weeks now. The sound is hands down, perfect. The only complaint that I have is the bass, (the headphones are perfect, but some of the songs that I used to love, I now realize how lacking they are) but it has nothing to do with the headphones, it is just the songs. In the month that I have had them, I have at least gotten 100 hours of use with them, I don't go anywhere with out them. I would have given them a 5 star. Had the wire for the heaphones not broken already. For a $500 retail. I was expecting a top of the line quality product (not just sound). So on top of the $440 that I had spent on them, I had to spend another $30 for the wire. It was a huge let down for me. I understand that all wires break, but for less then a month of use and having to get another wire. Maby it was just a faulty product or maby it was just my abuse. I am still very dissapointed anyhow. All in all, if you are looking for an amazing sound, these are the ones you want!"
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best earphones.If you have nice interest in sound engineering and want to listen quality music buy these earphones.

Sound quality :-
In order to get the best sound quality you need to find a nice fit . if base is weak means you didn't got proper fit.Best way to get a proper fit is trying different ear forms during the weekend , it might take half to one day to get an nice fit.Please note that human ear canal sizes are different you may spend other day for second ear.
I got perfect fit using two different forms , I used medium form tip for left ear and white 3 layer tip for right ear. It looks odd for 3rd person but you need to sacrifice couple of things to get an proper fit.

Noise blocking :
you can block the outside noise 100% by using the form tips. Like other companies like Bose and Sony , Shure didn't invested any money on sound isolation using artificial circuits and batteries , Shure used old human technique of closing your ears with finger ( finger is best pointing device as per Steve Jobs) in noisy environment.. What Shure is invented is form tips instead of fingers.

Value for Money :
Another innovation is detachable cable . Iphone user can buy and adopter and can use these earphones with I device."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You will not regret this purchase! I previously used the Bose QuietComfort® 20i Acoustic Noise Cancelling® headphones. They were good but do not come close to achieving the sound quality of the SE535s. I also find the Shures to be more secure and comfortable fitting.

Important: I experimented with a variety of the included tips and now use the fattest ones possible. They are snug when I remove them. This fit is KEY to best sound isolation and quality. I also hear performance improving as they break in. Extremely happy with the SE535s!"
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile... but I can assure you that these are the best sounding earphone/headphones/headset/speaker-in-your-ear-cause-i-dont-know-what-else-to-call-it I have ever used/heard. I've owned several Beats before, all of which has either ripped or broke, and several other budget in-ear headphones... none can compare to this bad boy.
Luckily for me, I did NOT have to spend the hefty price tag of $500+, and at first glance, I would not purchase an earphone for that kind of price either. But after sitting down and actually listening to my playlist, Holy Ginobli!!! These provide clarity and just the PERFECT amount of base to thorougly enjoy your music.
If I had the money, I WOULD purchase it, as it would be a great investment. Cables rip? Easy, purchase a new one and attach that sucker right into the earphones (one of the coolest features).

7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth every penny. I find myself buying a new set of headphones every few months. I've been through most manufacturers: AKG, Beyerdynamic, Shure, Audio Technica, Bose, Sony, Denon, and more. There's nothing like a set of open-back design over the ear reference headphones set with a nice quality preamp in a quiet dim lit room, but how often do you find yourself in that scenario? I grabbed these and a Pelican Micro Case to keep them safe. Let me tell you: they're fantastic. With some minor equalization, you can get these things to sound like your favorite rig, but with the big benefit of doing that anywhere! Almost 30dB of sound isolation is more than enough to separate you from the environment and immerse you in your music. These are my first multi-driver headphones. The difference between this and the single and dual driver sets is astronomical. Accurate bass response, clear and open mids, with acceptable high end for small drivers. I encourage audiophiles that are tired of lugging around closed ear designs to try these out. They're a big investment, but very likely a lifelong one."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile or expert. I like to,listen to chill out music, new age,ambient - soft with a variety of interesting sounds - the shure535 provide excellent range, clear and with sound isolating ear buds that work wonderfully well provided you have the right tip, fit and insert them correctly. I really love the sound I receive. I use Bose earbuds at work which are fine for the office but when I want to sit back and listen to my sounds the. I put on the shure. A lot of money but you do get what pay for with these."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a musician, primarily in a church setting. I play drums, lead electric guitar, rhythm electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and do vocals. I went to these after using our standard dual driver Westones, and I am very impressed with these. The sound quality is quite good. It handles the lows very well, whereas on single or even dual drivers, I would occasionally get distortion when mixing the lows.

The only complaint I have about these is that the memory wire doesn't hold that well, but they hold them in place, which is enough for me. They sound very good, they seal off well (almost too well, if you want ambient sound), and they seem very well built.

If someone doesn't have super discriminating ears, they may not notice a huge difference compared to some decent dual driver IEMs, but for me, these are noticeable better. Especially since I often am mixing in specific channels (custom IEM mix) and want to get some of that low punch from the bass and the kick drum."

2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use Shure for several years and still love it, everytime I bought the same one SE535LTD because it's red and black.

3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love the sound of a reference-level (studio) headset, but don't want the bulk or the bleed-through of competing external noise in a car, a plane, a train or anywhere, I'd be surprised if you can do better than this.. I know they have a version with four MicroDrivers but I don't miss the recorded base or any other sound feature that the recording artists where trying to deliver with these.

I accidentally broke my prior S535s - and always buy up when I take a loss. This is definitely buying up. Deep base, crystal highs, full mid-range. If you want more base, you can always crank your input; but I seldom feel the need (unless the recording is weak).

I do use my pro-level reference full-size headsets at home some times, and while better, they're actually only marginally better. (and much more expensive). At home. you usually don't have noise - and often need to hear a phone ring or someone call you. So each has its place - but large headsets are not portable to most. The SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone give you almost the same thing as the high-end, pro headsets, yet provide portability and noise canceling without any noticeable degradation in pure, sound pass through such as hiss or any other impediments to your discerning listening pleasure.

4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned, but lets not overlook they are, by far, the most expensive headphones I've ever owned. I've had them for just over 2 weeks and they're great. I use them all day at work (SWE), and on my commute on the train.

Before siding with these I ordered some Ultimate Ears 700 and Bose IE2 and they don't even come close. I was trying to decide between those 2 and still unsatisfied, I purchased these - once you spend >$100 you better be satisfied. There is no going back after listening to these.

The noise isolation is unmatched. The sound of the train is non existent. The bass is tight, the mids and highs are clear and crisp. A good seal in your ear is important for the bass to sound full.

When listening, you need to only click up the volume 1 -3 clicks on the device to block out any noise. Running these through my phone on my commute, I have it 3 ticks from the bottom. At work, through the computer, 1 tick up from the bottom. These really are amazing. I listen to a wide variety of music and these are great for all genres. I've listened to Beethoven, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Lil Jon, Adele, ZZ Top, Tool, 2 Pac, Van Morrison, Lady Gaga, Techno (Paul Oakenfold, Armin Van Buuren), O.A.R., Dave Mathews Band, Kenny Chesney, Moby,..... you get the idea - these headphones do a great job.

I use these for my commute, work, working out, and to keep quiet when my wife doesn't want to hear it. They stay in and in place when I go for my run.

My only 2 complaints - 1, price of course, but you get what you pay for. 2, after 6 or so hours of continuous wear my ears ache a little bit. This can probably be solved with custom fitted earbuds/tips - not for me, but a 20 minute break is all I need to finish out the day in them. I thought I would regret spending so much ($400ish) - because c'mon, that's expensive, but no buyer's remorse.

Really great product, but these are priced using the value based pricing model. So if you're debating about purchasing them, fret only over the price because Shure delivers on the quality side of the equation."

Shure se535 = Balance, Balance, Balance! I had never understood what other reviewers meant when they talked about balanced sound. Well, now I do thanks to these iem. Didn't know what I was missing!! My insight is that balance definitely equals clarity imho.
I've had these for a week now. I ordered them right before going on a week long road trip (lots of ""wow"" moments). I researched for a while trying to decide on either these or the Sennheiser IE8s. I don't regret picking these one bit. They sound absolutely stellar. They have a very wide sound stage for an iem. A crisp, transparent, and detailed sound. They will bring out the tones in your music that you maybe had not even known were there (mid-tones). They put you right there in the room in an indescribable way. The beauty of the se535 is that they can be subtle and warm, yet bright, lush, and energetic. They are definitely expensive, but if you're into quality sound, the enjoyment you'll get out of these is worth every penny. Go for it!

Since I travel internationally quite a bit (as well as spending hundreds of hours on domestic flights each year) I tend to plug these into my ears with the expanding foam sleeves and once settled not remove them for hours. I've been known to wear these for over 15 hours straight on long multi-segment flights. They are very comfortable, and aside from having to immediately deal with the wax build-up in my ear from lack of ventilation in my ear canal, they have no negative physical impact on me.

Sound Levels:
Because the foam sleeves block out sound as good as my 30dB foam earplugs I wear when sleeping, the noise from jets, terminals, cars, and such are vastly reduced and I can clearly hear what I am listening to without any need to turn up the volume. In fact, I can hear extremely subtle details in recordings with ease because the general noise floor of the environment is about 30dB SPL quieter with these IEMs in my ears. Also, since I don't have to turn up the music to hear all of it is all its glory, I do not experience listening fatigue from exposure to high SPLs over long periods of time. Great stuff!

Sound:
The overall balance is smooth, natural, and realistic. The treble is not bright and harsh like most headphones (which is popular because it gives the perception of higher definition and detail through boosted treble) and the bass is smooth and natural without drowning out the midrange (again, not popular because earphones cannot make your body vibrate like a real subwoofer so boosted bass is often an added feature of popular headphones to give the impression that a subwoofer is around). These IEMs sound like life, as best any earphone can offer. There is no irritating midrange dip that forces the brain to work hard to understand speech in movies. There is no brash presence often confused with loudness in concerts. There is no fatness in the bass to muddle up the nuance of a good recording. Just natural, smooth, realistic sound. If a cymbal shimmers on the recording you hear it, a bass drum rumbles the room, you can hear it (though no headphone can make your chest vibrate). I can go for a day with music constantly playing and never get tired of the sound. No listening fatigue at all.

Ease of Use:
I experimented with all of the sleeve options, even third party products, and settled on the Shure Large Foam version. With my older generation Shure IEMs I used the Medium size foam sleeves, so this was a surprising change for me. I carry a few spares in my bag for when the ones I am using get old. I generally get about a 30 to 45 days from a pair of sleeves before they lose their ability to expand and hold in my ear solidly. The cable is easy to manage, but it isn't as flexible as the older models. I use these as my phone headset as well, so I usually have the accessory cable attached to them, but on long trips I will swap out the cable for the standard stereo listening cable. I love the comfort of these things and have gotten very good and inserting and removing them rapidly.

Highly recommended!

Compared to the more affordable Shure IEMs, the SE535 has clearer and cleaner bass, silkier treble, and generally more precise sound which is so natural I sometimes forget I am wearing IEMs when listening to great recording or watching an interesting movie.

To me, that is the sign of an amazing sound reproducer - these completely disappear and you forget you are wearing them and are completely engaged in the music or movie you are listening to."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding in-ear monitors, but you should be forewarned that they are very good at isolating sound. It is very difficult to hear what a person is saying or to hear sounds in your environment (a phone ringing, a car driving by, a baby crying, etc.) while wearing these. It is pretty inconvenient to take them in and out in order to talk to people frequently. Some of the strengths of these monitors can also be weaknesses: secure fit and extreme noise isolation. Sometimes I find my self wishing the cable was shorter (or a shorter cable were available) as it can easily catch on things while walking around my apartment (like a doorknob) and they will try to come out of my ears in a painful way (but will not actually come out because of the secure fit)."

The balance of these headphones I find allows me to listen to them for hours and hours with very little ""listening fatigue"", and I have even fallen asleep with them on.

Sure, it's an investment, but these will no doubt pay for themselves in short time. Think of how often you replaced your ""made to break"" marshmellows, eye candy, klipsch, or other low quality earbuds. Also important is that Shure stands behind their product, and it's unlikely you'll find a Shure customer who can say different.

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price you pay, these are not a good deal in today’s market. While they are certainly better than your average earphone, the sound is incredibly hyped. The bass is deep and good for an IEM, but the midrange is so forward that it’s painful at higher volumes and the treble is severely lacking. I’ve owned many pairs of earphones and my 10-year-old UE Triple.Fi 10s sound light years better than these overall. They are not good for mixing and mastering as they are not flat enough. It is painful to watch movies or TV shows listening to them because the sibilance and midrange from these actually hurt my ears. Maybe they would be good for mixing vocals since the midrange is so sensitive, but overall the spectrum is not well represented. I love how they fit in my ears, but hate how they sound. I have $10 earbuds that sound better than these."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded to these from a pair of Shure SCL5's for in-ear monitoring with my band, and also for personal music listening. I thought the SCL5's were hard to beat, but these SE535's are hands-down the best audio delivery devices I've ever owned. This new 3 driver setup makes a world of difference. They provide an extremely balanced, clear, and detailed sound. I'm hearing intricacies in my music library that I've never heard before with any other headphone. With the right EQ settings, these things will throw you so much rich and punchy low end you'll wonder how they can fit all that sonic goodness into such tiny packages. They're almost addictive... my music sounds so good that I don't want to stop listening. Aside from the sound quality, Shure gets high fives from me for some smarter design decisions, such as the detachable earbuds, lower profile crossover/splitter, and the little adjustable silicon cable split sleeve (not sure what it's actually called) that works WAAAY better than the slippery piece of PVC tubing they used on the SCL5's.

While they're a bit on the pricey side, these things deliver! Any working musician who demands clear and defined output from their in-ear monitors should highly consider these. I also recommend them for the audiophile who wants massive sound with a low profile form factor."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all of these reviews with curiosity. When I tried these in the store, they sounded tinny and cheap. After the sales rep's pitch and another customers insistence they were awesome I could not figure out what they were talking about, Then the rep changed ear fittings, I pressed them in to my canal and OMG! The audio response was full range and sensual. I have tried Bose, Sony, Skull Candy and a a few more - None, I repeat, none compare to these 535's.

Consider this... when we listed to MP3 players, the music is already compressed and the audio quality is reduced significantly as a result. When you listen via typical speakers and cheap headphones - the compression loss doesn't come close the the sound reproduction loss you get with these cheap speakers and headphones. BUT these Shure 535's reproduce the sound in a beautiful way - providing the richest reproduction of the compressed MP3 audio i've heard. It far exceeds my tuned home theatre surround should system in audio quality and performance. Embarrassing when I compare both investments.

Speaking of investment - these are an investment. So I hope they last a while. So far no issues with build quality, but I remain aware of the few concerns mentioned here."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had quite a lot of expectation when I bought these. My other phone is a Samson SR850. Much cheaper than these.
The first impression that I had when I plugged it into my LG G3 is ""Noise"".
These phones are extremely sensible. The lousy sound card on my LG G3 cannot driver good quality sound.
Then I plugged it into my work PC (HP): less noise but still audible.
My wife's Iphone 6 can driver something better to it.
So if you want to have these for hearing music, first find a good source with noise signal ratio of about 120 db.
About the rest: comfort, sound quality, bass, medium, treble, they are as good as the price.

If you want some amazing sound, go for it. But also go for an amazing sound source."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audio junkie. I have PortaPro by Koss which I've been using for the last 5 years or so. I loved it and didn't think the sound quality couldn't get any better when it comes to earphones. I was proved utterly wrong when I bought the Shure SE535-V. It's like comparing a BMW to a Ferrari, or a similar analogy, haha. The sound isolating technology makes the sounds even more crystal clear. The Bass on it is unmatched.

Some people seem to complain about the design. The suggested way to wear them is to put the cord over the back of the ear. It took me a while to figure it out. Initially, as I was attempting to figure out the fit, I was afraid that I might be disappointed in the fit and the design. When I finally got it in my ear, I was still like ""I have to keep doing this every time?"" But I have to say that the fit was REALLY good and snug. You could be headbanging while you listen to Rock music and it won't budge one bit. I know because I tried it. It's not uncomfortable at all. Just choose the right size earpiece that comes in the box and you should be fine. So getting back to putting the earphones on...I just put it on for the 4th time since I got it yesterday and I'm already used to it. It just takes a few extra seconds to adjust the wire over your ear and once it's there, as I mentioned, it's very comfortable. In fact, the aspect of the design where you put the cord over the back of the ear keeps the earphones securely in place. So I am completely spoiled now. I hope this review helped alleviate the fear of the design a little."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Bose Noise Canceling headphones fell apart from general wear and tear (putting them on and taking them off again), I decided to upgrade to the Shure 535, so far I'm very happy with the build quality.

Forget trying to cancel noise, just block it, seems so obvious. The noise isolation is fantastic and far superior in result.

The sound compared to the Bose are in another sport, never mind a different league, excellent indeed. Not that over accurate Bose sound at all, far more detailed and pleasing on the ear.

I now realize as one of the 50 people on the plane with my little red noise canceling LED, I was a rather ignorant headphone lemming.

Should you buy these? Yes."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm keeping the rating at 5 even with the complaints I have with the size of the drivers. I've owned a good number of Shure earbuds over the years. My first were the Shure e3c. They lasted about a year, then the cables started having issues with the area that goes over your ear. Then I upgraded to the SE210's. Same thing happened. Then upgraded to the SE530's. Fasntastic sound! I was hearing things in my music I've never heard before. But I had to get warranty work done on them. With such an investment, I sent them in (the others I didn't much care to replace, decided an upgrade was in order). They sent me back the 535's.

So, the SE53x line, for some reason, confuses me every time I try to put them in my ears. I know there are R/L's on the bud, but they're hard to read and I feel I should be able to know by feel, which one is which.

Also, the bud is a -lot- larger than all previous models I've worn. I know its because there is much more hardware, but its' noticeably larger. And was uncomfortable at first."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a pair of Shure SRH1840 Professional Open Back Headphones (which I paid more for) andI have been extremely pleased with... but these sound better. Other reviewers have mentioned it as well - it is like the sound is not in a speaker but in your head. I cannot imagine a more intimate and realistic listening experience than what these headphones provide. I had high expectations when I bought these and they have exceeded them.

I should also mention that I bought these because my iPhone and iPad can't drive my 1840's (although my MacBook Pro can) and I was looking for headphones that I could use with my iPad and iPhone. These deliver. They are very efficient and sound every bit as good with my iOS devices as with my MacBook Pro.. I would imagine the same is true of Android devices.

If you are looking for headphones to use with portable devices, I don't think there are better headphones."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from SE212s that were getting a bit old. The price turned me off at first but I'm so glad I splurged. The low end is defined and not muddy at all. Mid-range is perfectly tuned. High end isn't tinny. These sound like my very expensive studio monitors. Other brands that pump up the bass end up destroying what the musician and producer originally intended. These earphones provide the truest experience.

The sound quality is so good that I canceled my Spotify account because I could hear how compressed and lacking everything sounded. These earphones will highlight the good and the bad in the music you're hearing."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded from an old E500 to the newest SE535. E500 was an upgrade from e5c (hope I got the v# right, it was 10 years ago). Both earlier models were replaced due to worn cable, so the detachable cable on the new SE series is definitely addressing this historical issue. The reinforced curve on the SE535 is not only keeping the cable in shape but also comfortable to wear.

In the sound area, comparing to the old model, the base is crispier and bunchier reminding me a little bit Boss. The high is very sharp and the mid is full. Personally this is different from the sound I am used to listen to Shure for a long time (40 years).

I read a few reviews commenting the earbud does not stay in place. This new model does fit differently from the E500 round shape and a bit larger. However, once I got used to it, they stay in place pretty well for me. I also worried how tight the detached cable can be staying connected. I just got mine as new so have to give it some time to find out.

I give five star rating for the following reasons:

1. It is obvious that Shure and learned from the past models and improved the durability in both design and key frequently wear out areas. I have high hope that this pair of earbuds will last me a long time (my first pair lasted only 2 years and the second pair lasted 6 years). There are also improvements in the accessory area, the oval shape box is much bigger than the old round box and I don't have to gam the earbuds in and also bit the airplane adapter and one of my old microphone cables.
2. The sound quality is very modern and fast, it works with both music and games. I use this primary for my iphone so it is a good match. I tried it on my home stereo equipment which is Passlab amp + CD and turntable and the result is not what I would listen for a long time. My normal speakers are B&W D803 which share some sound characteristics with the older Shure models. SE535 is different but I like it.
3. The build quality of the product appears to be solid to me. The cable housing is thicker than the old model and the shape of the connector allows me to leave it at the bottom of the iphone 5 and not worry the possible bending the cable (old model has a 45 degree angle, new is 90 degree). The earbud itself has good sound isolation (the old E500 had an active noise cancelation piece that works well in flight; I have not tried SE535 in air yet).

Compare to Sennheiser IE80 and B&W C5, Shure SE535 is a pricier model so direct comparison is not fair. I have purchased Sennheiser, B&W & B&O and ended up giving them away and stayed with Shure for years. All of these other brands are great products and deliver good sound, but Shure provided me with not only good sound but also an overall solution for music, gaming, phone, travel through additional accessories which all work with SE535. I don't mean to imply others brands can't, but just like I stick with one camera brand because all the lenses I bought, I am confident that Shure will continue to evolve and expand this product line thus gives me the confidence to stay loyal with them.

In addition, Shure service is where I upgraded from E500 to SE535. I sent in my E500 to repair the worn cable, Shure charged a fair replacement fee and send me a new SE535. It's like a trade in, a smart way to keep customer. I don't claim to be any expert in audio or electronic equipment. This is one regular long time user's feedback for your reference."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a longtime musician and I've never owned a high end set of IEMs until these. I was getting by on some $50 bass earphones until I stepped up to these babies. They are amazing. Durable, well built, and lightweight they scream quality. If bass is all you care about, these may not do it for you. I would describe the bass as rich, not overpowering. They deliver a clean distinguished range of sound from highs to lows. With my bass buds I was missing clarity. These deliver that in abundance. Highs, mids, and lows will come through beautifully to you. As a drummer, I needed to be able to blend many instruments, vocals, and my own drum mics together seamlessly. It's hard to believe how well they accomplish this. Now to me they are great because I need them to be. If you only listen to music casually or don't consider extreme audio clarity to be a must, you may find a less expensive option more viable. Like me, if you demand the best I'm not sure that you will find it anywhere else."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"decided to splurge and buy myself a xmas present, so shopped around and chose the shure se535's. these are far and away the best earbuds i have ever had the pleasure of listening to (and i've listened to a bunch). simply put, the music comes alive more so with these earbuds than any others i have previously listened to. very comfortable to wear, at least to me. and they block ambient sound out pretty damn well, so much so that i'm not going to wear them when i dog walk (spca volunteer) or ride my bike.
if you've got some extra money to burn on some damn fine earbuds, i don't think you can do much better than these. very happy with my purchase."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying, prior to this pair, I owned a pair of 5$ in ear headphones that worked properly for about two months. this was my first significant purchase of a pair of headphones, so if I don't sound like an expert, just know I'm not.

I'll start off by addressing my own complaint: I hate the color! I hate the color SO MUCH, I wish 1000x that they were at least moderately fashionable, the sickly sort of weirdish brown they get from the finish and then the casing it's put in make them look absolutely HORRID. they look atleast okay when looking at them in the picture but the picture doesn't do it justice, it's just awful.

now, you may be thinking, ""Why would you buy a pair of headphones like this if you cared so much about the color"" Answer, I don't care about the color, it's not why i bought them, it's literally the one thing I actually have to complain about.

The performance is PHENOMENAL, the surround sound, the depth of the bass the pitch of the treble and the noise canceling are like nothing I've experienced in my life. I was no more than 10 feet away from someone mowing the grass and literally the only indication I had that they were mowing the grass was because I was watching them do it. I heard every single last sound coming out of my headphones and not only that the sounds were clear, well developed and the volume was even low. I have always enjoyed classical music, and one of the most thrilling and exciting experiences about classical music is listening to every single part in perfect detail. when you hear the bow gently strike the cellos behind the roar of the drumbeat and the scream of the trumpets and you can hear every hair slide across that string watching the lawnmower pass you by, you KNOW you've got good headphones.

This being the first really high end pair i'd bought I'd done quite a bit of research and read quite a bit of reviews, and I'd like to allay the fears of anyone interested in buying them.

I'd read prior to purchasing these that the treble can become quite overwhelming while listening to these. Now, when you generically listen to whatever you're listening to this is very clearly true. with a triple micro driver system, it can be easy to become overwhelmed, but this is also exactly why equalizers were built, and after a quick fiddle with the equalizer on my computer, I was able to easily compensate for that, and while you might have difficulty with that if you're listening on an mp3 player that doesn't have an equalizer, it's easy enough on most smart phones to download an AP for that, and if your MP3 player doesn't have an equalizer that seems in my opinion to be more of a problem with the player than the headphones. Another visible reason why this is, is because since it's not a headset, and that it's small earbuds that sit in your ears, the bass doesn't really have the same sort of booming vibration it normally would, especially because it's much easier to listen to music at incredibly low volumes.

another complaint I've read and this one I've seen a lot, is that they're too good at shutting out noise, and that should you find yourself out for a walk or on a bike ride, you'll be unable to hear anything around you. this is less of a con and more of a pro. they are DESIGNED to cancel out noise, as well as the fact that I'm a cyclist myself, and over the years I've learned that listening to your surroundings can very easily save your life, whether it be someone driving too fast behind you or it being a dear or fox hiding in the bushes who just so happens to jump out right as you pass, the ability to hear these things in great detail is paramount. I'm certain much of the same could be said for going for a run or a walk, but as I don't do that very often I'll leave that area to anyone who does.

the last complaint I'm going to cover is the fact that they are a bit heavy. when you squeeze down on the foam tips and slide them into your ears there's an immediate noticeable pressure. the way they fit into your ears they feel bulky, which I'm sure is why they wrap around the ears for better stability. at first I found this a bit difficult to get used to, and I feel like, if I only occasionally used them for long periods of time, it would become tiresome quickly, but my primary use for them is when I'm either playing online games or working on writing my book, and I use them for a series of hours each time, after enough time getting used to that, they feel perfectly comfortable, and I have no problems anymore with it. so really it's just something you can adapt to and get used to.

Bottom line, as far as I'm concerned, I have no real complaints, and no buyers remorse at all. they were worth every single penny and I would buy them again should I somehow get caught in a time spiral and wind up having to do it all over again."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not much more I can say about the SE535 accept they are simply awesome!

If you are a bass head, look at the Beats by Dr. Dre brand. If you like to hear your music the way the artist intended, the SE535's are worth every dime. Also, I bet if you go to Dr. Dre's studio, they are most likely not wearing Beats.

The sound from the 535s is so precise, they will point out a poor recording. I listen to lossless .wav recordings (320kbs) and the SE535s make it seem like you are in the studio, making all of your music sound like the first time you've listen to them.

The Mids are front and center. (Vocals are amazing)
Lows are accurate and super quick.

They are quite wonderful. Get High Quality audio and equalize them out to your needs and you'll see. I find without an equalizer they are weak on bass and have too much treble.

Okay.. umm. To add to this.

All the reviews on here are bugging me so incredibly much I'm going to add a little more now that I've actually owned these a little longer. The burn in time does make a difference in bringing out the bass, which is tight, can be deep-ish. But not always. I'm sure an amp would do them great justice. They may be Very pricy - yes. But the soundstage is absolutely freaking unreal and the listening experience you get from these is so personal. I become easily immersed in them, from both their sound, and their Stellar isolation.

My arguments against other reviewers who could set you off:

-The cables have NEVER broken. I've never once had a problem with them. Though I treat them nicely, wrapping the up not too tightly around two fingers before putting them in their case after every use.
-They fit very very well in my ear, once I found the right size silicon foam for my ear.
-They block out so much sound I can barely hear people when NO music is playing!!! They do Not need sound isolating technology whatsoEVER. So whoever says that is freaking bogus and put way too little effort into finding the right foam tips or learning how to put these in. Sure you Will suck at putting them in most likely for a couple weeks until you figure out the absolute best way to do it. It takes me about 3 seconds to squish the tips, 2 second to get the in my ear and put the cable over my ear, and another 7 seconds to let the foam expand. JEEEsHHH"

Admittedly, I am hard on my earphones as I use them while running and working out. The performance of the Shure product speaks for itself. However, what really sets Shure apart, IMHO, is the way the company stands behind their product. If you purchased the product from an authorized dealer and ever have an issue with the product, Shure will take care of it without hesitation. Shure simply the best in terms of customer service and commitment to their customers!

9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a pair of SE530s a few years ago and absolutely loved them. The hype surrounding that model was definitely high but the headphones more than lived up to expectations. About two weeks ago I sent that pair back to Shure for a minor repair to the cabling, an issue that the 530s were prone to. Within 7 days, Shure sent me a brand new pair of SE535s -- not only a new pair of headphones but an upgraded model from the one I wanted repaired.

I have never seen a company stand by their products the way Shure does. And I know for a fact that mine is not an isolated incident; there are plenty of testimonials online speaking to the same level of care.

Buying high-end headphones was a big purchase for me. In the future I will always feel more comfortable making purchases like these knowing that the Shure name is standing behind them."

The 535's are extremely clear and accurately expose the tone of every musical element."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously I wrote that Shure would not repair your earphones after the warranty period even if you are willing to pay for the repair cost. This is what I heard from Shure Canada when I asked them about reparing my SE530 earphones. They also told me that Shure US would not repair them either. I was frustrated that I had to throw away the $500 earphones just because of broken plastic pieces and wrote a negative review as below. However, when I contacted Shure US, I got a different answer that they would replace my earphones with new one at the cost of $150. I just received the replacement earphones and I am happy about how Shure US handled this. (I am still unhappy about Shure Canada though. They even tried to sell me a replacement earphones for a lower grade earphones (SCL5) at $200. This one does not even come with a package or a warranty.)

My previous review ============================
If you are thinking of buying this expensive pair of earphones, you should be aware that Shure will not repair your earphones after the warranty period (2 years) even if you are willing to pay the repair cost. This is their repair policy regarding earphones, that I confirmed with Shure Canada. (They told me that Shure US would not repair them either.) I wish I had known this when I was buying a previous version of these earphones. I thought that I could use them for long time on the presumptions that 1) these earphones would not break under normal use and 2) I could get them repaired even if they broke down. Apparently both of my presumptions were wrong. Something to think about if you plan to use the earphones for more than two years."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hope that this review will help someone who is ""on the fence"" on investing in a pair of SE535s.

I have owned multiple pairs of Shure headphones, some middle of the line and also pair of top of the line SE530s. I use my headphones almost daily, for work and for pleasure, and when I use them I use them for many hours at a time. In fact, I think I place an extra level of use on my headphones, more than most people would. I travel the world for business and I take my headphones and Iphone with me where ever I go. I don't need to spend any time raving about the high quality and exceptional sound that Shure creates with their headphones, there are plenty of reviews that can attest to their superior fidelity and you should expect nothing less than perfection when laying out $500 for a pair of headphones, however I want to focus on the customer support.

After 6 months or so after my original purchase I started to have problems with my SE530s, specifically the left earbud would cut out at the lower connection. I sent the headphones in and they were immediately replaced with a new pair. All was good until about 6 months or so the problem happened again, so I sent that pair in for repair and they were replaced. All in all, I replaced these SE530s three times, the last time almost a year AFTER the original warranty ran out. Shure customer service were always courteous when I called, and replaced my product(s) without issue and almost immediately after receiving my old headphones at their department.

Now, don't take this review as a problem with Shure's products. I believe that anytime a company produces a product there can be problems that occur. What I experienced with my SE530s were an exceptional product, with exceptional sound, that had a hard time under exceptional usage. Now, this could have been bad luck, or hell a bad design for all I know. Shure stood by their product and looked out for me as a customer. That is what I want people to take away from my review.

In the end, I purchased the SE535s and decided to keep my SE530s as a backup. I felt the SE535s with the replaceable cables would function better under the extreme usage that I put my headphones though and so far they have performed as I expected them to.

There are few things in the world that you really get what you pay for. The Shure SE535 headphones are in a class by themselves within this group."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE 535s are fantastic! By far the best monitors I've ever owned. I had doubts about paying hundreds of dollars for the 535s but now that I have them it was worth it! I never want to take them off. I've had them for about two months and now have a problem. The right monitor cuts in and out. It is probably the cable. Disappointing after reading all the reviews about the improvements in the cable. I'm sending them back to Shure for repairs tomorrow. Even though the warranty will cover it, it is still a pain to have to send these back for repairs especially this soon after buying them. I can't wait to get them back though. Even with this problem they are still worth it and by far the best sounding monitors IMHO."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing for clarity. If you listen to jazz, classical music, vocal centered music, or anything where the bass is not the defining feature, you'll love them. I listen to a lot of metal and don't have an issue with these. The experience is next level. I can pick out tiny details in the music, and anything with reverb is amazing. Somewhat of a spiritual experience since I used $20 earphones all my life. These are not for bass-heads though, and they will disappoint anyone looking for a bass heavy experience.

Very sturdy as well. I've had them for about 6 months and they're still in great condition. Parts are replaceable but expensive. If I broke these, I'd probably just save up for the $1000 ones instead of buying new parts. Curious to know how those sound."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an audiophile, but not the ""techy"" type. I can't tell you the numerical value of a sound frequency or the product specifics. I would refer you to read Shure website for this.

Instead I can tell you what I like and dislike about the SE535 from Shure.

Let's start with the dislike first:
1. The price is really expensive.
2. No built-in microphone (for iPhone users).
3. Cables are rather rigid. This may be to prevent the inner wires to break.

What I like about SE535:
1. Rich and deep bass - this can be easily tested with most dance music.
2. Amazing sound quality and character. Try listening to Sarah Brightman ""Figlio Perduto"" and you'll understand what an angelic voice is.
3. Great for workouts and running. Ear buds are comfortable and cables rest behind the neck.

Shure also provides a good warranty for this product. I previously owned the old 53C series for 3 years. The left earphone stopped working - probably because the inner wire broke. This was of course rather disappointing because the 53C was as expensive as the new SE535. I called Shure and they replaced the broken 53C with the new SE535."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extraordinary earbuds in that they truly isolate sound. Just be careful walking across busy intersections. Expensive, but given the fact the earbuds are detachable, along with amazing sound clarity, well worth the price."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these 5 months ago and the tip connecting the right ear bud to the earphone broke off, I had owned two pairs of Westones prior and had problems with their cables.
The earphone itself sounds great and has a sturdy cable but the earphone connection seems to be very delicate."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"not shure what all the hype is about, but i'd rather spend the money on some customs. i don't care too much about the mic so the wires were pretty lame to me. If i would have kept them, i would definitely upgrade the cables, but even with all that, i would just go with some custom in ear monitors.

9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had about 10 excellent earphones over $300 and this is simply the best. I have even had the SE530. The new design is absolutely amazing. It does well for the gym too if you run or workout intensely. The base and overall sound quality is superb. What else cannot say to make you buy it? yes it is expensive but a very very good investment, one that you will definitely not regret. If you are looking to spend between $200-700, I would reccomend this without a question. Stunning headphones look wise also. I have had these for over 6 months and they're as good as day one. What makes this superior to SE530 is the design, these will not have issues with the tearing at the top and that's what makes these a winner. Any question ask me. Buy and you will never look back."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought my first SE530 about 5 years ago (for $500) but they had to be replaced just after 2 years because left bud worked eratically. Shure was great for not charging me anything even tho' the warranty had just expired. The second pair developed the same problem after 3 years (so $500/5years). I had to replace them with the new 535 (which are just redsigned 530s with the same sound) at an additional cost of $240. Obviously I'm not too thrilled that these last ONLY 2-3 years at these prices.

If these go in 2-3 years, then I'm switching brands or maybe replace them with the new $100 SE215 which, for the price, are pretty great sounding too!

UPDATE: April 2015.
Right ear piece split (REP) open even tho' always handled them very gently and carefully. FORKED OVER ANOTHER $100 to Shure to REP replaced. DEFINITELY NEVER BUYING THESE AGAIN!! BUYER BEWARE!
BTW: Knowing how fragile earphones are, I always handle all of mine very gently."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just sent back a pair of the Se-530 with a broken wire.(purchased 1/10) The only thing Shure required was to fill out a one page return form and a copy of the reciept along with the broken ear buds. Four days later UPS shows up with a brand new set of Se535. Now thats customer service! I wish other company's would stand behind thier products like Shure did.As far as the ear buds performance same great sound but with a much heavier cable. I use my earbuds daily when i work out so they do get used! keep um clean and they will never let you down!
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The wires of my Shure 530's got frayed and I got the 535's this week and I couldnt be more blown away.
It is a huge step up from the 530's (didnt think that was possible) in terms of sound clarity and the fit.

With the 530s i rediscovered heaps of albums in my music collection and with the 535's I am re-discovering them all over again."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 535 has been improved in several areas from the earlier 530 model, the latter of which I have two samples. The build quality has been discussed elsewhere. It is substantially solid and commendable. The replaceable cord is almost indestructible, but it being replaceable it is a non-issue.

More important is the sound quality which has been dramatically improved in a number of ways due to refinements to the shaping of the cavity within which the balanced armatures are fitted (I speak about the ""speakers"" inside which are more comparable to tuning forks than typical electo-magnetic speakers.) The crossover points between these armatures may also have been refined and adjusted for flatter response - meaning audibly flat, rather than just measurably flat. The external shape of the device was changed too, and it should fit more comfortably for many ears once one gets used to inserting them.

While a few listeners reported hearing ""no difference"" between the 535 and Shure's earlier 530 model, I strongly disagree. Or given that many people really can't hear even dramatic differences, it is merely true for them, but not true for those who can hear minute but significant changes between designs of audio equipment. The 535 is different from the 530 physically period. And sonically in a number of areas any sophisticated golden ear can hear. Among my audiophile acquaintances we could easily hear the improvements as follows:
1. Increased clarity and ""transparency"" throughout the frequency range resulting in better delineating of instruments, one from the other, and the textures and shapes within the sound. For example, the airy whoosh of a flute, the tinkles in the distance of a softy struck triangle at the back of the stage, the rosiny draw of the bow of a string instrument, the brassy rasp of a trombone, and the shimmer and afterglow of a brushed cymbal.
2. Higher resolution of the soundspace, such that the leading edges of percussion instruments penetrate with greater force, impact and speed. The fading tails of sound decaying away are easily distinguishable and followed to its silence.
3. The sound images locked-in-the-head feeling has been reduced significantly and the soundscape is now wider, many sounds seem to exist outside the head, even at a distance from one's ears.
4. More spatial clues and sound reflections are audible, such as naturally recorded hall ambiance and slap echo against a stage wall.
5. The bass is important to most listeners, it being the foundation for the rest and the rhythmic underpinning of music. The 535 excels in this area, even over Shure's 530 earlier model which provided deep bass surely, but not with the 535's impact, solidity and tightness, definition and textures. There are other brands with seemingly MORE bass or lower bass capability. This may be an illusion. For plumbing the deepest bass we have the requirement for very high definition. The 535 is, by a long shot, superior - you need to seal the earbud to your ear canal to hear it in all its glory.
6. One can continue describing sonic improvements over earlier designs, but there are space limits. Conclusion: I have not yet heard a more enjoyable, and most importantly, accurate portable device to date. The price, understandably, will be a factor for most people. However for the discerning listener who demands the quality of sound the 535 can furnish and will install CD Redbook standard or higher resolution audio files in their music players/iPods, the Shure 535 will be a stunning addition to their musical enjoyment on the go, in a plane, while exercising, or at home."

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars because Shure replaced my earbuds under the 2 year warranty at no charge.
---
I have had these headphones for 2 years. The sound is great. I'm not an audiophile, but I hear lyrics in songs from my childhood that I never understood before. That's all fine.
I am looking at replacing these earbuds soon though and I'm going to look at other brands first. Here's why:
1) I have never liked the connector wire. The plastic housing on the connector part is too large a diameter for iPhone covers. I had to drill out the hole on my cover to make it work. I tried to loan the earbuds to my daughter recently and she could not get her iPhone cover off and the headphones wouldn't plug in because of what I just described. I was driving, so I couldn't help her. Useless. I had to listen to PitBull, or whatever it is she listens to, while I drove. Annoying!
2) The connector wire is too stiff and took some getting used to. I got another wire that had a little mic on it for phone conversations, but it only lasted maybe 1/2 year before it frayed at an end and lost electrical contact. Now I'm back to the stiff connector wire with no mic. If only they made the stiff connector wire with a mic. Why not? I don't know.
3) I have had intermittent sound with the right earpiece for over a year. I bought a new connector wire and have the same problem. So it is obviously the right earpiece itself, IOW, the 1/2 of $350 part of the earbuds is intermittent, not the cheap part, the wire. Here's what happens, music, boogie, turn head - only sound in left ear, turn head back, sound in both ears. Wiggle slightly, sound in only left ear. Tap right ear, sound in both ears. The only thing I have found that temporarily fixes the problem is to spray electronic contact cleaner on the connectors of the right earbud. That 'fixes' it for a couple of weeks most of the time."

Pros
-Sound clarity is top-notch
-Clear separation of levels
-Wire looks durable
-Includes many accessories

Cons
-EXPENSIVE - and reason for low score. There is no way this is worth $500. Not even $300. For $300 you are better off with the B&W P5. If you don't mind the size, the AKG K271 will give you the best quality for a closed-back at under $200!

-Zero Sound Stage - Music is not all about super-clear quality. There is basically no sound stage with these buds. Perhaps that is a characteristic of all in-ear buds, but then they shouldn't rip people off with the outrageous price. Listening to a studio recorded piece is passable. However, when you listen to a live recording, fuhgettaboutit. Sounds horrible. Sounds quite tiny and in your face.

-Not Comfortable - For $500, i expect better comfort than other in-ear buds. But this is not the case.

Anyway, going back to on-ear or over-the-ear headsets. If you truly enjoy music, there is no substitute."

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The mids are good but the lows and highs are both bad. It's not a fit issue; I've had IEM before and I know how to fit them. I got near total sound isolation with these, what better fitting could there be?
I have the HD650 and compared to it the Shure's highs are almost like noise, they aren't too bright, they're scratchy and muffled.

I listened to them on a COWON D2 with all sound enhancements off. After the initial shock, I tried to correct the sound a bit with the EQ on the D2. The highs became good enough (nowhere near the Sennheiser HD650), but acceptable.
No matter what I tried, I couldn't correct the lows. They still sounded distant and weak, and if pushed they loose definition becoming muddled and slightly distorted.

The sound is clearly not something out of a cheap headphones; you can hear the individual instruments and the mids are almost perfect. If you have a way of returning them for a refund, then by all means, try them for yourself. Maybe I have been spoiled by good headphones."

1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the 535LTD for about 4 months, I feel compelled to write this review for other potential buyers. To preface, I have listened to a number of IMEs, including Etymotic ER4, HF5, Shure 215, UE TF10, Westone UM2, Westone Pro30, and most recently Sony XBA-A3.

Pro: for female vocals, the 535LTD produces absolutely heavenly sound. No other earphones can match it.

Cons: it has absolutely no bass/sub-bass. I'm not a bass-head by any measure, but I do enjoy defined and precise bass. The 535LTD has zero of that. As a result, it performs horribly for any type of music that's not female vocals (ok, maybe male vocals are also fine).

In conclusion. If female vocal is what you listen primarily, go for 535, otherwise I recommend trying out a few others first before buying."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned over 30 pairs of IEM's and earphones (up to the $1500 AKG K3003I), and I can honestly say that the previous generation shures (i.e. the SE530) are better than the current generation shures (i.e. the SE535).

In my opinion, Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE535 (replacement of the SE530) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE530 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality. The new version (SE535) doesn't go as much into your ear, and it doesn't fit at all with a lot of people...

Honestly, just because of the fit issues, the SE530 sounds much better than the SE535. It's kinda like windows vista when it first launched. The previous generation is better. Period.

Also the SE535 loses the PTH function, which was cool because it allowed you to hear your surroundings by pushing a button. Bummer."

The problem is that every time you wear it, you have to spent more time in adjusting the earphone position, rather than enjoying you music. The high price really does not mean that it is the best. I personally do not like the design; it has nothing to do with the sound quality, just the poor design makes you never enjoy it."

True the shures were clear and I guess if your using them for speaking in a helmet on a nascar race track y not.
If someone can or has earbuds that they think sound great would love to try for free as I am not buying and returning anymore.....
Good luck to all...."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this earphone last year from London I always want to buy fron shure I'm very disappointed because after a while there is no sound from the left earpiece From any audio source.
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT: Based on comments from other users, I again approached Shure and this time received EXCELLENT customer service and had all issues solved swiftly and responsively. I am impressed by Shure's service and - despite the experience outlined below - am now very pleased the company and the headphones.

Before getting these earphones, it's worth considering Shure's customer service and build quality issues. I bought the top-of-the-line SE530s (now SE535s, with upgraded cable connectors) and found that the rubber surrounding the cables to both earphones cracked and broke within the first couple of months of use (very careful, gentle use! These are $500 earphones after all) -- if you search 'Shure cable cracking' in Google you'll find a LOT of reports of the exact same problem.

Okay, no drama, just warranty them right? Except the warranty ran out. Okay, no drama, pay Shure $150 to repair them (like it says on Shure's website). Except this is a manufacturing defect that affected a lot of consumers -- for instance, read all the complaints in the thread at [...](including one case where Shure actually sent out a rebadged old model to replace a defective $500 SE530!)

A couple of months ago I sent my defective SE530s to Shure with a paid repair form and my credit card details and a polite letter asking them to either fix the defective $500 SE530s or take the $150 repair/replacement fee and replace them with the model which corrects the defect, the SE535 (my reasoning being, who would reasonably pay $150 to replace the ones that broke with a pair that has the exact same defect, when Shure has now come out with a model with a replaceable cable designed to correct the problems with the SE530?).

Which is where it gets really awful: A month later, I was overjoyed to get a small parcel in the mail from Shure. I eagerly opened it and found... the broken earphones. Not even a note or a single word of explanation from Shure. I can't even write how upset I was by this. The basic message is, Shure just don't seem to care about customers or quality. Once they've sold us the product, they won't stand behind it or even bother talking to you. I found my Shure experience really upsetting and I don't think I'll be able to trust Shure again."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 3 of these now. Let's start with the first pair. The first pair actually lasted a couple of years. But then the wire that goes above the ear just got old and brittle and cracked...on both sides. I loved the sound, so I bought another pair. This one was defective and within a week, the stem cracked. Shure replaced them without cost. Now on my 3rd pair (the 2nd I've paid for), the sound in the left ear just vanished one day. I have no idea. They were well cared for (i.e. not exposed to moisture, heat, etc.). This would all be fine and good for $50 earphones, but not for something I paid $550...TWICE."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in November 2011 and the left earpiece just quit working.

At a cost of $439.00, that equates to about $27.00/month. Since on average I use the headphones about once/week - that equates to about $6.80 for EACH use.

I am absolutely certain the sound quality they provide is not worth THAT price!

My advice -- save you hard earned cash!!"
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible. Bad. It's not compatible with all the devices. Produces an annoying ""m"" noise and buzzing. I prefer my $20 over-the-ear headphones than this piece of crap."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,these earphones are awesome their sound quality was really great until i flushed them down the toilet which was super sad
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the Shure duel driver ear buds (with a custom fix wax ear piece from an audiologist) for aprox 10 years. It has saved my voice and it has saved my ears from the demands of a noisy stage. They finally wore down in sound quality they have broke on me 3 times. Time for a new pair. I chose the middle of the road like most of us do. Keep in mind I tried these one night. They sound a little better but the chord is a lot cheaper. I used the foam ear piece that was on it because it felt pretty good in my ear. But by the end of the night the inner rims of my ear were hurting pretty bad. May be I pushed them in too much. Do not buy these for personal listening. There is no low end. They work good on a stage because they are clear and light on mid range freq. They cut through the clutter like any good monitor mix. My son uses a $29 pair of buds while playing and singing and he is very happy with what he hears. When my old pair broke I used a $10 pair from the friggin airport and they did the job all night.
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was robbed. These headphones are crap.
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The connectors to the individual earbuds are junk! First it starts out with a little bit of static when you move your head,then the sound fully cuts in and out, and then nothing... no sound.. nada! Consider yourself lucky if they last a month. I cannot believe these made it through any sort of product testing. I loved my previous Sures but these are useless junk and customer services is non existent, I feel ripped off. Never again will I buy a Sure product!"
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased this model 3 times since 2005. When I first purchased it, I had to return it for repair every 6-8 months. After the second return, I started taking meticulous care of the earphones, exactly as the manual and repairman recommended. I never used them working out, I only used for 1-2 hours a day, I cleaned my ears regularly, and cleaned the earphones regularly. But this increased the time to malfunction to 12-22 months. Without fail, one of the earphones would stop broadcasting sound. Although Shure had been replacing my malfunctioned earphones with brand new ones the last 6 years (without charge), they have started charging ($250) for repair. I've also spent close to $200 on FedEx charges sending them back. I'm really upset b/c I've spent a total of about $1700 the past 6 years for this model. I believe Shure knows that this model is defective and cannot last more than 2 years. They probably realized how much money they were losing by constantly replacing these defective ones with new ones and recently decided to give every user one or two free replacements before charging them. I truly believe this is a fraud b/c I've asked their service department many times the exact malfunction/defect of my headphones and they always dance around the question. Although the sound quality is the best available for its category, the model will probably not last you more than 2 years, even with conservative wear and proper maintenance. You will have to maintain $250 replacement cost every 3-4 years."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Regarding the Shure SE210 y SE530pth models and their cable problems.
It is supposed this earphones are the best IEMs in the in the market nowadays. Is it really?
Not at all¡¡.
Even the SE530pth model that costs around 300 euros is just rubbish. Why do I say that?
Because after a few more than the two years of warranty, the cables start to get degradation splits and cracks, and finally in less than a couple of months, one or both earphones are not more longer in use as consequence of the cable degradation...just a few months after warranty expired¡¡¡... CURIOUS.
If somebody consults the WEB, it is possible to find out that Shure replaces the damage, even out of warranty. Again... is it true?.
Not in my case. As mentioned above, I have two different shures-models with the same problem. I consulted Shure in Germany, (European headquarters). They lamented and referred me to the Spanish representative calls Earpo-Barcelona.
Upon I contacted them; they required my both earphones to be sent to their technical department for a warranty extension. I sent them. After two weeks, I had to contact again to Germany as a fault of courtesy by Earpro. Later some people from Earpro contacted me but nobody resolved me the problem, or said me where o how my damaged pair were....
Finally after another week, I contacted again with Germany, (Spanish very poor in courtesy), and again another staff of Barcelona's Earpro contacted with me for a advantage offer for the new ones?¿¿?...which to be totally honest still I am awaiting...they played to bored me...and they worked out very well in that...
As result of the last e-mail, I asked the following questions:
* A technical report in which I could identify why my both earphones were damaged in nearly two years. In fact, both earphones were at the technical disposal of Shure.
* An explanation why some customers, (in Amazon.UK there are a few examples...see for SE530 the one from S. Cole 20 Aug 2010 15:54:38 BDT, appointing ""Shure replaced them as a goodwill gesture"" ...), they had the earphone replaced, and myself with TWO NOT?¿?¿
* Another explanation, why if these products are badly designed, they are still on the marked and not have been completed retired.
To finish. Do not buy SE530/210. You will have to put in the trash in more than two years.
And, please, think twice for the new ones SE535-315 with detachable cables...in any case, after two years, you have to buy new cables....around 50 Euros each¡¡¡¡."

7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought Shure SE 535 after planning to buy it for more than a year reading reviews all around the net for several months for the earlier model SE 530 and later SE 535.

I am a music buff and am ready to pay any amount for perfect equipment.

I am very very dissapointed by my purchase. This headphone fits badly on my years almost hurts everytime I put and remove it. My ears are soar now and I have to really think twice before trying it again. I have not gathered the strength to wear them again since last one month.

Sound quality is below average. Every other headphone I have used sound better. My cheap creative computer headphones sound better. Bass is missing.... badly missing... vocals are low.... only treble sounds are prominent.....and irritating.

Cannot recommend to anyone.... why did I spent one year of my life waiting to buy this crap. and shelling out $ 500/-.

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY..."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the se530s bought these headphones about 2 years ago, before i went on a trip. I ended up opening them up in the car and didn't know at the time that you had a limited time to register them to get warranty support. about 3 months later I found this tiny metal tube in the carrying case that they came with and thought maybe it was some junk from work but the right side had no bass. About 3 months after that I cleaned them with the supplied ear wax cleaner and the metal tube came out of the one side, so I checked the other side and the tube was gone. I realize that the piece that fell out of the case a few months before was part of the head phones amd now both sides have no bass. When I contacted Shure's customer support they ended up sending me an email saying that they would fix it but charge me $145.00 for an out of warranty repair since I didn't immediately register them. So I payed $400.00 for a pair of headphones that didn't last 3 months and now just sit in a drawer. They couldn't grant me a one time courtesy for a technicality and instead tried to shake me for another 145 for their mistake. What do they care they already have my money. I'm never buying anything from they again and I would highly recommend that you look at a better company that doesn't have a customer service that just disappoints."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!!!
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was skeptical to pay nearly $500 for a pair of in-ear headphones. I knew that SHURE has a reputable reputation among audiophiles and musicians in general, but I simply had never seen such a hefty price tag for such small headphones. In the past, I owned the BOSE QC 15, DR DRE STUDIOS, and then various cheap SONY headphones I take around sometimes.

Well, my conclusion about the SHURE SE-535V was made in about half a second. As soon as I figured out how to put them on they molded to my ear. When I chose my first song to play, I chose one with a deep bass to instantly test out the depth of the headphones. I was amazed. I had high expectations - only natural for such a high price - but the headphones honestly matched them. Right away I couldn't hear anything my roommates were trying to say to me. When you play the music loud with these headphones, you literally feel like you are in your own world. You can feel the beats of songs comfortably on the inner parts of your ear and you can feel the precision of the engineering. The cable that comes with the headphones is flat out the strongest cable I've ever had and it feels very durable.

Overall, by the end of my decision, I just had to make up my mind whether I felt comfortable dropping so much money on an item like headphones - which although I use every single day are easy to lose items. So far I've been very conscious of making sure I put my headphones back in my backpack so that I don't lose it among a pair of pants, jacket or just somewhere you don't even know.

If you love music, and if you listen to music constantly throughout the day studying, doing work, commuting or just relaxing, you can not find a more premium-quality sounding and feeling pair of headphones. These are like the AMEX Black Card of In-ear headphones. Also, Amazon offers $100/off so why not. Comes with 2-year warranty."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shipping came on time and it was well packed. I'm a shure's earphone user for years and I always love how gentle, distinctive and dynamic the mids are. The isolation has always been good and I once had a good time with my SE425 till I sold it to a good friend who wants a good earphone but couldn't pay enough for a first hand. Having used SE425 and SE535, I would say both are equally decent for their mids. However, SE425 does not give that much of bass as how SE535 does. 535 has a better balance with addtional bass than having the ""kick"" in comparison to westone 3 or 4. If you love music and earphones that you can listen for long hours, SE535 is definitely a earphone to go for compared to 425. 425 gets a little dull for it's a little too gentle but it's good for those who appreciate instrumental classical musics. Many will recommend to shell a custom fit earphone by paying a few hundred more for a better fitting and customized earphone than paying for 535. I would say no to that until I've discover enough for my knowledge in sound and my habit for sound. Not an audiophile, but a fan for good sound."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will not make this a review of the IEM (in-ear monitor). I will just say that these are the best headphones I have ever heard if you have a good recording. I use these on the iPhone 5s and it drives them just fine. The mids get a little flat on so-so recordings but the bass it strong, defined, and punchy. I can even hear the sub boom... not strong but audible. For what these cost I expected no less. I have a pair of E5s and these blows them away. The E5s sound flat compared the 535s."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike some of the other reviews, these earbuds exceeded my expectations. (And they should, for over $500.) They're like a mini-surround sound system in your ears. The entire sound spectrum is crystal clear. The connection system on the SE535's are truly unique to Shure; the earbud wire that connects the earbuds to the audio source features a connection that is detachable on the earbud. So if the wire fails, you simply have to replace the wire, not the expensive earbud. Shure goes all out with the provided accessories. There are three different types of earbuds for your ears, whichever fits you best.

The sound isolation is superb. I can listen to music and can not hear myself pressing the keys on the keyboard as I am typing this review. I can have the television on at its highest volume, and while music is playing, I can not hear it. Sound stage is another highlight of the earbuds. When you listen, and close your eyes, you feel as if you are in the room with those singing and playing the accompanying instruments.

Rest assured, you will not regret the purchase. Shure customer service is top-notch, just make sure you register your product with them and keep your original purchase receipt."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found these headphones when they were on sale, so against my better judgement, I took the plunge once my Shure E2c earbuds completely died and I got sick of using my Beats Studio (a terrible purchase decision on my part, but college makes you do stupid things during your stay)to listen to music decidedly not hip hop. When comparing against the Beats, the SE535 wins hands down, and the results aren't even close. Compared to my old E2c headphones, the difference is still there, but not quite enough to justify the $400 I spent.

While the 535 sounds great and accurate, the difference is fairly subtle when comparing to other mid to high-end headphones. I realized that I had gotten so used to high bass on my Beats that the bass left me feeling thoroughly underwhelmed during my first three days of use. If you're looking for over-stimulation through bass especially, these earphones are not for you. Comparing the sound to that of my old E2c's, there is better clarity and separation, and I would say that the bass quality is improved. This is, however, not immediately apparent, and does require a fair amount of comparison.

For pop, these headphones are somewhat wasted. In classical music, however, the 535's really do shine, and after my purchase, I have started listening to classical music much more frequently.

TL;DR
If you are a huge enthusiast of music -- especially classical -- and you're in the market for new earbuds, these headphones won't fail you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't tried the SE425, so I can't say how much these earbuds are worth the actual cost. If you like pop, you should probably buy something cheaper or/and bass-heavy."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, these are my first real IEM's. I have used the etymotic MC5's for a while, but let's be serious, they're not real IEM's. I was considering going for custom UE's, westone's or JH-Audio's. I decided on the shure se-535's after reading a review by another drummer using them for live performance.

First things first, I got them and it took me a little while to figure out how to put them on. Once I figured out red=right and I made sense of the images showing me how to insert them, I finally got good sound. It also took me a long time to figure out how to get the default black medium foam tips off. I ended up using my shirt as a grip and turned them several times to get them off. With the large foam tips, they form a perfect seal.

I used them for a couple of days with just my MP3 player. They seem to take a little while to ""break in"", but even right out of the gate, they sound pretty amazing.

I finally got to try them out for a live performance. During sound check I realized that they worked better than my regular ear plugs. I basically couldn't hear my kick at all. My snare was so quiet I couldn't tell how hard I was hitting. I had to have the sound guys put my drums back into my monitor for me to hear them. They are just as amazing on stage as they are with recorded music. I could hear the low thump of my kick and the growl of the bassist, every little movement of guitarists across their guitar, and voices came through perfectly clear. For the money, I have to say that these deliver just fine! Thanks Shure for making an amazing product."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,This replaced my pair of Ultimate Ears IEMs and must say the SE535-V are even better. This particular purchase came with a $50 rebate making it a great bargain. Perfect while working out at the gym or going for a brisk run. The noise cancellation can be hazardous to you health if you live in the city and walk to get around. I was wearing mine at a reasonable level and almost got run over my a bus because I didn't hear it coming.
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is no question but that these buds project incredible sound. The bass, mid and high ranges are all quite true. Also included is a great choice of alternative ear buds, so great fit is assured. Two caveats; the wires tend to get tangled and the phones can become uncomfortable to wear for protracted periods of time. If you are willing to sacrifice some degree of comfort and are willing to pay megabucks for incredible sound reproduction, this is the set for you."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Shure SC4's started dry rotting before my very eyes, I decided it was time to make another earphone purchase. I read a few reviews and condsidered several brands before deciding upon the SE535's. You have to hear them to really appreciate how goodthey sound. Clear, undistorted, accurate sound reproduction.You can actually hear details in music you never noticed before, such as the snare being slightly off center or the airyness of the reverb.There are many headphones with more bass (and also muddy sound) but none of them compare to these earbuds. The only issue I have is with the price. 500 bucks is a lot to spend on earphones. But if you have it to spend, I suggest you take a listen with these earphones. You won't be disappointed."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's only one con, so let get that out of the way first:

The pair that I ordered (used, $420) did not come with the remote cable, but a light grey one. However, this light grey cable wasn't stupidly long (like default Shure cables) yet long enough to run it behind my head, down my back and under my arm into my jacket pocket (+ some wiggle room). I'd consider the reduced length a huge plus for me, but not for everyone.

As for the sound? JESUS CHRIST IT'S BEAUTIFUL

Right before testing them out I used the SE215s to listen to the main theme of Man of Steel (using Neutron MP on an Sony phone, no effects, filters or anything). As it was with the first time testing those, the audio was very crisp and the instrumental separation was very good, but the soundstage was small, the flavor was too warm, and they were very quiet. Also, level dynamics were a little weird. They were SO bass-biased that louder (actually louder, with a larger waveform) parts felt quieter simply because they were at a higher pitch. These were nice buds, but not the ones for me.

Then I put the 535LTDs in and my head exploded. You see, the first noticeable difference is that they are *much* louder. The soundstage is also far wider - not just left to right, even. It felt like it was making an indent between the back of my skull and my forehead. By far and away the loudest, biggest-sounding pair of headphones (over or in-ear) that I've ever laid ears on. I'm a huge volume addict and I frequently am frustrated by the quietness of the max volume on anything, always turning it up all the way and boosting it by at least 5dB, and I had to turn them *down*.

That's enough to satisfy the metalhead 17-year-olds with a death-wish out there, but what about clarity and texture?

While things were noticeably more treble-y (a given, as the frequency range goes up to 19.5KHz instead of 17), I didn't notice anything too wild throughout the quiet piano intro. But then, once things started to rev up I noticed something spectacular - everything was given much harder panning than on the SE215, yet instrument separation was somehow *better*. I could even make out a huge difference between droning bass guitar plucks and low piano key hit in the exact same L/R spot, when previously they had melded into one thing.

Everything was already much more clear, and much shinier - but then... Oh, then something happened that almost made me cry.

For this I'll need to reference the specific part of music; google ""What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?"", find a video, and take the playhead to about 2:22. Give it 17 seconds of buildup and listen to the ""chorus"" afterwards. That beautiful theme is incredibly nostalgic for me - when I was 14 that was the most inspiring, empowering thing I'd ever heard. Sadly, as with any song, the enjoyment I can take in it has deteriorated over time.

But, like meeting an old friend after a decade, when you've both grown and improved so much and the feelings and memories all come flooding back, the SE535LTDs brought ""Man of Steel"" back in full force. Not only was the soundstage incredibly wide, the frequency range bounding all over the place, the texture so smooth, soaring and heroic - it also, when taken in together, brought me close to tears and made me feel like Superman. That's what these headphones do - they take the emotion of any given track and amplify it to what you got the first time you heard it.

One thing I should warn you about though: These might make you dance. Or jump, or whatever it is that your song ""feels"" like. It's insane, and it's been happening to me *all the time*.

Something of note is that, while I always assume that I will have to make some wild EQ customizations for every pair of headphones, these were already at the standard that I try to get things to. The best way I could describe the sound flavor of the SE535LTDs is ""W shaped"" or ""Zig-Zag Shaped"". We all know about the classic, fun ""V Shape"" sound, boosting bass and treble and making everything kick and sparkle at the same time. And we know Shure is famous for the quality, clarity and near-prioritization they bring to their mids.

I am happy to tell you that this is the best of both worlds. It's tough to say whether you can call this ""free of coloration"", because nothing overpowers anything but there are frequency decisions made. You have to listen for a while to detect it, but once you do there is a clear sub-200Hz and 8000KHz-plus boost. Yet it feels almost like specific frequencies along the line between them get subtle boosts too. It manages to be ridiculously accurate, yet change the sonic flavor between individual tracks. I for one *love* this, because instead of adding a sweeping sound profile to everything you hear, it enhances the sonic differences that are already there - from album to album, track to track, even movement to movement. It's like an EQ version of dynamic range. i.e., this pair is to other IEMs what ""24/96 FLAC"" is to ""just below CD quality"".

For my more specific tastes I let the 1-2KHz and 15KHz+ areas fall to -2.5dB in my equalizer, but that was simply adding to something already pretty damn perfect for personal taste, not correcting an inaccuracy or sound flub.

If you're a basshead, know that these can ABSOLUTELY handle that - they just aren't doing it by default. Boost your low frequencies by 3 to 5 decibels and you'll see what I'm talking about.

What are you waiting for? BUY THE DAMN THINGS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT"
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased these as a replacement for my old Shure E2c earphones which had great clarity, but were a little short on bass. The Shure SE535-V earphones have unbelieveable clarity, and it is like listening to each of my tracks for the first time - like the difference between standard definition television and HDTV. There is significantly more detail to the sound and less distortion, making for a much more enjoyable listening experience. With the triple flange sleeves, and a slight trimming off of the stem to get a great fit, the phones are very comforatable and provide better isolation in noisy environments like the gym than any in-ear listeing device I have used. I would say that the sound is slightly warm with accurate bass - but I would not say overwhelming bass or bass heavy. Construction wise, these are solid. On an airplane, the Bose QC15 is a better choice since the low frequency plane noise tends to diminish bass somewhat and in-ear phones don't allow for pressure equalization. The earphones are worth the cost given the magnitude of difference they make in accuracy and listenability, and relative to the fact that they should last for a few years."

These are excellent earbuds, they are well made, comfortable, and nice looking. They have a great soundstage, bright highs, full mid range, although lacking in Bass for Musical listeners. I don't mean that in a bad way, these are monitors, and they can handle Bass well, just expect to have to bring it out with your EQ and after break in. And don't expect to bring out there full potential directly connected to your portable device, they sound good, but not as good as through an audiophile grade DAC and Amp.

The Cable is a bit long for my tastes. I'd prefer some more color options. But these are worth the costs. Buy with confidence."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They block out nearly all the sound outside and they sound amazing. Never had a pair of headphones comparable. I even work out in them and no problems with sweat or them coming out of ears. Would highly recommend for someone who wants to listen to music at amazing quality and not have to hear anything around him.
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these after a number of other earbuds including the Jaybird Bluebuds and Bose QC 20i. My trusty 5 year old Klipsch 10xi's were also still in good shape.

I figured if I were going to splurge, I'd go all the way - so I went with the limited red version.

I did quite a bit of research and bought these as a birthday present for myself. At first when I got them, I was taken aback by all the choices of ear tips. Of course I tried a bunch of them to determine which worked best for me. I get the best overall fit and feel with the gray soft tips -very similar to the ones in my Klipsch's.

At first, I thought what's the big deal with these earbuds? I truly didn't find anything special about their sound. So then I subscribed to a trial of the lossless music stream Tidal. Holy cow that's when the difference kicked in. At first it was - yeah the Shure's do sound better. But after a few days I can say that these are definitely my go to earbuds. There's no match to the comfort and sound of these earbuds. They offer just an overall superb listening experience. Absurdly expensive - yes, but so worth it."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are, hands down, the best in-ear earphones I've ever owned. Crystal clear sound, snug fit, easily inserted, and comfortable for long term use. I use them while gardening and at work. I rarely give five star reviews, but this one Shurely deserves it. My only complaint is the cable. It does not last long with continued use. You will have to replace it, but that's the nice part. It can be easily replaced. Highly recommend these earphones."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. I was nervous about spending this amount of money on a pair of headphones because I had already bought two pairs of beats by dr dre. These are totally worth it. The clarity is amazing and I have heard things in songs I never heard before, and these were songs I listened to every day. The noise isolating is the way to go. I travel a lot and these will be my go-to headphones now. It's like putting ear plugs in and just hearing the music. No outside noise, nothing. They are also very comfortable; I have worn them for hours and hours with no discomfort at all."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really accurate sound. I've read some people not very happy for the lack of Bass sound, I think this headphones has the exact amount of bass if you do your homework for properly fit the sleeves inside the ear canal, once reached, you will feel plenty immersed surrounded by your favorite musicians playing for you. Of course you must have good music quality recording to appreciate this headphones capabilities. Some times a little bit uncomfortable due to the need of tight ear canal sealing when wearing for long periods of time. I use it every day for exercise and when need concentration during my work. Really happy with them."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Obviously ear buds will NOT shake your pant legs with bass, but these do make good sound all the way down. To get the full efffect you need to go really deep in your year and make a totally air tight seal. Good news they give you at least 5 different sizes and shapes of foam holders. THe bad news is I have unusually deep ears and had to ultimately get custom silicon holders. $500 more dollars."
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned the SE530 earphones and upgraded to these when the cord frayed right at the connection to the earphone on the left ear. I loved that pair and I love this pair. No major improvements to sound as the SE530's were already really well done. I do love the fact the connection to the earphone is now removable and the portion of the wire that goes over the ear is reinforced. With those upgrades I see these lasting me a very long time.

I wouldn't buy these if you are looking for earth shattering skull rattling bass; however, these do an excellent job all around on audio high, mid, and low all very proportional and smooth. Well worth the money for any of you in doubt. Everything seems really well build and no issues with the detachable cable crackling or losing its grip like others mention."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best IEM I've ever used hands down.
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Go read the reviews on this product by T. Pines and Jed, and BELIEVE THEM. I have several pair of earphones around here and since I got these, they're the only ones I grab anymore; the others I've used before don't even remotely compare. Seriously, stop looking and just splurge. If sound is your thing, the Shure SE535 earphones are what you want. I laughed when I first saw T. Pines' review and read, ""They will change your life,"" and Jed's review where he refers to them as ""Fantasmagical,"" but you know what? They were both right. Costly or not, there's no going back now - not from earphones that sound this good."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm one of the unusual people who gets a perfect fit with Shure's earphones, so I upgraded from my 215s to the 535s after trying these out at an InMotion store.

I kept hearing the sound signature wasn't balanced, but it sounds (mostly) balanced from my ear. Bass is present but won't suit the tastes of bassheads; these earphones use triple BA drivers and don't have that ""kick"" in the low range. Mids are excellently refined, and they always are with Shure. But, in typical Shure fashion, the 535s suffer from a treble roll-off (though not nearly as bad as the 215s), though this is easily correctible with an EQ. Treble is nowhere near sparkly or analytical, but is incredibly accurate.

In the U.S., the LTD version has no sound difference from the normal ones.

The greatest selling point to the sound signature is how intimate it is. The sound has a much longer decay than most other high-performance IEMs and the soundstage is incredible. Everything sounds like a live performance. In addition, it's the least-fatiguing sound I have ever experienced in an IEM.

One thing I really like about the new cables is you can now wear these cable-down (as long as you have a good seal to keep the earphones in place). In the box, you get an iOS cable and another cable for devices without integrated functions. Cable build quality is good, but I miss the cable clip thing above the splitter that lets me tighten the cables.

Accessories
1 set each of S/M/L Shure foam eartips. They must be using a different kind of foam, because I've found them softer, more durable, and more comfortable than Comply's. Comparing them to the perfect seal I get even with the silicone tips, they provide a hefty boost to the bass range while sacrificing a bit of the highest treble frequencies (EQ-fixable).
1 set each of S/M/L Shure silicone tips
1 set of yellow foam tips
1 set of triple-flange tips
1/4 to 1/8 adapter
Airline adapter
Volume control dongle (very cheap-feeling)

Final scores:
Sound 4.5/5 due to treble roll-off
Comfort 5/5
Build quality 4.5/5 for the earphones themselves + cables.
Value 4/5. Shure products are never a good value, but they're worth exactly what you pay (does that make any sense?)

I would recommend these but only if you can try them out first, especially if you've never owned a pair of Shure earphones before. They either fit or they don't, and there isn't much middle ground. $549 (from authorized sellers) is too much to spend on earphones without trying them first."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic little earbuds. This review will not really focus on sound quality since I am no audio expert. Their sound reproduction is quite nice all around (mostly rock and hip-hop), though they are lacking in bass. Not complaining given their size though. I've used these while running and have had no problem with sweat. They are comfortable even after wearing for a long time and the build quality is solid. Only thing I didn't like is that the part that wraps around your ear doesn't really hold is shape between uses, however it does hold its shape once you wear it. The case gets the job done, nothing too fancy. The cable is long, in my opinion a bit too long, but not a deal breaker. The cord doesn't really tangle. I'm not worried about the cord breaking where it contacts the buds (some reviews on other sites listed this as a potential problem area). Overall I really like these and would recommend them if you have the money!"
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality earphones. These are the best sounding earphones I have ever experienced. I don't have golden ears, but I have had different sets of earphones over the years and they do not come up to the quality and sound of these."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are truly a work of art. The detail throughout the entire audible spectrum is impeccable. Crystal clear treble, warm mids, and deep natural bass. The bass was a little strange at first; I am used to only hearing top of the line subwoofers reach these notes, and hearing them without feeling the rumble was alien. Also the sound isolating is very impressive. I haven't taken them on a plane yet, but have had a few fly over my head while wearing the earphones. When the planes were overhead, I could barely detect engine roar with the volume turned down. When the volume was raised to a moderate listening level, the jets were not at all audible. If you have the budget for these, you will not be disappointed.

One important note for professionals: If you are looking at these to edit videos/songs you may want to consider the SE425 instead. The 535s are incredible earphones; but due to their extra miniwoofer, the sound is a little warm colored. for critical listening, I've heard the 425s are extremely accurate. The 535s are simply modified 425s to produce a more enjoyable listening experience.

Pros: Comfortable, great sound quality and range, styling, sound isolating

Cons: Case doesn't have a cord manager, naturally price, not the most accurate sound, earphone body may be too large for people with small ear antitragus"
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had the ultimate ears 10 and enjoyed those earphones until they recently broke and were out of warranty. I decided to spend a fair amount of money on these SE 535 and have not regretted the purchase since. The sound is incredible even compared to my UE's. The bass is there without being overwhelming. The Mids and highs are clear and crisp. The only drawback to these headphones is that they are extremely efficient and loud( it is very easy to turn the volume up without realizing the level because the headphones are low in distortion). You should not regret spending the money on these headphones if you enjoy listening to your music the way it was meant to be heard. I liken it to spending the money on a decent set of speakers; if you get a nice stereo and a lousy set of speaker, the sound will still be poor. Go ahead and get a decent set of speakers (headphones I mean)."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Years ago, I owned a set of Shure e4c earphones that were absolutely fantastic. They eventually had cable breakdown and just got old (they lasted about 7 years). I have missed them ever since. These headphones are at least as good as the e4c's were, and they have replaceable cables! Yes, the cables are proprietary and cost $25+ to replace, but compared to multiple hundreds of dollars for new earphones, it's an absolute steal. The cable quality is also vastly better than my previous Shures, making me think I won't have to replace the cables in the foreseeable future.

So far so good!"

0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i consider myself an audiophile, but also a pragmatic one. like with everything in life, i love a good bargain, but i also have great appreciation for all out quality.

as far as headphones go, for many years, at home i have been listening through trusty Grado RS-1 connected -as of last year- to Benchmark DAC2-HGC. for music i care about, i feed the Benchmark lossless FLAC files (jazz and classical). The Grado's have a great organic, warm quality to them, while providing all the clarity and stage i need.

for many years, i have used Shure's with foam sleeves as travel/gym/mobile earbuds. i like their linear, honest, revealing nature. i have owned quite a few, and currently own the 200/315 on top of the recently acquired SE535 we shall review here.

in a nutshell: i *love* the SE535. they are a phenomenal: the crystal clear balance and accuracy of the signature Shure sound, but it now extends lower without becoming ""fat"" and lazy in the bass. it does represent perfection. but i will point out that my requirements may not mirror others', because...

1. i make sure i get optimal positioning and seal. some people don't find tight earbuds comfortable, and rather sacrifice sound quality, which with the SE535 would be a waste.

2. i never plug the SE535 into a regular earphone port in my computer. you will always see a DAC-earphone USB device like the Dragonfly there. if you plug your earphones directly into the audio port of your computer or phone -or if your entire music library consists of 192kbps MP3s-, they are overkill. they need a clean source and well recorded music to show what they're made of. i think if you just want to plug these into your phone they represent a waste of money, a $200 pair will serve perfectly well for that (that's why i keep my Shure 200/300 series). just my opinion.

3. even though they do now have an extension in bass, Shure doesn't make earphones for bassheads. these are balanced and crystal clear, and honest. some might miss drama. i rejoice in their exact music reproduction.

4. maybe i have to get used and find optimal positioning for the cables, but they seem a tad stiff and heavy and uncomfortable when i have to move. i think they are designed for static use. they are simply wonderful to immerse yourself in music while you travel, and the isolation is the best i have experienced (with the entire SE line and the foam sleeves). i wouldn't use these in the gym, so not a problem for me. UPDATE: i ordered cables that don't have the bendable hooks at the end. i find those utterly uncomfortable, and have decided to stop fiddling with it. Shure - you ought to ship a more comfortable cable with a $400+ in ear monitor... that is my only dislike of the SE535, and it is easy to fix with another $30.

to sum it up: i think the SE535 are a fantastic investment if the rest of your chain is up to their standard. i think a good external DAC is mandatory, as is well-recorded and preferably >320k music. if not, there are probably more comfy earphones out there that aren't over $400..."
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent earphone monitors. A little pricey and not for most, but if you can appreciate the audio difference, it is well worth it."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best ear buds I have ever owned. Sound reproduction is outstanding. Passive noise elimination works well. Base is awesome with midrange and upper registers crystal clear. When I listen to music with these I hear nuances I had never heard before. Expensive, but if you want stellar sound for your important music, I highly recommend it."
3,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb build quality, amazing sound that is rich and full of detail, neat features such as the remote, mic and replaceable cables. From the high quality packaging, sturdy carry case and range of earplugs, these IEMs have it all really well defined. I've tried the Shure 425 (amazing mids but lack of depth in bass), Monster Turbines (well rounded but lack crispness), X11s (great sound but very flimsy) and a range of Beats (overpowering bass, but good overall), and found that the Shure 535s are the best I've ever owned by a long way. Well worth the extra money, but still too pricey for a 5 star rating."
4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these used from an Amazon member. So far I must say these have been very nice. They are comfortable in my ears for long periods of time and have very good noise isolation. When listening, the highs and the mids are outstanding. Acoustic guitars and vocals come though very warm sounding with loads of detail. I've listened to plenty of tracks I thought I was very familiar with only to find myself picking up on details and subtleties I've never heard before. Bass response is lacking in comparison to the mids and highs, even after ensuring they are getting a proper seal, however it is accurate and doesn't ruin the listening experience. It just may leave some wanting for more power in the lower frequencies. I would like to try the Westone 3s, but I wouldn't want to have to give these up just to have the opportunity to audition them."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm more into vocals, classic, R&B and pop.

I was using the Bose Triport earphones for quite some time before deciding to get a new pair of IEMs, tried out the Westone 4 which was too sharp for me, Logitech's triple-fi which was too bassy and uncomfortable to wear. A few other less known brand which I didnt take note of, didnt quite cut it for me either.

Shure's 535 may not be the most comfortable, but they are the most natural sounding. Wearing them took abit getting use to and finding the right size on the foams. but once you got it right, it sounds very natural, smooth. I finally get to enjoy vocals of Adele, Katherine Jenkins & Il Divo. The music from queen and lady antebellum."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is absolutely amazing! Very precise, spacious sound lets you hear every detail of the music. The bass is not overpowering, but is still very present and full, and the built in crossover does wonders for proper dispersant between the drivers and maintaining perfect clarity at high volumes.

Overall, they are the best headphones I've ever heard and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for the perfect listening experience."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent sound after break in period, I bought these almost new.

8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am the father of a teenage daughter with degenerative hearing loss, she is slowly losing her hearing from natural or hereditary causes. Her hearing is now slightly below normal, however, her hearing continues to degrade on a path toward eventual severe hearing loss. I have always been an apprentice (no money) audiophile, spending just the extra attention to detail to make it right. Before it's too late I want my daughter to be able to hear the beauty of music...perfect music... Any sound I play on the SE535s is beautiful, Dust Brothers Electronica, B.B. King's Lucille, Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock, and Mozart tested very clear in all sound ranges of every instrument. We also plan to use these with an iPhone hearing aid app BioAid to tune in spoken words around her. She was thrilled to finally hear the details in music!"
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4/5 stars. Allow me to explain why. I purchased these LTD 535s back in the fall of 2014 (1 year ago from today) and despite two major design flaws I believe the sound was amazing. I owned the older model 420s where the cord came directly out from each ear piece, was permanently attached, and hung directly down. You can view them by searching Amazon or wherever for Shure SE420. Those lasted me for a very long time, so when I purchased a new pair I figured I would step up to the 535s.

I had read about the swiveling cord design and watched a couple of Youtube videos on how they worked, but when I began to use them I noticed that I could not use that swiveling action due to the fact that I wear glasses sometimes and anyone who wears glasses knows it can be an issue. Also because of the angle of the ear-piece, when they are worn in that behind the ear method the cord comes out and has to do a turn so it becomes unnecessary (in my opinion). It seems that Shure tried to do something that they saw a need for, but for me it ended up serving no purpose and is why the left piece no longer works. When they began not working I noticed that it was not straight away. That cord swiveling thing they designed makes it so it will only pick up sound when the cord it turned and sitting in a certain angle/direction. Even when they were brand new I noticed this.

The other issue I now have to deal with is the lack of a shorter version of audio cord. For some reason these headphones only come with long cords. So if you used to put the headphones in your front pocket, or clip it to your shirt/arm, you now have only the option of using a very long cord. Good luck exercising with that... Shure does not even offer a short cord to buy for these. *face palm*

So I have recently used the 2 year warranty to send the ear piece and the cord in that no longer work. We will see, and I will update this review to reflect what occurs since I take great care of my electronics and see what type of coverage Shure comes through with. I sent in the cord as well. It may be that the cord is fine and the ear-piece is just somehow broken, but I have no idea and for the money I paid I do expect satisfaction.

So until I receive my 535s fixed I will state the pros and cons below:

Pros:
Sound
Light weight
Numerous types of ear piece fittings, I use a specific one and have never had fatigue with that specific ear piece, with the exception of the cord pulling them out of my ear and having to re-insert them. :(
The sound is truly isolated. I can take a train and not hear a thing but my music (you must try each ear piece and figure out what is the best for you!)

Cons:
Swivel-design
Lack of a short cord
Sound only coming out when that swivel is sitting just right, and when walking at work I would have to readjust it repeatedly.

*Update*
I sent in my L ear piece and a cord that I believed to be broken. The cord had a movable round part from the first time using it, possibly caused by plugging it into my already broken ear piece, but I am unsure of this being the cause. After approx. 1 week I received by L ear piece back (I cannot tell if it is a new one, my original ear piece, or refurbished), and along with it came what appears to be a brand new cord.

The shipping back to me was in a small, tightly wrapped soft packaging that could have been ""smooshed"" by a larger package in transit. All that protected the ear piece was bubble wrap. For this I give Shure a thumbs down, a 1/5 stars, a wag of the finger... I sent it to them in a box with bubble wrap, but a box that would withstand weight and pressure much easier that simple bubble wrap alone. Perhaps they will consider a small hard/rigid case to send the ear pieces back in so even if the package has a larger one on top, the plastic ear piece will not become warped or broken. This may be why some people are having to return them more than once to Shure! *cough cough*

When I took the ear piece out and plugged it into the new cord I immediately noticed a snug fit, compared to the loose fit when I bought them new. It is as if the cord and ear piece actually fit correctly now, but this MIGHT be a bad thing. It will take use to figure out, not WHY, but if this helps in any way. It is nice to not have that swiveling ear-piece issue anymore. When I place them inside my left ear, they STAY where I put them! :) If this was intentional then I give Shure a tip of the hat, if not then perhaps it is still something to consider. Over time it will loosen, but the current fit on the returned L ear-piece is far better then the loosey-goosey fit from when they were new.

I just received them back so I believe that only time will help divulge or assist with making noticeable any issues, but so far they seem to work and the ""better"" fit of the cord has me happy. The only issue now is that the R ear piece is as loose as it always was, so I believe the cord is the same and perhaps the ear piece has somehow changed (model change, or during repair). Again I am unsure of this being bad or good from a standpoint of being ""properly repaired,"" but the fit seems much better for use.

I will still keep the rating for these at a 4/5 because of the swiveling flaw and the lack of a short cord (including no after-market option even!), but my initial impression was an quick, honored repair from Shure!

**Final update. It has been a while since I received my headphone back and I have had no problems. The sound is fine and the swiveling design sucks, but I have no loss of sound when it occurs. I assume then, that my first bud was bad or something occured that I was no aware of such as someone dropping something on them when my back was turned. I care for my electronics like noone else I know... Anyways, Sure backed up the warrantly promise they make, they were replaced, and I have had no problems since. I only hope they do not include the swiveling ear design in the future. :)"

From reading reviews i was worried the base might be lacking. Not the case for me at all, lows still kick, and rumble like they did with my se215's.

2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 535 to replace my old SCL5 which had its cables damaged.
I decided to buy a superior one, since I was already satisfied with my old ones and my job as a drummer is getting way more serious.
For the higher price, compared to the 425 (replacer for SCL5 which I also have tested), I expected more sound definition with the triple drive feature, and a more robust frame and wires.
This doesn't mean the phones are bad. At all! They are awesome, just like my old SCL5. I've been using the 535 on concerts and they fulfill my needs. And maybe my ears aren't so well trained to hear the difference between them.
But, for my purposes, maybe I could have bought the 425 and saved some cash."

4,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE535 to replace an old pair of UE Super.fi 5 pros. The SE535 have outstanding balance and bass that does not cover up the more subtle parts of the music. I especially like listening to electronic and live music on them. FLAC quality live music really shines.

The cable is well constructed and the proprietary connector between the earbuds and the cable seems nice and secure. The cable is rather long, but that isn't anything that can't be fixed by looping it around my back or iPhone and because the cable is detachable I am not as concerned about the cable breaking due to being wrapped up all the time."
5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been known to spend some money on audio equipment in the past. These were recommended from a musician/engineering friend in NY, and he warned me that they were not cheap. So what. The sound is better out of these buds than my way-more-expensive speaker set-up in my home, and they go with me everywhere. The best speakers you will ever buy."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are absolutley amazing. They provide you with so many different ear piece fittings that I'm sure they will fit just as amazingly for you as they do for me.

7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In order to get the full potential these ear phones provide, you must ensure you get a good fit. Had to go through the supplied sleeves to obtain the ones that provided a good fit. Once you get the perfect fit you will be awed by the detail and clarity with full tonal range. I am enjoying music all over again hearing the instruments that were muddled in the back ground.
I had to convince myself to order these as replacement for my old E455s that were begining to fall apart because of the cost. It is true they are worth the cost. You must ensure you get the correct fit to get the full benefit and your music will sound new all over again."
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Long story short - Years ago, I took some of CD's into Audio Perfection here in the Twin Cities. As I listened, I remember the feeling of being able to spatially locate each instrument in the room - eyes closed, just using my ears and the perfect sound being emiited from the quarter of a million dollar sound system in front of me.

Well, 15 years later, with an $800 Ipad, those same CD's now converted to lossless music files and my new pair of Bronze Shure 535's in my ears, I got to relive the experience.

I had some serious buyers regret when I finally hit enter and saw the 'Thank-you your order has been placed!' and thinking to myself.. wtf did I just spend $450 on?

Well 2 weeks in and I can't relate how much I regret NOT buying these years ago.

PROS: see above

CONS: OK.. not really a con here.. but The music is so spatially accurate, I feel a bit unnerved at times. Similar to the Uncanny Valley robotic principle - When robots look so much like humans that it makes one uncomfortable to be near them. The music doesn't feel as though is coming in from the phones, but rather from where the instruments would be if the musicians were in the room with me. Additionally, The isolation of the black foam tips is near perfect thus blocking out all external environmental sound - lucky I guess as I've read reviews where that isn't always the case.

If you were like me an waffling on the price - think of it this way - A decent entry level pair of speakers from a high end manufacturer will run you at least $1000/pair and you can't bring those floor-standing boxes with you on a plane - nuff said."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these same earphones twice. They are rock solid amazing. The sound is incredible and the quality is superb. They have taken a lot of use and wear but they still work great.
0,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones
1,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great set of earphones-The best I have tried so far compared to W40,W50 and the horrible Etymotic ER4.
The sound quality and noise isolation is excellent and I had a chance to try this on a commercial flight.
I have decided to return it not based on sound quality but based on discomfort and ease of use. First of all, its a big and heavy earphone. I feel its very bulky. Second, The loop around the ear has different cable which is very thick . It is made so as it fit it around the ear contours very tight. It was hard for me to adjust without using two hands.Every time I remove the earphones, putting it back so as to adjust it around the ear was a cumbersome task.
Third, I went for a run and I feel this was heavy, even if you don't take the included volume adjuster. Fourth, for the 500$ price range I expect a mic and a remote to use with IPhone. It comes with an airline adapter, carrying pouch and different ear tips. I have decided to return Shure 535V and try the Westone W30 which I got for 330$."
2,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never experienced better music quality without the need of batteries to shut out external noise. The only Thing I have noted after long use is that the cable gets green due to moisture conditions, the sound becomes then unclear when the cable has achieved this condition when the cable is in movement, but replacement cables can be bought which is very nice, some of the replacement cables give even better sound quality."

5,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the very first review I've written, for any product....and I'm going to keep it pretty simple. These headphones are wildly expensive; but if you're interested in hearing and appreciating every single thing about the music you love, then these are the last set of headphones you'll ever purchase. I found them to be far more comfortable than they look and the sound is simply spectacular! It is the next best thing to actually being there. It's easy to get a bit of buyers remorse about spending $500 on headphones but after the first ten seconds of the first song I heard using them, I knew that it is one of the best (technology) investments I've made."
6,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was fortune enough to be able to buy both the se425 and se535 to compare. The se425's are outstanding reference in ear monitors. You will get decent bass in pop songs and overall will be happy. The se535's are better with bass and sound stage. Ironically the 535's are actually louder the the se425s so don't worry about an amp. You definitely don't need it. The sound stage is the major difference. The 535's just envelope you and you can hear everything. The 425's are good but just not there compared to the 535 from a soundstage. Remember the recording is everything. You will not get bass from the Beatles but if you put any modern pop song the 425 will sound great. All in all if you can afford the 535 just get them. I bought them used for 389 on Amazon. Thought that was a good deal to get the better pair.

And yes I tried putting one of ear ear buds in my ear to tell the difference. It's dumb. You can't so tell so don't bother trying. All I can say is that with the 425 I played with the EQ. The 535 I didn't. Buy them."
7,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is wonderful. The clarity - superb! Great condition for used in-ears; however, it was shipped with used covers still attached. Ewe. (Minus one star)"
8,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earphones, period.
I used to have the Bose earphones and thought that they were good, and thought that they were just a bit better than the Apple earphones, then I was looking for an earphone that I could use comfortably on plane rides as the main usage and needed something with noise cancellation or isolation.

Once I tried the SE535, with the correct foam plug for good fit, I was hooked and realized how much better the music listening experience on the go can be when you make the investment.

The downside....now, I can't use any other headset anymore..."
9,Shure SE535-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Triple High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these new earphones. I bought them to replace a pair of older Shure's that had developed cracks and frays in the wiring. Very pleased overall.
