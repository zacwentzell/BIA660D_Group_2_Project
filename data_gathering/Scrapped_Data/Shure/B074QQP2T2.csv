0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Right to point, these headphones sound great. A very nice neutral approach with good clarity throughout. They are not bass heavy, if you are looking for that you will be disappointed. My criteria was a good sub $100 dollar IEM setup to plug right into my iphone. No amp, no dac. Just a nice sounding set of in ears I can take with me wherever I go. These deliver right on the money. Looks leave a little to be desired, but I am buying for sound not looks. I tried a pair of BeyerDynamic in ears in the same dollar range and these sound better in my opinion. For sub $100 dollars, I would put these up against anything-- provided you are looking for something neutral / flat.

My one complaint, the fit. It could just be my ears, but I could not get these to stay in no matter what I did or how I positioned them. I switched to the smallest tip and could feel and hear them continually losing pressure then sliding out. I had originally thought being forced to wear these up and over the ear would help, but it didn't. I was about to return them because no matter how great they sound, if they don't stay in my ear it's pointless. I had read good things on Comply replacement foam tips and ordered a pair of the T100 isolation series. That made all the difference, they are stuck like glue now and I can actually enjoy listening without feeling the IEM's fall out. So to summarize, fantastic neutral sound, but buyer beware if you have smaller ear canals the tips might be difficult to work in and hold. There is a great fix out there, but it does require spending another 15-20 dollars for a three pack of replacement tips. I've seen some BeyerDynamic IEM shipping with Comply tips as replacement, might be something for Shure to consider-- I almost returned them because of how poor the stock ones fit me."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great. I've avoided earbuds before because I've never been happy with the bass response. I have to say the bass response is great on this headphones, the only trick is to have them fit properly inside the ear. It takes a bit to select the right sleeve (three sizes provided) and to get the cable looped correctly around the ear, but once fit properly the sound is fantastic. The mic works perfectly on my android device. I'm surprised about the sound isolation. I think it is better than the active noise cancelling on the Bose QC headphones. I've even worn these in a concert as earplugs.

I'm taking one star because after a year of use the rubber cover on the back of the earbuds is peeling and breaking apart.

After using these I bought the SE215, but I stull use the SE112m as my day to day headphones."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible earphones, listened to the se112 with the Shure SE846 ISOLATING FOAM TIPS, I could not detect a difference in sound quality only that the se112 had to be turned up a notch or two. I changed these earphones back and fourth at least 20 times. These earphones are the door to other Shure earphones and products, maybe that is why they sound so good. You can buy Shure foam tips, plus comply p series will fit your se112s. Most of the reviews would be 5 stars if foam tips were used. After being smashed into a narrow cylinder and then placed into the ear they expan to form a perfect isolating seal, making the se112 sound 50% better. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SILICONE TIPS THAT CAME WITH YOUR EARPHONES."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112 with wireless cable is pretty darn good. The battery life is stellar as well as the charge time, I never had an issue with it dying when I did not expect it. The sound quality is what you would expect, fairly entry-level. In comparison with the SE215, the lows are a bit lacking (the 215's are known to be a tad bass heavy) with not as much sub-bass extension. The high's and mids however are fairly spot on compared to the 215's, with the 215's maybe sounding a bit clearer, if barely. The wireless implementation Shure created is also quite nice, I had no issues with connection and I could go quite far before it started cutting out.

If you are used to how well the SE215's fit in your ear these are a little strange to get use to, they are much more round and not so fitted for an ear, that being said they still fit fine and won't fall out, the SE 215's do have a superior fit in my opinion though.

My only gripe with these IEM's are that the cable does not detach like most Shure models, which sacrifices the durability and options that the higher end models grant you.The cable is quite rugged though, I thought mine were dead after I snagged them in the rolling seat of my car, but to my surprise when I finally yanked them out there was not a scratch on them nor was there a detached wire internally.

So if you can afford the price increase to snag the 215's with this cable I would go for it, but this is still a quite nicely priced offering from Shure."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Shure’s shredded along the right and left cords after 5 years of very heavy use. I hope to not be as hard on these.
The sound isolation is very good. It enables me to not have to blast the volume in order to keep surrounding noises at bay. For an example, at half volume on my iPhone, I can’t hear the usually loud music at Starbucks. But without audio, the headphones don’t block much sound at all.
There’s a chincer that keeps the cord snug to your jaw. The volume controls are easy to use by feel and the mic is a good distance from your mouth. Thought I do notice that many people like it practically in their mouths, the mic picks up your voice just fine where it is.

I like a bit more of a bass response and these give me all the bass I need without blowing out my eardrums. The stereo is clear and gives your music plenty of depth. I’m very satisfied with my Shures and hope to have them for years to come."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because of the reviews and because they're from Shure...but I am thoroughly disappointed. If I were to draw a frequency response graph for these, it might look like a bell curve that peaks in the mid-highs and leaves highs and lows in the dust. Lyrics sound...ok on these. Certain musical instruments like clarinets sound pretty good while warmer instruments like a piano or drums sound gross.

Shure is known for their legendary dynamic microphones. Give the SE112-GR a pass."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile, so if that's what you're looking for in a review, you might want to skip this one. From a practical standpoint, I really like these and struggled between 4 stars and 5 stars. These are my go-to headphones when I'm in an environment with any kind of background noise ... mostly being in an airplane or on my motorcycle (I wear a half helmet and have stock pipes on one HD and slip-ons on the other one). The sound is great enough for me for both music and audio books and, because of the isolation, I don't have to listen at full volume to hear it well. The controls are large enough to easily operate when wearing gloves. The cord is longer than most, making it easy to connect to my phone mounted on the gas tank or when it's sitting in the seatback pocket on the plane. The cord seems very durable and doesn't tangle. I'd give these 5 stars, but after several hours, they begin to get a little uncomfortable and I need to take a break."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the loudest ear-buds I've ever owned. The bass is solid as are the highs. The mids actually sound pretty good too and Im kinda picky. Im not rich so I cant afford the $400.00 pair of Bose or Klepschs. I do like to drool on my screen at them though. I have had a few nice pair though. I reckon its safe to say that I buy a decent pair just about once a year, come motorcycle season. The most I've ever spent is $250 on a pair of wireless Beats. Ive also spent $20 on a pair of SkullKandys. So far, these are my favorites. I can't remember how much I spent ($59.99) on them just now but Im sure they weren't cheap. Still, they rock and I like my music loud so I can hear it over my bike, which is also kinda loud. Anyway, if you're on the fence, stop thinking and just get 'em. You wont be disappointed."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing, and not just for the price, they're just amazing period. As an audiophile and musician of many years, I can't believe sound this solid is available at such a low price. I remember paying close to 300 dollars for a pair of older EC3s and this pair in the SE112 is actually better. It's imperative to get a right seal in the ear and it does need to sit deeper in the ear canal, so it may not be for everyone. But for those who are willing to take the time to learn how to seat these buds the right way are going to be treated to nuances and dynamics that other earphones in this price range just won't be able to deliver. There's a quite long break-in period, both to the drivers and to your brain. It's a phenomenon that I can't truly describe, but once the burn-in period is established. They'll treat you good."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've hadn't these for 2 months now, and say without reservation that these are the best headphones I've ever owned and one of the best purchases I've ever made.

I bought these because I had become frustrated with the sound quality of all the headphones I had. I hated the crackling I could hear when I streamed music (my primary form of listening) and I also felt like I wasn't getting enough outside sound blocked which prevented me from being able to hear the different levels of bass and treble.

I knew that these problems would be easier to fix with over-ear headphones, but not only do I look goofy with those on, they're also just way too bulky.

I fully expected to have to pay upwards of $120 for a pair of Beats or Bose earbuds, but after doing a little research I stumbled upon these and decided to go for it.

They have exceeded all expectations, solved all problems, and are the only headphones I will ever use. They completely block outside sound (so much so that I slept soundly through a 6 hour flight.) The quality is INCREDIBLE.

I absolutely recommend these to anyone even mildly frustrated with their headphones."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my Sister as a birthday present. I had the SE425s for about a year before they fell out of my pocket one day. Before that I used a 200 series set for about three years. After trying these I have to say that this particular set of headphones is an OK value but I would recommend saving a little longer and buying the 2 series or higher. The jump is pretty noticeable. All Shure headphones are a lifesaver, though, if you use public transportation or fly a lot. You can really turn the world off and relax. If you're like me and use headphones daily it's easy to justify the price.

I used both of my sets while doing extensive cardio and never had any issues with sweat damaging them like people say. I would only caution that replacement cords are expensive in the upscale models. I can't wait until I've set aside enough money to justify getting another set of 425s."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these, it was clear that these fit a lot differently than the in ear buds that I'd been using before this. The fit is VERY tight, and they do seal which lead to some issues with ear pressure that I had to suffer through for a while, but the sound quality was good, and isolation was fantastic until about a month ago. After about 4 months of regular use one of the channels started to buzz a bit, and I've been in the unenviable position of having to twist the cable and position it 'just so' to avoid crackling and cutting in and out on the right channel.

I could forgive the comfort issues due to the sound quality and isolation, but it just was a constant struggle to find the balance between ear pressure comfort with the seal and getting them into 'just the right position' for it not to be uncomfortable, even trying different tips nothing felt as comfortable.

The cord seemed very heavy duty, but obviously it has it's issues as after only 4 months one side is beginning to fray. Wouldn't recommend unless you can try in person and will be using these in a very mild, non-active fashion and isolation is a must."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones a year ago. I use them at work for maybe 3 hours a week average. They were great for the first 6 months and then one side stopped working and now the other side is completely disintegrating. I keep them in their own pouch in my desk and I'm gentle with them because I wanted them to last. My headphones usually last several years and for me to pay 50$ and have them fall apart within a year?! I'm pretty upset. Decent sound quality originally, but...long haul? I wouldn't waste my money again."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third time we have purchased this product. It isolates the sound well, blocks out most noise and the sound is very good for a lower cost earphone. I have used it on airplanes and it works well to block out most noise. The sound tends to the base rather than treble but it is very balanced. The controls work well and the product lasts a long time. I have had one pair for over four years and it still works just as good as new.

You can also replace the ear buds so that is a plus. Keeping them clean can be a chore if you do not keep up with it. Also, they tend to collect ear wax but that should be expected from any earphones. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for earphones."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The 112's replaced the 115's I lost while traveling. The cord quality definitely is not as great as the 115's. I have very little confidence that the cord wires will remain intact long-term. The sound quality it ok - better than low end earbuds, but not as great as the high end ones. If you consider yourself an audiophile, these are not for you.

Noise isolation and comfort are excellent. I use the foam covers with my 535's and my lost 115's, but since I purchased the 112's while away on business, I was forced to use the rubber covers... 'cause oh yeah, the 112's don't come with both like the 115's. Anyway, the rubber covers worked just as well.

If you buy these, I recommend you buy a Shure hard or soft zip case. The drawstring bag for the 112's is useless and protects the buds from nothing but dust."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good for these phones, lots of bass. In comparison with the Apple in-ear headphones, these are very difficult to use. The insulation is very stiff and the control pod hangs much lower. For me, I like to tuck the cord inside my shirt but with the Shure I have a lot hanging outside and since they are stiff it swings out in front of my face. Also, the remote is hard to use because all the buttons feel the same - meaning that when you want to pause you could easily press the volume controls."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First bought this model before about 7 years ago. Replaced it with a Shure 215 after 3 years because the wires broke apart due to wear and tear. Just bought another pair now to use at home. Still amazing sound and quality for the money.
However I would definitely recommend paying the extra $40 for the 215 which comes with kevlar braided wires and stiff wire ear loops. Both sound great and have amazing insulation. I can use these on planes or mowing the lawn and not even have to turn the volume up 1/4 of the way."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good and has all the features that I need. But I bought this only last week and every time the voice says ""battery more than 4 hours"" it turns off and seems to run out of battery immediately after. This is after 1-2 hours of of use."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received these headphones today, and they seem like they're going to be the best pair I'll have ever owned. The sound is stunning for the price, and the build quality seems to be spot on. The wiring doesn't tangle, and the connections are quite sturdy. The buttons in the mic (an optional feature) are solid and take just the right amount of force to press so you won't accidentally press them while working. The fit seems great (even though I've only had them for a few hours), and Shure recommends you wear the cord around your ear. I was weary of this at first because it seems flat-out uncomfortable to wear earbuds this way, but I was surprised to find it's actually not noticeable. The volume is also wonderful. They can be extremely loud, and so I don't need to turn my volume up on my iPhone more than halfway most of the time.

My only issue is with the volume up button. It seems to be less sensitive than the others, which makes me wonder if it will go out after a a few months. I will post any updates in the future with any issues, but I would highly recommend these.

My previous earbuds were Skullcandy Titan - Found here:

Skullcandy Titan (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

They were great, but I foresee the Shure earbuds to outperform them in sound and hopefully longevity. (The Titans were little tanks. Nothing can break those things. I had 2 pairs in 6 years)"
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these not because I am an enthusiast or a hicker and wanted something of quality to hear music, no!. I am a professional singer who performs no less than 4 times a week, casinos, clubs... One in particular is so loud, so I need something that no only work as a very good In Ear Monitor, but also a protection to my hearing. The isolation of these is so good at the point that I left them after the set to stay inside the club and have to take one out at any moment in order to hear what other people tried to scream at me. I can compare their isolating efficiency with the Bose ones.... At 75% less the price? Good"
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earphones I have ever had. I listen to classical music on my iPod, and I'm fussy about the earphone fit and quality."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not blown away by sound quality considering Shure's reputation, but the noise cancelling is superb."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid pair of earbuds. Mids and highs are crisp, clear. Lows are a bit muffled. Pops out of my ear if I am wearing when eating. Also, constantly slides out when only have one ear bud in regardless of positioning, etc."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The toughest earphones in this price range....
I've had them for 6 months and work in a rough environment. They blow away skull candy, (only lasted 2 months), NRG, (one month), These still function and sound like new.

That was then, the quality has changed. Shorts in the wires after 3 months. They used to last years. My use has not changed, the quality did."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earbuds. The sound is really good and they are very comfortable to wear. Thank you!
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are amazing!!! Completely cancel out sound. Even on the plane! Sometimes I even just use them for earplugs on the plane too. I bought another set for a family member.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well made and easy to use.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound. Not as good as an older set of Shure earbuds that I've had for years. Good value for the price.
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, especially for the price."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound that comes out of these doesn't sound that great to me, the headphones that came with my iPod sound much better as do the $15 dollar pair of sport headphones i've got. I wasn't expecting anything great, but i didn't think it'd sound worse than the cheap headphones i've already got. The instructions say that if there seems to be a lack of low frequency bass to try another tip, i've gone back and forth between all 3 several times and tried positioning the headphones in different positions but the bass always sounds muffled.

But that's not really why i bought these and even if the sound wasn't perfect i could live with that. I was really hoping to be able to use these to listen to music while mowing lawns without blowing my ears out, but these really don't block out much sound at all. Reading the reviews for the SE215 i saw that people were complaining that it blocked TOO much sound, that's what i wanted! Silence enough to listen to an audiobook or podcast on a lawn mower. Seeing that they were both rated at 37dB i figured i'd pick these up so i wouldn't feel as bad about breaking a $100 pair of headphones (as is bound to happen) and i'm not sure if i made the right choice. It could just be that none of the tips/sleeves fit my ears quite right (to notice any sort of ""noise isolation"" i have to really push the earphones in there). I haven't tried them out on the mower yet, but i don't have high hopes.

They do feel well-built and sturdy, especially the main cord, my main grudges are the sound quality and sound isolation.

UPDATE: I tested these out on the lawn mower and was pleasantly surprised that i could (reasonably) understand an audiobook, though i still needed the volume on max. It's not exactly what i wanted as my ears are still going to be ruined, but they fare better than i thought they would at first, maybe because the sound goes directly into my ear and comes out louder? Another thing to add is that when wearing them for extended periods of time (ie. >30 minutes), since they have to be pushed in really deeply for the best sound and to block out outside noise, my ear starts to feel sore despite the tip i use.

UPDATE 2016: I ended up getting used to them and the sound they produce, when they finally broke a few months ago (right around 2 years after i purchased them) i must say i was pretty upset and i think i went through the same adjustment period to get used to my cheap earphones again. I'm not sure that i'd buy them again, but i did end up appreciating them more than i did at first."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat disappointed with this purchase. Some reviews have indicated this to be the best sounding buds under $100 right now, I'm not sure I would agree. The low to mid range is acceptable for the most part, with reasonable extension into the lowest octaves. The low range (>300Hz) has a reasonably flat response with good dynamics, and isn't over-accentuated and boomy which seems to be the norm in most headphones today. There is some noticeable distortion at higher levels, but the isolation is good enough I usually don't feel the need to push them that hard. Midrange response is also acceptable, but above 4K is where everything goes to hell really quickly. The sibilance of a vocalist, the bite of a snare, the string twang of an accoustic guitar or the clash of a cymbal will all sound just really, really wrong. Lots of distortion combined with a rising response just sounds horrible. There are highs, lots of highs, but there is just no definition to it all.

Otherwise, the build quality is pretty good, they feel like the should hold up for a while. The volume control does not work with my Moto X (2014), but the mic and mute button is all I really want."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds good but the product description is wrong. These are NOT wireform behind the ear. This is false advertising.
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't like the sound quality. Not enough base for my preference.
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are overall great earphones. I got them to replace my Sennheiser i300s and I chose these specifically because they're supposed to be rugged, especially where the cord meets the jack, which is where my headphones tend to break after a couple of months. Judging by the amount of plastic at that join these should not have a problem there. However, the jack doesn't stay seated in my phone very well. I have an iPhone 6 plus and They way my phone sits in my pocket the cord tends to get pulled out whenever I walk.. or sit down... or stand up... or just put it in my pocket. When I try to put the phone in my back pocket the cord is basically at its limit, because it is about six inches too short.

TL;DR
Pros-
comfortable
they at least look sturdy
good audio quality

cons-
Doesn't stay in headphone jack very well
short cord"
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these earphones. The sound is excellent and they fit comfortably. I purchased a second pair for work so I would never be without them. Great earphones for the price!
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,exceeded my expectations. Now I can work out at the gym in peace. It does really isolate the noise. Not sure why so many complain about it being uncomfortable. I thought it was comfortable.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these were decent until my dog chewed them up and I had to go to a backup, cheaper SKULL CANDY, the skull candy had way better bass, and just as good on the mid and high."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!!
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love the quality of the product. I would highly recommend these if you what a good pair of ear buds and don't mind spending a bit for their quality.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband is a headphone snob! But I think I scored on these. He said they are great for cancelling out extra noise which is great because he wears them at work and the gym. Also he loves the sound quality and remote feature.

sound is nice and clear for the price range"
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great but the model before em had more bass & a better cable. They wanna charge you four times as much for the fancy ones the started making if you want decent bass. Theyre probably better but I'm not paying $300 for friggin earbuds. These have decent sound & isolate sound enough to jam your tunes during high speed motorcycle rides and high caliber rifle fire. (Just not at the same time ok?)

Be safe; you cant hear w these in.

KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!"
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent bang for the buck, great sound quality. After going through countless lower quality earbuds, this is a welcome change! Having to loop the cord around your ears takes some getting used to, but it's still worth it. My only complaint would be that the (very sturdy) cord could be a bit longer."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but the only lasted six months of light usage. Can't really recommend when they're not for daily use."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love my earphones. I work in a bullpen style office so I always have a hard time getting some quiet time to work. These do the trick. I put them in, turn on my music, and voilà, I hear no one."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use for music and they sound pretty good for small earphones.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked these up help me downsize / streamline my travel stuff. They were intended to replace my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, which I use(d) for travel, but they were a bit big.
At the same time, I wanted good sound as well as the ability to talk on the phone ( I ordered the inline controls and mic option).
These buds seemed to be the best option for the money, checking all the boxes of portability, good sound, good isolation and a quality build (at least on paper).
A week in and I love these buds. The isolation is excellent and the sound well above average.
I have several sets of higher end headphones (Sony, Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser) and these rank up there in terms of sound quality.
Specifically, I find the sound more on the neutral side (which I like) and a bit less pronounced highs than other earbuds / headphones. This doesn't bother me, as it keeps an extended listen from being fatiguing, but did want to mention as the only ""watch out"". So many mixes and headphones are oriented against the ""smile"" (bass and treble boost) that people are used to this type of sound profile.
I listened with the included silicone ear buds, but replaced with Shure's memory foam buds. For me, this works very well, and the cost of this ""upgrade"" is negligible for the added comfort and isolation provided. That said, the included buds work fine as well."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a gift and the recipient really likes these. Accurate and affordable audio in your ears!!!!
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,All ride A Harley Davidson. It's kind of loud. I have had a hard time finding earbuds that did not need to be turned up loud. These are great
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Within a few used, the right ear phone quit working."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. The sound isolation is perfect I can't hear a thing when the music is playing and even when there isn't any music playing they provide some sound isolation.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bass is not as described, it is lacking. I am returning."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones/monitors.
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed with this purchase. Worked great for about 6 months until left earphone suddenly stopped working. You'd expect much better durability and quality at this price-point.
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great buds for musicians on a budget. As a drummer a get a great low punchy kick sound with a good even mix.
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,good earphones
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and I am happy that I waited a few months to write this review.

First off, I am the type of guy who has never owned an expensive pair of earphones/headphones. I prefer to own versatile, inexpensive earphones between $10 - $30 that can be used for morning/evening commutes, the gym, etc. So when my latest pair of cheap earphones broke, I figured I would get something a little more expensive that would last a long time, but not outrageously expensive (like Beats).

When I was looking for a new pair, I did my research. I wanted something affordable that would last long, be versatile in usage, and give me crystal clear sound. These highly rated Shures were within my top three choices and ultimately, these were the ""lucky"" earphones I decided on.

I was excited when I received the package containing these Shures. However, excitement soon turned into frustration. No matter what you read in the reviews or in the instructions, these earphones do NOT fit SECURELY in your ears. They have an awkward fit and the slightest pull on the cord will cause them to fall out or, at the very least, cause the cord wrapping around your ear to fall out. Thus, these are terrible earphones for the gym or for when you're out running. If you're using these in less active scenarios, then they should stay on.

In terms of the sound quality, I actually have to give these Shures some credit. Perhaps it's because I am used to cheaper earphones, but I felt like there was a very solid balance in sound. I like all types of music but these were great for deep house, folk music, classic rock, pop, indie...just about everything! I have been to some of the top clubs around the world with some of the most sophisticated sound systems, and this reminded me of those experiences of being immersed in top-notch sound quality.

So I was able to get past the awkward fitting and enjoy the sound quality of these headphones, but this was short-lived. Today, on 7/12, the left earbud blew out and I am livid. Although it's only been a few months, Amazon will not accept a return for these. I am hoping that I can contact Shure and they can do something about this. This is not the type of thing that should happen to a $50 pair of earphones. If no one is able to help resolve this issue, then I will never buy a pair of Shures again."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good but not as good as the Klipsch headphones they replaced. Unlike the Klipsch, these are very durable and I expect them to have a long service life. Overall these earbuds are excellent for the price."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,The wireless headphones are just as described.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them. I had the ones without the microphone which are good too. Good value for high quality headphones. I like the microphone because I am very often using my smart phone and I like to use the headphones to answer calls.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Bose I own both half the price these will not disappoint.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones were great - until the left side stopped working about 6 months after the purchase.
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor fit and annoying road feedback while running upon after foot strike. These earphones are only usable when you are stationary - not what I would have expected at this price point
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds for the price. The sound is excellent .
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product.
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product but a bit pricey for earbuds. The bass on this is simply thumping and crisp.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simple headphones, but extremely well made, perfect audio, and after a year of warehouse use, they're still 100%. For the price. These will go a long way! Once they break, I'll make sure to buy these again!"
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,good stuff
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"didn't workout for me. Happy with Panasonic now.
Of course Panasonic cant bit the sound quality. But much lightweight and comfortable than Shure."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Fit nicely in ears. Music sounds incredible.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good, the build correct, but after 2 weeks using it, a short circuit in the cable makes this pair of earphones a mono, single ear piece (which changes depending on mood of the day). So yeah, it could very well be just this unit, but after two weeks, the fact it's broken is just ground for a 1 star review. Also, I'm now out of the return window"
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The ear buds sound ok but not as good as my Scosche earphones. The volume control doesn't work w/ my Android phone. It was not evident in the product description that it was for only iPhones. The length of the wire is also too short.
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is decent. The cord seems to be a bit stiff and is also a bit short from the microphone volume control device to the earbuds. It could've been a couple of inches longer. Overall, not bad for the price."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones!
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass, cancels outside noise, and good price."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound from little package. i was impressed.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,best headphones for the price
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rugged with decent sound which is what I need.
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Prefer the SE215, the volume controls are not compatible with Android, though the pause/play button is so its decent enough."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It has a decent sound if you are listening to certain genres, but if what you are listening to has any bass, this product fails completely."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very clear sound with a good amount of base. I don't get any of that annoying rubbling sound from when the cord touches things which is great!
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality of build on these was much better than others (typical of Shure audio products). Wire seems higher quality and slightly heavier duty. However, the quality of the sound (especially bass and midrange) was not as good as my Sennheiser CX300II or my Sennheiser MM30i which cost less. The mic and controls seem to work as well as the original iPhone earbuds that came with my iPhone 5C and compare well with the Sennheiser MM30i. Plug is the TRRS type made to work with iPhones. I like these and use them, but prefer Sennheiser for sound. Wonder what the higher end Shure's sound like. Expected better from Shure."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I couldn't wait to get these earphones. Based on the reviews I was expecting something different and the brand shure has me excited. I honestly thought I was going to be blown away with the sound quality but when I listened to them they were ok. The bass was ok the highs and mids are really good but nothing special. I compared these earphones with my Samsung galaxies earphones that came with the phone and they seem to sound the same.. not much difference just a slightly more clear from the shure earphones.. but that's it I don't think they are worth the $50 price.. they are haRd to keep in ear when I was at work they kept falling off ,and yes I was wearing the correct way the instructions say.. I think I might return..."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"With optional triple flange ear tips (purchased separately), secure and comfortable. Heavy duty cable. I like them."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They certainly don't go anywhere, a bit noise cancelling, but also a little uncomfortable. Still the best ones I've used."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good one ! It is durable and sounds very good. There's a tool to remove wax and clean it up.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them, great at gym very good on an airplane, although not noise canceling if they're in the ear properly they eliminate almost all the noise around you on the airplane, including those annoying people that want to talk for 9 hours on a 9.5 hour flight."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like these a lot. This is my second pair and I will biuy them again.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cord is thick and heavy. Not great for working out because the earbuds won't stay in place.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,These being Shure lower end ear buds still are better than most others.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely amazing sound from these babies. Better than my Bose soundtrue over-ear headphones. Rich bass and engulfing overall sound experience. Love it!
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because i wanted a nicer quality earbud style earphone with a built-in mic for skype calling. I ignored most of the negative reviews before buying because there seemed to be a lot of people who seemed happy with these earphones. Straight out of the box these earphones began having problems. On my first use the person on the receiving end of my call said they heard a constant hiss on my end. I wasn't able to hear the hiss from the buds but i would rotate the jack in the port and that seemed to make it go away initially. One month after using it now it doesn't matter how many times i rotate the jack in port but the hissing stays. My family told me they could live with it in the end. Now just another month of very mild use and the mic is completely dead.
Either the mute function is stuck on,or a dead mic, but no audio can be heard during calls on their end. This is a huge shame because i was wanted this type of earphone but there aren't too many good ones out in the market. These lasted me shortly under three months.
These seem pretty robust but have terrible function. Look at Sennheiser's MM30G"
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that the earpieces are very hard to remove. They sound great, I mostly listen to podcast with them."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are amazing. Clear crisp highs, great sound reproduction. I bought these when my SE-310s crapped out (after 5 years use). I use them about three hours per day during the week. No comfort problems at all!"
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"MEH. I've come to realize that ear-phone marketing is basically blowing smoke.

The sound is OK but I am not an audiophile. It works for me. How important is the bass, etc when you are working out? You should be focusing on the workout.

These may be more solid due to use of thicker wires but they still don't last. I work out with them (run mostly) but the left ear bud/wire is already dead!! They are also not the most comfortable as you need to ram in the ear buds to get them to stay in place.

In other words, don't pay a lot of money for any ear phone...they will break."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Volume control did not work with my iPhone though.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too big for my ears even with the smallest size of ear buds. They never stay in my ears. Also the sound quality is nothing to swoon over
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,not bad
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Push these into your ear and nearly all surrounding sound is blocked. The microphone is great. Talk on phone in the car without getting background noise.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick delivery, sounds great."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift to grandson who received the Bluetooth Adapter. Need I say any more? 😄
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,not at all disappointed by these
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have figured out how these in-ear headphones should sit in my ear (basically the whole earphone is cradled by my outer ear) the fit seems perfect, they stay put and I barely notice they are in. I usually use Bose quiet comfort over-the-ear headphones, so I didn't expect much from these in terms of sound isolation. That said, I have been pleasantly surprised at how well they do isolate sound. The sound quality is way better than the default earbuds that came with my iPhone 6s, but probably not audiophile quality. This product is an exceptional value. I encourage anyone who is not looking for ""head rattling"" bass to give these a try."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,my favorite ear buds ever. Warranty is great. Very sad they got stolen.
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice. Comfy, lows mids and highs are all balanced. I would give a 5 star, but when I got mine there was buzzing in the right earbud."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's good buy it, seriously good sound quality. Though it is tricky to get in your ear properly."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming in every respect. Should be about 1/2 the price. Don't get sucked into the brand unless you purchase the high end.
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product! Really isolates outside noise. Good bass and sound definition.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. Good deal for the money.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are terrible. They are uncomfortable in the ear, fall out all the time (even after trying the different earpieces) and the heavy duty cable is constantly pulling them out of my ears. On top of the comfort issues the sound is no better than any pair of free earbuds I've ever gotten with a phone or music player purchase."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent for the price
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic while right beside a drummer. Sound isolation is great.
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good. Lacking a little on low end response !
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So a lotta people been talking trash about this headphone and the fit any everything, if you do your research or even read or look into the information they give you right in your face (like the video) it will tell you that the cable is an over the ear type design (a lot of people say that isn't comfortable, I personally find it more comfortable for me to wear these incorrectly). And the sound for me is good, better than my apple headphones that came with my iPhone 5c, and when those finally started to wear after over a year of use I switched so some Samsung headphones I borrowed without permission from my family member, and those were pretty bad with my iPhone. These recently made it to my house so I don't know how long they will last but they seem pretty sturdy and can get some good use especially since I do a lot of active stuff where I listen to music and these already hold better than the previous earphones."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Highs and mids arnt bad. Not impressed with the low bass. Distorts when I blast them and they aren't very comfortable and my ears hurt after 15 minutes.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Blocks outside noises too.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,sounded like a tiny plastic chamber.
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are fine nothing great just ok.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the price. Good at noise cancelling and good sound quality.
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these today. I'm a musician, and I say the sound quality is excellent. As for the sound isolation, I went out and stood next to the wood chipper our yard guy was working with, and it was barely there at all. Having worn them for about an hour now, I'm still quite comfortable with them in the ears.

I suppose the $300 Bose active phase-cancelling items would be even better, but at the price I'm really happy, and am anticipating a transatlantic flight with little jet-noise fatigue. Butt fatigue, another story."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchasing these Shure earphones, it became the very first Shure product I ever owned. The quality is top-notch in terms of materials and the sound itself. I've seen these earphones resists hard tugs and pulls. I've also accidentally sat and slept on these; came out unharmed.

Grading the sound could be difficult because everyone has their own personal preference, but in my opinion the sound is quite clear and contains a decent amount of bass. Though, the lows are not so great.

One major downsides is that every time I'm on the move and I'm wearing these earphones, I could hear a lot of cable noise whenever it makes contact with anything."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I am very much into music. These were amazing headphones while they worked. But after two months of use the aux jack became finicky. I would have to hold it in place in order to get sound out of both ears. Then it escalated. I would have to hold the aux jack just to get sound in one ear. I contacted Amazon because asking about the warranty, after a week they responded. They sent me a link TO THE PRODUCT PAGE. After following the prompts I was told to contact the same email that had told me to go to the product page. I loved these headphones, but I'm upset with the quality and how unhelpful Amazon has been."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have very good and accurate sound after you work them in for a few days. When they first arrived, and the equalizer on my iPhone was of after a reset. There was absolutely no base, once you turn on the equalizer and let the low frequency burn in over a few days. The base is fairly accurate and the sound stage is clear after a few days. The center remote Play, FFW, RW, Call Answer button, needed to be worn in for a few days, it was not easy to get it to fast forward and RW, right out of the box. It would jump ahead two songs or just Stop and Play. After a few days the contacts loosened up and work smoothly and accurately now. Overall I am happy with the build quality.

Pros:
Sturdy thick cables, Nice size remote, tangle resistant cable, great sound after low frequency burn in.

Cons:
Takes a few days for the low frequency to burn in, the middle remote button needs to be worked in regarding sensitivity. They can be worn with the cable over the ear for a secure fit, or hanging down from the ear.

Overall, I recommend this to someone that listens various types of music."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm pretty hard on my headphones - and being deaf, I expect a ton of volume. I'm now on my third set of these - though none have broken, I've lost them. They take a beating & blast a great sound. Never had issue with the plug or earbuds.

There is a small amount of 'rubbing noise ' from the cord on your body that transmits into the headpiece. But for the mid range price, that's to be expected."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not an expert, but I appreciate what these earbuds have to offer. Quality construction and great design. The sound quality lives up to what I expected. The bass is balanced out nicely with the highs and mids. At $99, these seem reasonably priced."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! These sound great and block out most noise. I added the special silicone tips specific to this model. I will be buying more as IEMs (in-ear-monitors) for a church and also for a private band both using the MyMix personal monitor system. It sounds great playing bass. I'm sure they would do well while playing drums too.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The buds didn't fit my ears well. They come with three sizes which to me didn't vary much. Functionality is fine.

A year later I've decided I really like them. The fit is different from other buds in that the wire drape over your ears from behind. I've gotten used to that and now prefer that type of fit to wires hanging directly down from my ears. The wires themselves and heavy and do not kink or tangle."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I still love these earbuds, but I did have problems with them coming loose a lot on stage. I tried some other types in the same price range, but none compared in sound quality. Then I discovered COMPLY memory foam universal earbud tips. I ordered a pair of the T100 isolation tips and now not only do I have even better sound isolation but they don't fall out any more either!

Original review:
I'm very impressed by the fit and how tough the cord feels, and the noise isolation is great. I use these for monitoring my vocals on stage, they function both as ear plugs and monitors. I was using some decent sony earbuds for this before, but they never blocked enough noise to keep my ears well protected. I haven't compared these to more expensive earbuds, but compared to the sony, sennheiser, and philips buds i've used in the $30-$40 range they sound just as good. I love shure products, and I've found that even their lower end stuff is always well made."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just lost my first pair, which I had for a year so now I am back to purchase another pair. These earbuds are perfect. I usually have issues with earbuds falling out of my ear if I move at all but these actually stay in. The sound isolation is exactly what I need while I am studying, and the quality of sound makes listening to music much more enjoyable compared to my other earbuds/headphones. Additionally, these earbuds are durable and well made compared to other earbuds of the same price.If you are going to spend fifty dollars, this is definitely the product to purchase."

6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I have had a lot of trouble finding the right set of earphones that deliver the audio quality with a mic and has Sound Isolation and that I can use with my iPhone, iPad and laptop. After several failed attempts at other products, I decided to go with this Shure model, what a great choice. They deliver the quality I want and they stay in my ears."

9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate to give these one star. They were AWESOME, and I would have given them 5 stars, but my return period ended two days ago and today one side went dead. NO SOUND WHATSOEVER. There's clearly a short in the wiring but I can either 1) live with only having one in-ear monitor or 2) buy them again (which I won't since they seem to break about 32 days in)."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was deeply disappointed by the sound quality of these headphones. As opposed to the ""sound isolation"" and ""great bass"" promised, the sound was tinny and top-heavy. I tried listening to both music and podcasts, and both sounded like I was playing them from dinky little computer speakers, except straight into my ears. Would rather listen to the crappy $10 earbuds I'd been using until these arrived, since I don't have to crank up the volume to dangerous levels just to hear what's going on on the low end.

I was very disappointed with the sound quality, the apple headphones that come with the iPhone are far superior to these even though they are not sound isolating. Sure really dropped the ball on these, price-wise they are affordable, and it does everything is says, but bottom line is the sound quality is very lacking, especially with the low-end.

7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If music is an important part of your life, like it is in mine, then a good pair of wireless headphones is essential. I've tried and owned numerous sets of headphones (both wired and wireless, around the ear and earbuds). I think the Shure sound-isolating earbuds are a solid middle-of-the-road option in the crowded field of headphones, and they're a good value for the money.

What I liked most about these earbuds:

1.) The sound isolation is superb. It's important to note that these headphones have ""passive"" noise isolation, not active noise cancellation. In other words, they are designed to shut extraneous noise out, not to actively counteract the sound waves coming in (which requires another higher level of technology). I have a set of the Bose Quiet Comfort (active) noise canceling headphones, and to be honest, I think the Shure earbuds do nearly a good job of blocking external noise as the much more expensive Bose set. In fact, when my husband was standing not four feet away from me and talking at a normal volume, I could not hear him at all. So that's extremely impressive, and as such I think these would make a great set of headphones for anybody needing to block out noisy roommates, coworkers, etc.

2.) The headphones are also extremely comfortable. I don't like most earbuds, actually, and find that they tend to make my ears sore after a half hour or so. But not the Shure earbuds. The earpieces themselves are almost round, like a ball, and made of a flexible rubber like substance. It's soft and comfortable in the ear.

3.) The Bluetooth technology is straightforward, and--unlike the case with other wireless speakers I've had in the past--I had no difficulty getting the earbuds to pair with any of my devices. I also like that when you turn them on, the earbuds will announce how much battery life you have left.

Features I wasn't so wild about:

1.) As with any set of earbuds, a proper fit is crucial to getting a good sound. In my case, the Shure earbuds had to be jammed pretty firmly into my ears to get the full depth and richness of the audio. Unfortunately, they dislodged easily and often. I tried using them during one of my gym workouts, and I was constantly having to reach up and readjust them. I don't recommend them for working out for that reason; instead, I'll use my Jaybird Freedom earbuds, which have a much better system for anchoring the earbuds in place.

2.) The cord was longer than other earbuds I've had, and the cord itself was a little thinner. This contributed to the buds not staying firmly in place, I think, as they wouldn't stay wrapped over my ears the way other sets would.

Last but definitely not least, how was the sound? I'd characterize it as good but not great. I'd rate the sound quality for music as about the same as I get on my (wired) iPhone earbuds. But the sound on the whole is a lot thinner, especially with respect to the bass, than I get with my NuForce HEM8 earbuds, which remain hands down the best sound I've ever had in a set of headphones. Of course, in all fairness to the Shure earbuds, the NuForce buds cost four times as much. But you get what you pay for, and if I could only have one set of earbuds, I'd go with the NuForce.

The bottom line? I think I'll start using these as my primary set for traveling. The sound isolation is terrific, and they're a LOT less bulky to cart around than my Bose Quiet Comfort set. But I'll use my Jaybirds for working out and the NuForce HEM8 for when I'm doing serious music listening."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I've ever had!
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of Shure headphones, and they are a different experience. The fit is a bit weird because the cord drapes over the back of your ear. They also sound below average if you don’t insert them a special way - upside down then rotate 180 degrees. Weird, right? It makes a difference. I put these through the paces with my standard song list below - one that I use for headphone reviews. The results were pretty good considering the cost. The bass is strong, but not overpowering. While not every voice of the low volume Chinese dialog at the beginning of “Chinese Democracy” came through, the SE-112 did a respectable job producing the majority of them. I have other in-ear headphones that I prefer, but I also paid a bit more for them. The performance across all genres of music is well above average. For newer models, you should expect to pay at least twice as much before you get a noticeable difference in performance.

In addition, the SE-112 are made with attention to the important details. The cable is strong, and it terminates in a right-angle plug - this should be a requirement for in-ear headphones. The material also has a semi-glossy coating that helps avoid tangles. The storage pouch is hard to close, but cases/pouches aren’t even a given in this price range. It’s hard to pick at the design other than the two oddities that I mentioned at the beginning. If you don’t want to break the bank, the Shure SE-112 is a good option.

0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,So frustrated right now with this piece of crap I am not going to continue. Logged in to find out if I can still return this overpriced junk. Then go get my wife's 11.00 wal mart special to finish.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones have excellent, clear sound with comfortable earbuds. On a scale of 1-10, the base is a 7 and the overall sound a 9.
They are easy to use and work well with a phone call. I happened to be trying them out the first time when I got a call. The volume can be controlled on the Android as well as the Shure cord. I had great sound from the ear phones and I was told that they were very clear on the other end of the call.
I found the Bluetooth pairing quick and easy to do. The directions are good. I found that I had to go to the bluetooth settings on my Android and tap ""more settings"" to have the Shure logo come up. I was done in seconds.
As far as the sound isolating function, I have always been a bit leery of this especially with ear phones. I must say that I cannot hear anything outside of the phones when they are firmly in my ears. Whether this is simply blocking the sound or isolating, I don't know. They do seem to be very much better than my other non-isolating phones.
I like the fact that it comes with a simple zippered case which has a pocket inside to hold the charging cord, extra earbuds and a cleaning tool. It also has a clip to secure it to a loop on clothing.
The phones stay on and in my ears securely and are not a bother. There is also a small clip which can attached to the cord and then clipped to your clothing. I'm very happy with how they feel and sound."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE - rewritten review. I initially didn't rate these very highly but on further experimentation I have to change up my review. I have a an older pair of Shure isolating earbuds - the kind where you roll the foam until compressed and then put them in your ears and let the foam expand. They are superb and are what I judge anything else by. I also own a pair of Sennheiser earbuds that are in the $30-ish range and really like them for everyday use.

These Shures fit where I would expect them - squarely in the middle. They are competent earbuds with adequate frequency response, though the bass is a little lacking. The Sennheisers that I have provide an abundance of bass and are ever so slightly boomy, not something you could say about these Shures. I would say the bass is adequate, but definitely not the lower end of the bass register. The Sennheisers reach a little deeper than these. The high-end Shures do have that very low bass, but they are more than 1.5 times the price of these.

These have over the ear wires, which helps support them - but you may or may not like that about these. The cords are thicker than you might be used to, but they contribute to holding them in place - they would be very good for active use. There is a slide on the cord that adjusts the amount of ""hold"" that the cords have on you. This all will make it much less likely to yank one out of your ear if you are a walker, runner, etc. like the plainer versions.

My overall view is that while the sound is slightly below what I would like, the overall package makes it a decent value at its price point.

I would also agree with other reviewers that it's important to get these situated in your ears correctly or they will be quite disappointing."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some of the better wireless headphones I’ve used. I am not a fan but looking at a new Iphone without a headphone jack is making me look for a pair I can use and still get decent sounding music. I own a corded pair of Shures and I love them. These wireless ones do not sound as good but they are far superior to any of the Jabra, Beats or Bose sets I tried. Sound is plenty loud, well balanced with nothing jumping out that sounds out of place. They are kind of boring from a sound perspective but that is OK in my book for wireless headphones.

Pairing was easy and ongoing connection has been mostly flawless with the exception of one time which required re-pairing. There have been no drop offs in sound or cracking or anything. Watching videos has been good as well with zero lag in audio. Everything stays synched nicely. Battery life has been pretty good as well and is close to stated time although I am getting about 30 minutes less. I assume that is because I tend to listen to music a bit louder. Charging is easy thanks to the standard USB cord. Nothing proprietary like others.

Range is easily well beyond 30 feet. I wear these most of the day in my office and have been 40 feet away and around corners with walls. These are really amazing on that front.

Overall, very happy with these and something I can wear daily. If I was going into a full blown music listening mode and wanted better separation or soundstage, I would most likely not use these. But for every day use, these are my new go to headphone."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've heard great things about Shure headphones, so I was really excited to try this pair out. But I have to say, I wasn't too blown away.

Pros:
- This does a solid job at isolating noise. It's not noise cancellation, but this actually does a really decent job for non-noise cancelling headphones.
- I found it pretty easy to find buds that fit comfortably in the ear.
- The battery life is okay (but not amazing).

Cons
- The sound is only decent. After everything I've heard about Shure headphones having awesome sound, I was kind of disappointed in these. They sound slightly tinny. The mid and high sounds are great and clear, but the bass is sorely lacking. Honestly, I have 30 dollar bluetooth Panasonic earbuds that sound a bit better than this.
- For some reason, I always have a bit of trouble connecting these to my iPhone. It's happened twice since I've had them, where I have to 'forget' the earbuds and then pair them again for it to work. These are the only bluetooth headphones that I have to do this with.

In the end, I was slightly disappointed by the Shure earbuds. While the noise isolation is superb, the sound is slightly lacking. I just don't think they're worth the price when you can get better sounding bluetooth headphones for cheaper (without the noise isolation, though). Oh, and the cord is extremely long."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless headphones are physically designed well and fit comfortably in my ears. I haven't had any issues with the cord getting in the way or the earbuds falling out of my ears. They fit in my ears pretty snug and I think that this helps contribute to the sound isolation. The battery life is pretty decent but doesn't seem to come even close to the 8 hours that Shure claims you're supposed to get. From my experience it seems closer to six hours max. My biggest issue of all is the quality of the sound. I don't know how other people feel, but if your looking for nice headphones then they should be able to get the most important thing right.....the sound. They seem to be very treble heavy and really lacking in the bass department; almost with a tinny sort of sound to them. At first I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they just needed to be broken in some more. But after more than 100 hours of use there is little improvement. So if you're looking for headphones that have a nice balance of bass and treble, or a lot bass, then you should probably look somewhere else. I expected the sound to be a lot better for headphones at this price point."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes great earphones and these are no different. Sure, you won't be getting the highest quality fidelity, but come on, it's bluetooth, what do you expect? That said, the bass is a little weak on these, so if you are looking for some heavy beats in your ear, these aren't the ones for you. But otherwise, they sound great, even if a little light on the low end. Battery life is great. I got close enough to the 8 hours claimed life to count (I say close enough because I didn't have a timer on it, just in my normal day to day use). I love that it can stay connected to two devices at once, so you don't have to go fiddling around pairing/unpairing/pairing. While the cord on these is really long and that bump in the middle, they stay in my ears pretty well, even when being somewhat active (though if I was going for a run, I'd definitely utilize the clip to attach it to my shirt). Last bit, while these aren't active noise canceling, in ear monitors can get a very good seal on your ear canal and definitely block out a lot of outside noise very well."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these wireless Shure earphones. In the morning when I go for my walkout with my dog, they are a staple with my attire and allow me to listen to my audio books without the hassle of wires connected to my iphone. Shure has been a staple to me since I was in my twenties (I actually used to be in a band and had Shure microphones), so I can testify to the quality of the Shure name (I like their sound quality better than my Bose headphones at about a third of the price). These are noise isolating and will work wonderfully for air travel as well.These would make a great Christmas gift for someone you love."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PRO:
1- Easy to pair with all of my bluetooth devices - one of the most important features for any bluetooth device, in my book.
2- Rubber tips in 3 sizes - you should have no trouble finding a comfortable fit.
3- Noise isolation is darn good!
4- Uses the exact same button functionality as iPhone earbuds (i.e., for microphone, volume and playback controls)
5- Battery life is excellent.
6- Includes a clip to secure the cord to your collar (which is needed to due to long cord- see below)
7- Comes with a zippered case, with a carabiner clip, 3 sizes of rubber tips and a charging cord

Other Comments:
8- Sound quality is acceptable, but I find the treble a bit too bright and the bass too weak for my tastes.
9- The cord is a too long. One of the reasons i like “wireless” earphones is to reduce the chance of catching the cord on something when i am mobile. I prefer a cord that just fits around my neck. This cord is approx 30 inches long.
10- Packaging difficult to open. Lots of paperwork enclosed - most of which had nothing to do with using the earphones."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two pairs of these over the last 5 years. They did not experience hard, or even daily, use. Both pairs failed after about 18 months. The sound in one side started to be intermittent, and then stopped altogether. I gave these a second try after the first premature failure, hoping I'd gotten a lemon, but twice in a row tells me that they're just not a good product. Which is sad, because the sound on even this low end model is really good.

I have other earbuds that are 10 years old and still function perfectly after more use. For the price, I expect good durability in addition to quality sound, and these don't provide it."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these to my oldest daughter for review, and this is what she wrote:
So far I like the headphones. Good quality of sound, feels like the sound is in middle instead of on both sides. Not sure about the range of how far I can be from my phone. Left it upstairs at my grandparents and walked all over the house and it never went out of range. Only issues I have is that they are front heavy so the charging station pulls on the earpiece a little. I connected the clip to it and that made it a little better, but you have to make sure to look straight forward when clipping in or the clip can cause tension on shirt and still pull earpiece out. The other issue is the earpiece itself. I’m using the smallest one and it’s still a little large for my ears, I feel like I really have to shove it in my ear so they’ll stay."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These in-ear phones are sturdy and they do a good job of blocking out environmental noise. You can insert them so that the cord loops back behind the ear, or so that it just hangs down from the ear. If you achieve a good seal (you need to choose the right size sleeve, and get the bud well into the ear canal), you will be rewarded with decent bass response, and the `phones will indeed attenuate extraneous sounds, like street noises or an airplane engine.

That said, this model does not provide the most sparkling high frequencies or the deepest bass that you can get from a pair of in-ear devices. To get better sound, you need to move up to the Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor, Black, a $99 item designed and marketed as an in-ear performance monitor for professional musicians.

I evaluated these phones by comparing their performance with two other models: the Klipsch Image S4i-II Black In-Ear Headphones in-ear phones that I often use for travel, and the PSB M4U 2 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones featuring Room Feel headphones that I got for Christmas 2013. The Klipsch phones are similar in price and performance to the Shure SE215-K, but they do not block out environmental noise very well. The PSBs are actual on-ear noise-cancelling headphones, with settings that provide a choice between ""passive"" performance (no noise-cancelling), battery-assisted performance (useful with low-powered sources like the iPod), and noise cancelling (active engagement of a microphone that captures environmental noise and generates a signal that counteracts the noise). So they don't provide a fair comparison with the SE112-GR's -- instead, they constitute a benchmark for excellent noise reduction and high fidelity.

While I would not use the SE112-GR for situations in which the strongest possible musical response was desirable, I would definitely use them for exercise or for a backup pair on a plane trip (I often use the PSBs on the plane, in spite of their size, because they do so well with noise cancellation). The SE112-GR is made with a rubberized surround on the part of the buds that you grip to insert and extract them from your ears -- so that is really useful when your hands or ears get wet from perspiration. Also, it probably strengthens the integrity of the bud and protects the equipment if you drop it, etc.

ADDENDUM, July 14 2014: Yesterday I had the opportunity to compare these earphones with $29 Apple EarPods, an entry-level product that first shipped with the iPhone 5 in 2012. In a brief test with a variety of musical material, the EarPods bested the Shure SE112 in every category except sound isolation. They are an easier load for headphone amps and computers, portable devices, etc. to drive, so they sound louder -- but even after adjusting the sound level, I found the EarPods produced a bigger sound, with richer harmonic detail, a wider frequency spectrum, and better imaging. This surprised me, and I feel compelled to lower my rating of the SE112 by one star. This makes it even more obvious that if you want good sound from a sound-isolating in-ear phone, you're going to need to get into the $100 to $200 price range. A number of excellent candidates are available there, including market leaders from Etymotic Research, HiFiMan, and RHA.

The one drawback that I've found to using all ""sound isolating"" earphones on a plane trip is that if you place them in your ears, creating a good seal, while the plane is ascending or descending, you'll experience discomfort in your ears as the cabin pressure changes, because the earphone seal prevents your ears from popping so as to adjust to the changes. You pretty much have to wait until you're at cruising altitude. Regardless of price or quality, that's a constant."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like Most: They do isolate sound. I even turned down the volume and barely could hear my son (he had to yell). Easy to set up and use. I love the little bag and the extra items. The music did sound great too.
Like Least: It would not turn on if it states less than 6 hours of charge. It will turn on with more than 6 hours. I had to charge it twice before I could use them. They are a bit long but you are supposed to wrap them around your ears. Do not have control over what you are listening too. The ear pieces were pretty big."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good afternoon.
my sister bought this headphone for me and since he comes already with a defect, but as I do not live in the US, was hard to complain.
I'm going in June to Miami. Is there anywhere that I can change or fix the headphones?
Thank you."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure Wireless Sound Isolating Bluetooth headphones are great quality at a good value. The earbuds fit good in the hear and the wire goes over the ear and helps keep the buds in. The sound is easier on the bass compared to other Bluetooth earbuds I own. Features on these buds that don't exist on my other Bluetooth earbuds include a microphone; 8 hours of runtime without charging, and a clip that helps the wire from flopping around. The sound quality is pretty good. Lots of value for the price."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A minute or two on Amazon and you'll be able to find hundreds of earbuds. A trend in recent years has been to label them with a famous name--a producer, a hip-hop personality--and to tart them up with a designer look. Shure is the antithesis of that. They make simple gear that sounds good. Decades and decades in the transducer business give them the right to ignore all of that other stuff.

I placed these buds into a shootout with the only other earbuds that matter--my trusty Shures. My SE115s have been in use for a few years and they cost twice the price of the SE112s. It's not surprising they won the shootout. But the differences were subtle--a little more transparency, the edge of the violin bow, articulation on a tenor sax buried deep in a mix. The SE112s held up nicely. They're unforced, with a clear low end (not the thumping bass in the car next to you at the stoplight). You can listen to them for quite some time without fatigue.

The SE112s come with inserts of three different sizes. For my particular ears, this wasn't enough. The size that fit my ear canal best proved uncomfortable (coming quite close to the eardrum). The next size up doesn't seat securely. I compared these to the inserts from my older Shures and could see some differences in shape. It's quite true that ear canals are pretty personal, and these buds should fit most ears comfortably. But they don't fit mine. After a little rummaging around (this is why I never throw things away) I found inserts from another set of buds that fit more comfortably.

As you'd expect with Shure, construction is solid. If you take reasonable care of them, they'll hold up for years. Don't bother with junk. These are so much better."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good...the range of sound it provides is good enough to separate the instruments. the lows as with many in-ear monitors is OK. It is not over exaggerated and does not bleed into the mid sounds or high sounds. I think the major issue with them is that most people have a bit of trouble putting them on at first. The earbuds are bit hard at first but with use they become comfortable. Also on your first week of use they will fall off your ear from time to time, but you will become used to them and you will manage to set them in your ear correctly and they won't fall off. Over-all I think they sound good for $45. I will say they are 100% better than the EEM 6 PRO in sound."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE these packs. They are the perfect size, made from safe material, dishwasher safe, perfect for putting homemade applesauce, yogurt, smoothies in. Less mess, kids have fun. They're perfect!"
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for the Kindle Fire Tablets and Laptop from which I play music. All in all, it holds on my ear ok, haven't had too much of problem slipping out. But, placing the hook over the year can be troublesome. But, for the music, doesn't sound great. I would expect that my music sound great.... for the price. It sounds tinny, just not something I want to have for listening to my music, youtube, etc."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are a far cut above what you normally get with most ipod and other devices. Build quality, extras, materials and a heavy duty cord set them apart. They compete well in their price range. I also own Shure's higher end earphones.

Packaging and extras are excellent. You receive extra rubber ear inserts in various sizes to get a tight fit which is essential in these type earphones. You also get a pouch and wax removal tool.

Build quality is excellent and up to Shure's standards as in their highly regarded and more expensive models. The cord is heavy duty and tangle resistant. The ear pieces are substantial. Many earphones fail in the cord connections and I just don't see that happening with these unless they are abused or accidently over-stressed. Connections are tight and substantial.

Sound is well balanced, full, and not overly accentuated in any particular frequency. I found it takes about 20 hours of use to break these in. Sound then, is somewhat warm, which means the mids and highs are not overly accentuated but well balanced. Bass is full but not overblown. If you like earphones which emphasize bass over other frequencies, look elsewhere. The sound is typical of Shure's excellent high end earphones, which is to say excellent for a single driver earphone.

Where I have troubles is in the fit. I prefer foam inserts and just can't find a good Shure rubber insert that doesn't cause me some pain and discomfort after about an hour of use. I use my Shure foam inserts in highend models for hours on end. Eerphones of this type require a good tight fit in the ear. I get that tight fit here but with some discomfort. I don't find this true of other earphones with rubber inserts I've used such as Sennheiser and Etymotic. Maybe it is just the way these fit.

If you don't have discomfort issues with the rubber inserts I highly recommend these earphones and would give them four stars. You simply won't find better sound and quality for the price."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested these Shures using uncompressed sound tracks on my Macbook Pro, through a Sony PHA-2 headphone amp as a reference. For comparison I used Shure E5C earbuds and the results were predictable but on reflection very favorable. On the plus side, I appreciated the fit. The plugs come with several sizes of inserts for you to swap out depending on your individual needs. The mid size was affixed on unboxing but I found the small inserts to be a perfect fit. They're very comfortable and light and without that compression feeling some earbuds produce. The cord is slightly thicker than many products and seems to resist tangling. The earbuds are plastic, but have a nice fit and finish and don't look at all cheap. My impression is that the construction is relatively solid and should last a long time. The main concern for anyone is, of course, the sound. At first listen I felt a little disappointed. I listened to some Jonny Lang Blues, Some ZZ Top, and some Yo Yo Ma Cello. The much higher priced Shures were predictably bright, crisp, and lifelike and with booming base as well. These SE112's were flat and muted by comparison. Listening a little longer, I realized that that was not necessarily a bad thing. The sound was enjoyable especially with a relatively good base reproduction and sound in the vocals range, with a forced but enjoyable warmth. Highs seemed a little clipped, muted and flat. These are obviously not high end, but the user will be wearing them casually on the bus or in some public noisy place. In that environment, the sound and reproduction are actually ideal. They come with a small felt pouch with a draw string and clasp for storage. In terms of construction, a very comfortable fit, good sound isolation, relatively good base and warm strings and vocals, at this $50 price point I found them quite good. I'll also feel more comfortable carrying and using these in casual situations without the anxiety of theft or loss of earbuds costing over 10 times as much. I'm obviously not some audio authority, just a typical consumer, but if you're looking for an improvement over what comes with most cell phones and MP3 players without spending a fortune, you might find these a good fit.

UPDATE: I've been using these earbuds a few weeks now for music, but especially for watching movies on my Note 3 via Netflix, as well as Coursera lectures and have to say I'm liking them more and more. Fitted correctly in the ear canals, the sound isolation is excellent and the sound quality is really excellent. The wire insulating material and it's slightly thicker diameter do a great job at reducing tangles, so I've never needed to unravel an intertwined mess. I remove them from the pouch and they just sort of separate and you're good to go. Extremely happy with them."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve owned a lot of shure headphones and these are typical great quality you expect from their phones and in ear monitors. Accurate and abundant sound that’s distortion free without the typically over emphacized bass. Likewise the sound isolation with their foam tips is nearly as good as most ear plugs. The these would be solid 9 out of 10’s.... except the battery life on my pair is averaging 4 hours. Only 50% of advertised 8 hours. First use I’d guess I got close to 8 but no longer. Maybe it’s an iPhone issue but if the problem sorts itself out I will update.
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overview: these phones represent a huge upgrade over any stock earphones. But, they are a distinct level below Shure's previous offerings. A good option for the price conscious, though serious audiophiles will want to look elsewhere.

This is my fourth pair of Shure headphones. With the exception of the Shure SCL4 Sound Isolating Earphone with High-Definition MicroSpeakers with Tuned BassPort, Black, which were stolen, I still own and use the others: Shure SE310 Sound Isolating Earphone - White and Shure E2 Sound Isolating Earphones.

Shure has always operated on the Ray Ban theory when it comes to pricing; very high list prices but periodic sales. I've always felt like the quality has been there with Shure headphones, but I never paid full price for them.

Now Shure has gone in a different direction with these phones, which are modestly priced and modestly equipped. Gone is the two staged cord, which could be separated depending on whether your listening device was in your shirt pocket. Also gone is the hard case to carry your headphones and the extensive set of ear pieces--though you get a few.

Curiously, unlike Shure's typical straight plug design, the cord of these phones has a 90 degree bend at the tip. This was probably done to make them sturdier, but will have the effect of complicating insertion into phones with deeply recessed cases. (I later noticed that my lower end E2s also have this 90 degree bend, whereas the SE310s do not.)

With that excessive preamble out of the way, let's evaluate the phones on what I think are the four most relevant factors in making your decision: sound, fit and comfort, sound isolation, and price.

Sound

Relative to the Shure E2 headphones, the listening experience is boomier and lacks a bit of clarity. A knock on Shure phones has always been that they deliver on the high and mid range, but they leave the rhythm section in the cold. To paraphrase, where's the bass? These phones have been engineered to counteract that criticism--they have solid, boomy bass. But, left on the cutting room floor is the superb clarity of previous Shure offerings in the high and mid.

Sound Isolation

Pretty good, but not the ""hear yourself thinking"" silence you get from Shure's higher end offerings. This isn't all bad, as they make for good city walkers where you want to hear a bit of ambient sound so you have a fighting chance of avoiding being run over by a deranged cabby.

Fit and Comfort

Although you don't get as many options as previous Shure products, unless you have seriously difficult ears you will find a decent fit. I was able to find a good fit pretty quickly. As far as comfort, these phones are perhaps the most comfortable in-earphones I've ever worn.

Price

These phones are very fairly priced in the market. Quality wise, they are superior to TDK's offering and equivalent to the comparably priced Sennheisers.

Overall, these are very decent, though not great headphones that are a good fit for someone looking for a modest upgrade over stock phones at a modest price."

NOISE ISOLATING NOT NOISE CANCELLING IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
Per the info: “Sound Isolating design featuring comfortable sound isolating sleeves blocks up to 37 dB of ambient noise for extended listening, without distractions”. This means the sound isolation is mechanical, the way the headset fits in your ear. That is how the headset isolates the external sound. It is not electrical Noise Cancellation. I opted to get these thinking they were noise cancelling. I had a pair of Centrios noise cancelling ear phones that I traveled with. It was wonderful when I could not hear the jet noise. I would wear those even without music on.
That is NOT what this headset does. My mistake.

PAIRING AND INITIAL USAGE
Pairing is accomplished by holding down the center button of the controller for about 8 seconds. It was easy to do and I paired these headphones with both my phone and when I got into work my Mac Pro.

Using the headphones with music at home, I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary regarding the noise isolation. They had a good sound and it was nice not to have a cable running to my phone. I had considered wearing these to listen to my Calm app with Sleep stories (to help me fall asleep), but don’t think I can lay on my side with the way these earplugs stick out. Thought the noise isolation would help with my boyfriend's snoring.

Using the headphones at work there is a constant hum in my office that these headphones did not address, but it made conversations more muted."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great and work well when sitting. They seem durable and well-built and the microphone / control works well. However, the cabling is very stiff and ungainly, often pushing on the buds in my ear or getting tangled up.

Personally, I need to use in-ear (in lieu of the Apple buds which fall out) and these don't seem to stay fit in-ear for long. After just a few minutes of walking, they work their way out. I'm testing different sizes of the cups, to see if that might help. I used to use Sony buds and they didn't have the cable issue, but didn't sound as well or last more than a few months at a time.

These come with a small carrying bag, which is nice to keep them clean."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My reviewing perspective
*I'm using the Shure SE112 Earphones with a 4th generation iPod Touch and an iPad Mini that are loaded with music in MP3 and AAC formats.
*On my iDevices I mostly listen to rock and jazz. I don't like to hear a lot of bottom end, especially over headphones and earbuds.
*I'm not an especially demanding mobile listener because when I want to hear great sound or listen to classical music, I rely on my home stereo (yes, that's incredibly old school, I know).

What I like
*These earphones generate good sound. The high end, midrange, and low end are well balanced and clear, to my ears.
*The ear tips help ensure a good seal for blocking outside noise. Three sets of tips are included: large, medium, and small.
*The combination of a light weight and the soft tips make the SE112s very comfortable to wear for long periods.
*The Left and Right markings on the buds are large and easy to read.
*A velvet carrying pouch and cleaning tool are provided.

There is something important to keep in mind, though. As with anything that tightly seals up the ear canal, any movement in the earphones or cord translates into a distracting noise. Loud, busy songs can mask the movement sounds but they can be heard over most music.

Bottom line: The Shure SE112 Earphones are a fine way to listen to music. The big caveat, in my opinion, is that the movement noise makes these earphones unsuitable for workout or any other use that makes the cord swing around. If you can keep the cord still, though, the SE112s are a good replacement for cheap, stock earbuds. Four stars.

Update (October 2017): now also using with an iPhone 6s for listening to music (remember, these 'phones don't have a mic). No problems to report."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a pair in 2010. They sound great, when inserted properly, although it took me a while to get used to wearing them over the ear.

I didn't use them everyday but ultimately they suffered from the same problems as my previous pair of Shure in-ear headphones:

1) the cord starts splitting near any joints, exposing the wires. I was able to prolong the life by another year with Sugru patches.

2) the cord breaks internally near the angled plug, resulting in complete sound loss in one ear unless the cord is held at a certain angle, and even then, it's only a temporary solution.

If I buy Shure in-ear headphones again, it'll only be as a last resort."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these to keep as back-ups for a more expensive pair of in-ear monitors I use playing live. I then began using them almost daily, and can say these things are pretty much indestructible.

Mine have been dropped, thrown, kicked, stepped on in a gravel parking lot, left in cars both boiling hot and freezing cold, run through the washing machine and savagely attacked by a teething poodle, and they haven't missed a beat.

Sound wise, they cover the spectrum about as well as any single-driver ear bud can. They isolate outside noises well enough, and you can use a variety of tips to find a comfortable fit.

Overall, very good for the price."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones are good all around earphones, but nothing about them stand out as special. They are comfortable, and include a variety of different size ""sleeves"" for different sized ears. They do a good job of isolating ambient sound. The 50"" wire is a good length in my opinion. Sound quality is good all-around. I have earphones that sound better, but I also have some that are not as good. At this fairly low price point, the sound quality is more than acceptable. I listened to all different types of music to test these out, and the results were all for the most part positive. Shure advertises these to have ""Deep Bass"". I feel that is a little bit of a stretch. The bass isn't bad, but it was a little lacking for my tastes. The highs and mid-tones were all there though. All in all, they're just ""good"" all around. I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. In order to get the best sound and isolation, you have to make sure you have them inserted into your ears properly, using the correct size sleeve. If you're looking for earphones that won't break your bank, then I recommend the Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones are comfortable to wear, lightweight, and sound great. The earphones are supplied with 3 different sizes of sleeves; fortunately one of the sizes was a good fit, and provided the most external sound isolation. I tested the earphones with a ""pure"" 40 hz wave, this being fairly close to the stated limit of the frequency response. I did not sense any over-driving or distortion. In real-world use, a recording of a symphony orchestra sounded full in the bass and without attenuation at the upper frequencies. It may be that people accustomed to hearing exaggerated bass and treble might find the set slightly muted. However, the phones felt like they had plenty of reserve in terms of being able to handle louder volumes, i.e. in normal use I did not feel as if I was driving them to anywhere near their limit."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is very good and it tells you how much time you have on the battery. It took a little fiddling but once we got the right earbud on they were quite comfortable
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes solid audio equipment and I was excited to try these headphones out for running. They do sound great, but their comfort and fit is maddening.

The piece where the wire splits off into their respective earbud is made of slightly heavy plastic. That's a great design for strengthening an otherwise weak area, but it adds just enough weight that running (or even walking) gets it to bounce just enough and pull your headphones out. I tried putting it inside my shirt and the wires and/or separator would get caught with the same result. These need a clip and luckily I had a spare.

Once clipped, the earbuds never got tugged out by the weight of the cord but do work themselves out when running. I found myself readjusting them about every 30 seconds to 1 minute on my runs. It will slowly drive you insane, I promise.

In all, there are some better options out there. It's worth spending a little more and getting a much, much better set of earbuds both in quality and sound."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first thought when I got these earphones and I put them in without reading the instructions was....these are not very good....

But fortunately, I spent 60 seconds scanning the instructions and as it turns out, you have to insert these upside down (so the cord comes out on top). Magically as I rotated them in my ears 180 degrees, the sound came alive. There was a bit of presence to the music and finally some bass.

With that out of the way, my go-to ear buds for running are the Bose IE2 phones. However, these are almost half the price, and they're very similar sonically. Better, the cord is sturdy, and thicker, so it will not tangle, and I'd judge the build quality better overall.

What about the sound? It's full, the bass is there, and it's enjoyable to listen to music. They have sufficient volume from an iPod or other portable electronics, and feel very comfortable using them pretty much anywhere.

These are an excellent value and will be my new go-to earphones.

Good sound if inserted correctly

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these headphones. Compared with similarly priced SOL phones, these are tinny sounding at best. They have very little base and even the mid and high ranges were muffled and muddled. My music sounded like it was passing through a very thick panel of gauze. The Shure SE 112 is quite comfortable and fitted in my ears quite well, hence the two stars."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older model to the present Shure SE112 for 8 years now. It took some good beating but still works great. I've used them while sleeping to cancel out snoring when camping. I've stepped on them. I sport with them. At some point they even got little cracks around the housing of the monitors, but sound is still sweet as ever. I'm upgrading to the Shure 215's. No regrets! Worth every cent!"
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones in December of 2011 and they have been working ever since. The sound quality is actually over my expectations for the price. The mids and highs are where these shine. They are loud and clear and even block out some of the noise. The bass is average I would say. Not too much but not too little where you can't hear it. The thing I love most about these earphones is the fact that I have put them through a lot of abuse and they still work perfectly. I work in a shop every summer and they have seen sparks, filler dust, and even a little heat from cutting torches and welding. Overall I'd say these earphones are a very good buy for the price. There are better options out there but as long as these have lasted they have fully surpassed my expectations."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned 3 sets of Shure's extremely expensive models in the $600.00 +++ range. So I understand just how the very expensive models sound. What happens over the years is some of the previous high end technology reaches to the affordable introductory models - just like this model. Shure has included several sizes of ear foams for a comfortable set. The sound is very pleasant and gives a very pleasing range with a pleasing bass. I remember many years ago someone giving me their Walkman and telling me how great it sounded. I was polite and not impressed but we have come a long way and these are very good sounding and good value for someone looking for a reasonably priced upgrade.

If you can though, spend $30-$40 more and get the Shure 215's. Your ears will thank you and if your cord ever breaks you can easily replace it without throwing out the earbuds... not something you can do with these SE112's.

As for taking calls with the mic, its OK, not great. Fine for the occasional call, but you wouldn't want to run a conference call on them. It picks up a lot of background noise and movement."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has good solid bass (not the overwhelming false bass that some cheap headphones do) and I especially like that high frequencies are well presented. comfortable for me. I also own some much more expensive headsets (which I don't want to take with me out of the house) and while they are better, the Shure SE112 really gives them a run for the money."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these due to Shure's claims on their website that their headphones should work well in ""hostile"" environments such as sweat. Despite the claims, my headphones were horrible when used while exercising. Tried to run with them, but within 20 minutes of a summer run, sweat would cause the headphones to stop working completely. Shure's website claims, ""All of our earphones are tested in the presence of heat, humidity, and salt spray to make sure that they work in such a hostile environment. They are typically worn for hours at a time, and as you can imagine, the earphones are exposed to a lot of sweat."" I called Shure to complain and was told it wasn't unexpected that they wouldn't work well in sweaty conditions. When I pointed out that this was contradicted by their advertising, they were very nonplussed, and said they could try and repair them but that it was probably just going to happen again."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the ear buds went out and I've probably only worn them 10 times
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones seem to fit well in the ear and are better built then most of the competition in there price range. They seem to isolate extraneous outside noise and deliver a decent tonal range although in my opinion not as good as my older Senheiser phones which are superior in the higher tonal range. That said I must mention that the input pin on my older earphones has already failed because of its weaker construction. I also own older Koss Sportapro stereo phones that have passed the test of time and abuse and are still operative due to their sturdy construction. In summary these headphones deliver very good sound, are well built, and should last a long time. Hopefully their competitors will start designing better earphones and headsets using thicker wiring and sturdier connectors for longer lasting products."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Marvelous! I love Shure headphones. I've used them for years because they allow for better fit and comfort in my ear. Now with wireless option it has helped with freedom of movement.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not saying I am an audiophile, but I have tried many of the best earphones of previous years. As with many of these products the Shure SE112 has delivered the crispest of sounds and has performed remarkably. It allows you to listen to every single detail in a song even from a low volume (3/15 on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2). As an added plus these headphones also add noise concealing so one can listen to music without any bother from the outside world.
The only drawback is the use of these earphones during a run. They are not perfect fit and tend to fall out. But they were made for enjoying music not exercise which is why I gave them a 5/5. Would definitely buy them again."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these specifically to use with my phone on calls. The sound is good if nothing to write home about. They feel well maid and are comfortable during calls (Which is way more than I could say about the Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone).
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. I use them on my frequent long bus rides and whenever I have 30 min to spare. I wanted great sound and something that would stand up the wear they endure during frequent use, these do that perfectly. The sound is balanced and a good value for the price. The cords are thick and seem well built. The sound isolation is great. I have used these on airplanes and noisy busses and all you hear is your music. Overall great earphones."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have other sets of (more expensive) earphones, but have found that these often are better for outdoor use while walking or riding bus or trolley. Admittedly, I am a senior citizen whose hearing isn't what it used to be, but the sound is very good. Good spread of stereo separation, good balance of full range of sound for listening to classical music, along with a range of sizes of ear tips designed to fit and stay securely in the ear."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am getting a bit puzzled... I own a lot of headphones, ranging from very cheap to my best: AKG K702 65th anniversary edition.
So the price ranges from about $5 to about $400...
Here comes the Shure SE112-GR for a starting price of $70... and it sounds very good!... I own already two other pairs of Shure: the SE-215 and the SE-530 and this one sounds somehow as good....

What I like:
- Maybe only 1 driver but it drives very well. The sound is full and not lacking at any frequency.
- Bass is present but not overwhelming.
- Sells for about $50 now.
- Shure is a very good brand.
- Fairly good separation or instruments.
- Solid non tangle cable (angled connector for better solidity).
- Tiny pouch for carrying case

What I like less:
- No remote
- No mic
- Cable goes around the ears... It may be good for working out but not as well for casual use (Need two hands to place).

Conclusion:

If you need a simple, no frills headset for casual use and workouts, this set may be the right one for you. You will get good sound, good bass.
If you need for a headset that can be multi-usages, you could try the Denon AH-C50 MA that sells for the same price but has less bass."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Materials and build are decent at the price point.

Having fit them properly, I was deeply, deeply disappointed in the sound quality. Bass was very absent, mids were clear but lacking dynamics, and the treble was tinny and quite jarring. I ended up returning them and getting refurbished Klipsch R6 earbuds for $20 less, which sound great at this price point.

I would not recommend the Shure se112 if they were less than $10. They sound terrible."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all these headphones sound bad, all high end, no low end. Secondly, they stopped connecting to my girlfriend's phone and consecutively my phone just after I was not able to return them... how convenient. DO NOT BUY THESE, THEY ARE GARBAGE, LITERALLY."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound of the earphones, the bass and treble sound great.

It has the elastic ear buds but I have some issues fitting into my ears for too long as they tend to fall off somehow, therefore I do not get the isolating effect from these earphones.

A relatively high quality pair of earphones good for travels in small places such as plane travels or cruises. Otherwise I prefer my headphones anytime."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Shure earbuds I recently used (the other being the SE315 model). In both cases I've gone thru the terrible experience in that one earbuds essrntially gives our (by losing volume) after little use. In the case of the SE112 it started out new so that's why it's especially disappointing. (For the other pair I had to at least give a benefit of doubt because I got it not in new condition though it was stated to be of minimal use, but I paid much more for it). I was hoping Shure would be a higher-end product I can use for home listening versus what I use when outdoors (currently a pair of JLab J5 which has lasted a long time). Unfortunately it turns out to not be the case. I won't be buying any more Shure products, that's for sure (some pun intended)."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received these ear buds as a gift three years ago. I'm rough on headphones and these are still going strong.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely sound quality and plenty of bass, but not overpowering. The sound canceling is great for a 50$ dollar pair of headphones. The pair comes with 3 different bud sizes, and when you get a good fit the sound comes alive. Listening to any music with them compared to the default iPhone ear-buds is a night and day difference. By far the best quality and value for ear-buds I have ever seen. Great highs and even better lows."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am disappointed with these earphones. They are a great price and comfortable to wear, but the sound quality is awful. They are very tinny and have almost no bass. I purchased these because of the reputation Shure has for great audio products, but they fall short on the earphones in that respect. They are okay for talking, but awful for music. They earn the two stars for price and comfort. I will be sticking with better quality and more expensive earphones in the future and pass on the Shure brand."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used Shure E2Cs for years, and have been quite happy with them. I was looking forward to trying a newer model of Shure's thinking things might have gotten even better. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. These earbuds have no bass whatsoever. The sound is very thin, and just not good at all. I tried multiple tips, and positioned them with the cable up, and the cable down, with no change in sound quality. Even at this price point, I cannot recommend these earphones."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound (expected at the price-point), but they don't fit well at all. I have medium-sized ears (I am 6'3""), but these earbuds barely fit even when using the smallest inserts.

The inserts are also very hard and hurt my ears after extended use. I will be buying other headphones for extended use..."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent earphone. Brilliant sound and deep bass. The best for cost/benefit.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very diverse collection of speakers and headphones and earphones, and I rate these only slightly above the cheap Sonys that came with my iPod Classic. I have had a few earphones even cheaper than these that have a better sound, especially those made by Klipsch, while Yamaha makes vastly better earphones for just a little bit more money. I say this as someone who has owned Shure earphones before, and really loved what I had. My problem with these earphones are twofold.

First, they will not last. Over time I've realized that rubber coated wires are going to die sooner than you would wish. Especially if you live in a place like Chicago, where I lived for thirty years. One Chicago winter and these earphones would be dead.

Second, the sound is dense and muddy. A lot of earphones advertising a strong bass are trying to make you confuse a booming, muddy sounds with ""strong bass."" What you really should be looking for is a clear, strong tremble. Any set of earphones can produce something a ""strong bass,"" but I've found that the real challenge is finding earphones with anything even remotely approximating clarity and articulation. Instead of getting these rotten earphones for $50, go up to $95 and get yourself some lovely Yamaha EPH-100SL's. Your ears will thank you, as will the music you listen to one them.

Than said, in the past I've had some wonderful Shure earphones. These simply aren't them."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"hesitant at first, but they won me over."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones, decent price. Unique quality of the Shure sound I've become used to: Heavy in bass, yet clear. I would knock the price down about 20% to make a value."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice price
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned 10 different earbuds over the years. These are absolutely the best I have ever had.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty disappointed with these, they are built well and feel solid, and come with a nice cleaning tool and case but thats about it. Sound wise they are no better than the standard iPhone earbuds. The bass is terrible, everything sounds so ""thin"" and I have no idea why they thought it would be a good idea to make you put the cord behind your ear, you have to or they sound even worse, its really uncomfortable and just looks weird. Probably gonna return these and just get another pair of normal iPhone earbuds sadly."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Would not work with Android devices. This is as much a criticism of the manufacturer as it is Amazon. If a product is not compatible with a major model of technology on the market (e.g. Android OS devices), then it would be best to make that as clear as possible to the consumer."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, but...this is my fourth purchased pair of Shure earphones. None have failed, I broke one, and the others are still used in different places. Point is I used to like them. They employ an unusual wires-over-the-ear-wrap as they have before, but this version has wires so stiff they don't seem to 'want' to fit the plan of wrapping and more importantly staying there. I keep hoping the wires will break in but so far no luck. In addition, they used to come with a quality protective zippered case. Now just a cheap drawstring bag. Fortunately I kept the case from the set that I stepped on. As I mentioned, sound quality is good but otherwise a hassle thus far. Not impressed with this current cost-cutting version. Disappointed, in fact."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did enjoy these earphones a lot, as the normal size buds were just the right size to tightly fit, and block most outside sources of noise. As it channels the sound towards your ear channel, when you start playing music, even at relatively low volumes, you get separated from the outer world nicely!
Even for those having issues with the buds, there`s the foam option, which I purchased for my wife, and those are not only even more effective, but are also more comfortable for those with smaller size ears.
There may be better ones, but these are definitely a great value. I`ve tried several earphones before, even with noise cancellation features, but this is way better than any of the others I tried."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great but are immensely uncomfortable and a pain to keep in your ears. The cable is supposed to go up and over the back of your ears, but keeping them there is near impossible if you move your head at all. Also, I'm using the smallest insert and I still get a headache fairly quickly. I never had any of these issues with my old sennheisers which were comparatively hassle free."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent build quality, but zero bass. For ordinary use listening to music on a phone or mp3 player, these are actually tragic to hear."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my everyday headphones, and I use them with my laptop, my phone, etc atleast a few times a day. Never had any problems.

They are extremely comfortable and can be worn for hours. Also the build quality is worth mentioning. I use them so frequently but have had no issues with them ever. The build is solid."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Shure Sound Isolating Earphones. They are really good at isolating outside noise and stuff. However, the rubber on the earphones easily peels off so they are a little uncomfortable to wear. I have 2 sets of these earphones and both did the same thing. I cannot recommend these due to the cheapness of the rubber."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used a ton of earbuds usually in the price range of $50-150 and these are decent with a few problems. My friends probably think I'm getting commission from Comply but I can't say enough, Comply earbud tips solve every ear seal problem, they are amazing and you can get solid bass from $3 earbuds with Comply tips. Always ignore any review of any earbud that says ""horrible bass"" because what they mean is ""horrible tips don't fit in my ears right."" As for these earbuds, the sound quality is pretty good. Great detail, bass isn't enhanced so it doesn't drown out the rest of the sounds but I bet with the stock tips it sounds like crap. Keep in mind that if you have an Android phone you won't be able to use the volume controls but I bought these mostly for my macbook at work. These things would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that they are designed to have the wire go ""over your ear"" but the wire is so thick that it falls off your ear if you are sitting as it doesn't want to bend. They should have heat-formed the wire to have a natural bend. I will probably do this on my own with a hair dryer. It is bad enough to lose it two stars as I've had to put the wire back over my ears twice while writing this review and I have fairly large dumbo ears that shouldn't have this problem."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at church to plug into a monitor system on stage while playing keyboard. They fit securely in your ear, provide superior sound, and truly cuts down on most of the background noise most earphones like this allow through. I usually only play with one plug in one ear, and leave the other one out, so I can hear the live sound as well."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones because I lost my beloved Sony earbuds. My previous buds had excellent sound quality and great isolation and Sony has usually been my go-to for earbuds. I thought After much research I thought I'd give the Shure's a shot and I'm not disappointed!

I tested every feature straight out of the box : Sound Quality and Clarity, Isolation and Comfort, Microphone and Remote functionality.

In terms of overall sound they were initially lacking. The highs and mids were not very crisp and the bass didn't quite ""punch."" They sounded like lower grade headphones. After about 45 listening I let these puppies burn in. I let them play all my music for about 3 hours around 40dB and it made a huge difference. The bass was really coming through and the sound was less thin. I re-listened with my usual playlist :
Main Theme - LA Noire Soundtrack (Andrew Hale)
Movie Theme - The Information (Beck)
All In - Until The Quiet Comes (Flying Lotus)
The Nightcaller - Until The Quiet Comes (Flying Lotus)
Fratres for Eight Cellos - Fratres (Arvo Part)
Digital Lion - Overgrown (James Blake)
Une barque sur l'ocean - Ravel Complete Works for Solo Piano (Jean-Yves Thibaudet)
When Did You Stop Loving Me - Marvin Gaye

In terms of isolation these are a great option for the price. They do lack drivers and rely on the tips and design to block out the noise but they succeed nonetheless. For safety it's probably best to wear these in more quiet areas and when you aren't trying to have a conversation with someone. After long periods of time they can become uncomfortable. They must remain quite tight in the ears to get the best out of the isolation and sound clarity. They can also be in different ways and not only with the cord over the top of the ear.

The microphone works well and the remote is responsive. I made a few phone calls and the people I spoke with had no trouble hearing me and said it was very clear. All of the remote's functions worked perfectly and that is the main reason why I chose this model. I was teetering between these and the 215s which most likely have a better sound but, disappointingly, lack the microphone and remote.

Overall the buds were a great buy for the price tag. If you're searching for a good sounding pair of in-ears with a microphone (sorry Android, iPhone only) then I'd highly recommend these."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good build quality and near complete sound isolation. Very good sound quality and a value for the price. The instructions suggest that the ear buds can be worn with the wire wrapped around the ear, but I found the cable a bit to firm to stay around the ear. Luckily the buds are light enough to be comfortably worn directly."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeh, well, this is ok stuff but do not listen to better and as for sound isolating, maybe 10 db. Wear on the bicycle is good, but does not cut noise well enough on a motorcycle with a full face helmet and no fairing/windshield over 30mph. Great in the tight, technical twisties at low speed, good, not great, bass."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceeds expectations. Rugged built, easy access to volume controls. Good frequency response and sound isolation. The dollar to performance pricing is right on. Shure has done it again along with classics such as the V-15 Type4 phono cartridge and the SM57/58. No hissing or spitting on the highs and some power on the lows with no rumble."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say that to me the headphones are good enough. It isolates external noises pretty well and fits very well in my ears. The only thing that I don't like it's that while playing (I use them as my personal monitor), it seems the headphones are going to fall off. Besides that, I think they are very good."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with these headphones. The quality is terrific, and I am impressed with the isolation such small buds provide."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well-balanced sound quality - not too much bass, and it seems relatively flat, which is what I expected and wanted. They're a little bit large for my ears as compared to some previous earphones, but I get a good seal for the most part despite this. Construction seems very solid, and the remote/microphone is convenient. All around, I consider these a solid mid-range earphone and a huge upgrade over typical earbuds."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SE112 earphones, so I like the sound, but my left earbud has stopped working after only 5+ months of moderate use! My first pair still work well after years of use. I bought this new pair in February because of the straight jack - it connects better to my iPhone and my iPad when in their respective protective cases. I am bummed! Now I must figure out if and how I can replace this pair under warranty."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use these on stage and the sound is great.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear phones were fine while they were working. The sound quality was not great and I had to speak directly into the microphone on calls in order for it to work. The biggest problem though, was that they broke after just 3 months with sound only coming out of one ear."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are the least expensive of the high end ear buds. For the price they are excellent and provide good sound and excellent stereo separation. They seem to be constructed very well and I use them in bed with no problems. All in all they are hardy and provide excellent sound quality. I am very happy with them and would purchase them again if needed.
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left side output is intermittent after about a dozen uses over a 2 month period. My stock iphone headset is more consistent than this. Left side went about 2/3 down in volume during a gig last weekend while using click track. Brought it home, worked OK once, then next use the left volume was down again. Can't use it for intended purpose... Verified issue with multiple devices."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as full in the audible sound spectrum as I had anticipated, but a novel idea in sturdier construction of the wires. Hopefully this is the beginning of less flimsy relatively inexpensive ear buds. They are comfortable in the ear."
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a long time Shure earphone user. I got these to go with my new iPhone as I wanted the Mic + remote control. The sound is very good given the price (yes the higher model Shure's sound better) and the remote works perfectly with my iPhone.
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are quite honestly the best and most comfortable earbuds I've ever used. While the microphone/remote control falls short on how it works, I honestly love the pair. The only main problems I've encountered with these are that they seem to fall out pretty easily but it isn't that big of an issue. I would not use these earbuds for working out by any means. Along with that, it seems the only earbud tips you can replace these with are the ones which come with the pair you received."
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"the android capabilities are limited to pause and unpause; the volume buttons don't do anything. If I had known that, i'd have saved myself a few bucks and got the version WITHOUT the non-functioning remote."

5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Already had the shure se215's,and I purchased the se112's to see how much of a difference there is! The se112's are on par if not a little better than my $50 and under earbuds which I have now! Don't like the cheap felt case it came with! Found a small plastic case with a pouch to put the cleaning kit and earbuds in! As far as the se215's go,they've got an amazing sound that's a smaller version of an on ear in your ear! The se215's are the first earbuds that I ever had that blew me away! They have a decent soft case to put your earbuds,and pouch inside to put your cleaning case in! Don't buy the se112's,instead spend a few more dollars for the se215's, you'll thank me later! Mar1,2016 update: I'm warming up to these alot more after listening to them for a couple of days now! I like these alot now,but like I said,I'd still go ahead and pay the extra $50 for extra clarity and overall sound,but that being said I still like both! These are my first 2 pairs of shure earphones and hopefully I won't have cable issues like a good percentage of the people have!"
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have these hooked into my SENA SMH-10's earbud baseplate. They work great at keeping the excess wind noise out and sound awesome to boot. Makes carrying on HAM radio conversations at speed easy.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited to write a review for the earphones as I wanted to see the performance over a longer period. It's been 11 months since I bought them .i bought two pairs, one for a friend. Both of us experienced the same issue .one of the earbuds stopped working (1 set after 8 months, 2 set After 11 months). I am not sure how long earphones usually last but less than a year should not be the norm. Apart from that, I thought the earphones were great ,had a great sound quality for the price. If you are a runner, you might want to consider other earphones as it kept falling of but not as frequently as my apple earphones."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones! I have used them daily for a few weeks now. I use them with Comply foam tips. The sound is nice and balanced. There is plenty of bass without it being overpowering. They also block most of the outside noise (great on the subway).
The cable and remote are solid. I wish they had memory cables for the over the ear portion, but they are very comfortable nevertheless."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate it because the right ear bud stopped working after three months. I took good care of them, but there's not much you can do about a manufacturing problem. It's hard to like something that doesn't work. Oh, and conveniently, I can't return them after a month..."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,this is my 3rd pair of Shure ear buds. These are the worst and would not recommend. The cords to the ear buds do not 'mold' around the ear and one earbud wire keeps flying off of my ear if I turn my head. The manufacture of this earbud is very disappointing.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Grandson was very happy with the earbuds. He uses them for gaming and says that they really isolate the room noise well. They are not noise cancelling, but fit so well that they really keep the noise down."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"work great. i got these originally to use with an in-ear system, but ended up using them with a Roland SPD-SX electronic drum / sample pad and they are solid. good quality build and audio. can't complain"
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband loves them, he says they isolate him from all the surrounding noises very well while he is working."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is excellent. It has three different sized earpieces but I am still struggling to find the right size that will stay in my ear while running. The earpiece is longer than my previous earphones and fits further into the ear than I like.
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Extraordinarily good sound for the price. Much better than your standard apple/skull candy/beats earbuds for the same price. Only complaint is that the cones that are included don't fit everybody's ears, so you may need to purchase third party cones. Once they fit right, the noice cancelation and sound is impeccable for the price."
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sounding headphones. They do a good job of blocking out my employees when they are trying to complain to me. My only gripe is the clip broke shortley after getting them. I suppose it's to be expected with plastic though.
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound and hands free option from the most reputable company in consumer and professional audio products.
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,very handy & good pricepoint
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones sound great... They really do. But the fit is awful no matter which sized ear piece I used. I found the instructions for how they are supposed to fit over the ear but the piece still falls off even when I'm just sitting in one spot. Even worse is using these at the gym or while running where they're impossible to keep in the ear, especially when you begin to sweat"
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,The audio quality could have been a bit better for the price point. I would have kept it had it not been defective. The controls only worked intermittently.
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, let me say that I'm a huge fan of Shure. I have tried a number of their products, and in terms of build quality and a lot of times sound quality, they are hard to beat. Seeing that these are in a new (cheaper) category for Shure, they had to make some sacrifices. Those sacrifices come mainly in the sound department. That is not to say these sound bad, just under par for what one would expect from Shure.

Build

Like I said, it's hard to beat the build quality of these headphones. The cable is nice and thick, there is hefty strain relief at the points where it counts.The thick cable does a great job at keeping them untangled. This is the kind of headphone you will likely lose before they break. There are no detachable cables, as you would see on the higher end of the SE line, but at $50 it just doesn't pay to buy a new set of replacement cables for $30. However, you will likely not have any issues with the cable unless you are prone to slicing at your headphones with a knife. They also come with a small pouch, which will do the job, but isn't the most elegant solution out there.

Comfort

Personally, I really like the feel of these headphones. Although Shure says these are meant to be worn ear bud style, I would recommend getting used to wearing them behind your ear. If worn ear bud style, they just feel like they will fall out of your ears. Once you get used to putting the wire behind your ear, you will probably not go back. It provides a nice security, and helps reduce cable noise. One thing that is not often talked about is the ear buds themselves. The tips Shure provides are some of the best silicone tips I have ever used. They do a nice job at isolating sound, and just feel nice!

Sound Quality

They aren't bad, but they aren't the best in this price category. These have some nice mids, and decent highs, but they low end seems a bit muddy. They do have a similar warm tone to the SE215s, but you wont get the deep bass or some of the clear highs as found in some others at this price. They just don't have the kind of range you would expect from a Shure product. They do a great job at isolating sound, but not quite as good as the step above.

Overall

These are for someone who values build quality over sound quality. These won't WOW the audiophiles out there, but they will outlast almost any other offering at this price. If you want something with better highs, go for the M6 Pros. If you want something with better overall sound quality, go with the V Sonic VSD3S. If you want a pair that you can use and abuse with no worries, I would go for the SE112s. If you have the extra money to shell out, I would recommend going with the SE215s. The addition of detachable cables, the nicer zip case and the better sound make them well worth the extra money."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for everyday use
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blocks out outside noise as well as awesome sound - watch out you might blow out your eardrums on a song you like. All in all well made and I'm happy with my purchase - - - so far only 1 day. But I also bought the protection plan just in case.
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked this earphones. I don't really know that much about acoustics, bass and that kind of stuff but I think they comply with the isolating function. What I didn't like that much was that the cable was too wide for what I am used to have but I hope that means more durability and I also didn't like that the mic and volume thing is too big if it were more little I would really liked them more but overall I think they are okay. I'm sure out there you can find a wide variety of earphones for a lower price."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work perfectly
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously one of the best earphones I've heard at this price range. I can't speak highly enough about the absolute clarity of all ranges, including the bass. Just beautiful."
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed in these. There is NO bass and it is treble overload. I purchased because they said enhanced bass. I have an old pair of v-moda that sound way better.

Also, they will not stay in my ears. I have tried for about an hour but the way they have you put the cord over your ears is impossible and uncomfortable."
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality was quite good. I could never get them to stay in my ears very well, however. The reason for the negative review is because the right ear stopped working after about 8 months of light use. Really disappointing."
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need to return them but havent had the chance, the right side keeps cutting out on me, when i jiggle the cord then it works."
0,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery is good. Gives more than 6 hours in one charge. Charge pretty quickly as well. One problem is it is too long. So it hangs out a bit below neck. Not a terrible problem but it would be better if it was little shorter
1,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound much better than cheaper headphones and they last longer. The main cord is thicker than most similar headphones, which makes them more durable and harder to tangle. A small pouch is included, which makes it even less likely they will tangle. I have actually heard new layers in songs I have heard thousands of times before. My son went through 3 cheaper headphones and these were still good, so I bought him his own."
2,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is not as good as expected and the sound level is unsteady. Forward button does not work consistently. Have it for two weeks and going to retire it.
3,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits great, blocks out almost all sounds (when listening to something), and I use them constantly on planes and in the office. Liked them so much that I bought another pair. Note: these replaces a pair of Klipsch Reference Series ear buds that I hated."
4,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair had gotten worn, but needed to update. Really good at isolating background noise. Comfortable in my ears too."
5,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones out there on the market.
6,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was happy with these headphones, but after 4 months they will no longer pair with my cell phone, so they are useless. Too much money for something that stopped working so quickly"
7,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product and great service!
8,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty fair earbuds, but I wasn't really enthused as the driver seemed to lack the deep rich sounds I have with other headphones"
9,Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely excellent earphones. They hold up well to near-constant use and do a great job blocking out exterior sound as well as just sounding great. I moved to these after a number of years using cheaper earbuds and have not looked back. Worth the investment!
