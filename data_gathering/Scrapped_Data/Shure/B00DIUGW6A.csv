0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First things first $1000 for a pair of iems or “earbuds” is insane beyond belief…. people will look at you like you have five heads so I don’t advertise the cost of these ever. Is it worth it though? Let’s get to that.

Accessories:
I am not going to spend much time going over this as the accessories are listed here in detail on amazon and on shure’s site. To put it simply there is everything you need. You get a bunch of ear tips, a case to carry the headphones, adapters, two different length cables, case to carry all the accessories etc. There is nothing else you need to buy, the cables are fantastic, there is no aftermarket cable needed. I didn’t need comply foam tips, there are lots of tips included here.

Design/build quality:
Build quality is rock solid. Much, much better than the 535. There is no weak part to the iems. The iems fit over your ear with memory wire. I have oddly shaped ears and typically have trouble with over ear iems however these fit perfectly. I was able to get a tight seal with the middle size included rubber tip and the sound isolation is unreal. There is no disruption from outside noise at all and with music playing I can’t hear anything. I have never seen isolation this good, just make sure you get a tight fit.

One thing very important to point out is the nozel inserts. These iems come with three nozel inserts, bright (slightly geared toward higher frequencies), neutral (balanced), warm (slightly geared toward lower frequencies). When I got these I immediately changed them to the warm inserts based on reviews. It wasn’t very difficult to change them but definitely take your time and have an open work space. Shure’s directions are very detailed.

Comfort: These are very comfortable and stay put in your ears. By comfort I don’t mean like pillows for your ears or forget you’re wear them sort of comfort but there is no pain or discomfort caused by them. I have worn them for hours with no issues.

These do NOT need an amp. To be clear with a 9 ohm impedance (the lowest I’ve ever seen) you will likely damage your ears, your amp, and these iems trying to use an amp. Using an ipod, phone, or anything with a quality internal dac is all you need. The incredibly low impedance is the result of essentially a built in amplifier which pushes the 4 drivers incredibly well.

Sound quality:
Unreal, magical, pure bliss. To give a little background I am a studio headphones nut. I don’t claim to be an audiophile because there are people far more qualified to use that term than I am but I am an audio enthusiast and I have, for a very long time, loved headphones. My go to line of headphones is Sennhiesers HD line (600/650/700/800). These headphones have massive drivers, require a quality amp/dac setup/aftermarket cable, and are not portable but to me it is worth it for the unbelievable sound and soundstage they put out. I have never been a huge fan of iems or earbuds aside from convenience because they will never deliver the wide-open soundstage, layering, or detail that a pair of studio headphones will…. until now.
The soundstage and layering of these iems is unbelievable. If you could not feel them in your ears you’d swear you had an open back pair of over ear headphones on. The spatial soundstage here is unreal. There isn’t a word to describe how large and spacious it is. There is so much open airiness to these and again the layering and separation, dreamlike. They are incredibly balanced, crystal clear treble, perfectly present mids and the bass. I am not a fan of bass heavy anything, the bass should be replicated naturally and not give you a headache. The bass here is deep, very detailed, and punches deeply when the song calls for it. Warm, beautiful, open. Not a detail is missed, nothing is rolled off, nothing is overemphasized. Even at low volumes these things project an insane amount. Unreal.

The sound quality here is honestly like a 15/10. This may just be the first flawless sounding headphone I’ve ever heard.

So is it worth the money? Well IMO it is well worth it if you love your music and are thoroughly dedicated about your headphones. It is a lot of money to spend and I heavily questioned buying these for awhile before I took the plunge and continued to question while I waited for them to come however I can safely say I have no regrets. They’re incredibly portable and more than driven by your portable device. No pair of headphones is worth going broke over but if you have the money I can’t imagine anyone not being thrilled with these.

Hope this has helped anyone deciding on whether or not to buy these. Cheers."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside from a few exceptions, this is the pinnacle of IEMs guys. This is it. It comes at an astronomical price that might even make you pass out at just one look, but sometimes if you want the best, you do whatever it takes to get it. Also, I got these in early June of this year, so I've had about 6 months to form my opinions.

I got the box from the mail and I didn't even realize that it was my earphones. I opened the cardboard box to see the initial packaging. It is the biggest box I have ever seen for earphones. I opened it and saw the clear pelican case. I opened that and found a micro-fiber cleaning cloth on top of the earphones and the smaller case they come with. Many of the accessories are in the case such as the ear tips, extra cable, airplane adaptor, quarter inch adapter, and tuning filters.

I ordered the Black color and I'm so glad I did because they look ""all business"". Right off the bat, I pick them up and I can immediately tell that these are no joke. The cable is thick with really good strain reliefs on the y-split and on the jack. The metal nozzle on the housing leaves me feeling a little better about long term durability. The comfort of these is really good. I use the yellow foam sleeves and have had no issues with fit, sound, or comfort. From walking to class to class, to when I'm at home, to being in any loud environment, these things block out so much noise.

The sound of these is expected when paying $1000. After paying that much, expectations are near impossible to exceed. Did it exceed my expectations? No. Did it reach my expectations? Yes it did in a big way. Before I start, I want to say that I am listening to ALAC files and Spotify 320 kb/s and listening through the Oppo HA-2SE. Also my opinions are based off the white filters because they sound the best to me. The bass is tight, punchy, and it has ""true subwoofer performance"". It's actually my favorite part about this earphone. I can hear every nuance and every detail in every bass note. I can't say that with anything else I've listened to. The mid-bass doesn't interfere with the midrange with the help of the Low-Pass filter. The midrange is forward compared to the bass and treble. Listening to Pop, Country, Alternative, and some Rock is a pleasure to listen to. The treble is my least favorite part of the sound. It's detailed and it's clear, but it doesn't extend high enough for my liking. It's not a bad treble response, it's just not what I prefer. Some enjoy this, but when I'm listening to Classical, Soundtrack, and some Rock music, I want a treble that has more of a presence to increase the soundstage. One aspect that stands out in the sound of this earphone is the vocals. They are the best I've heard bar none. Male and female vocals are well presented. They are natural, full, and clean all at the same time. I bet there are a few other earphones that sound better than this, but the combination of the sub-bass, midrange, and vocals is downright addicting to listen to.

This and the Sennheiser IE800 are often compared to each other, but in reality, they are more different than they are alike. They are so different it's hilarious that these are even being compared against each other. They are aimed for different types of buyers. I'll make my recommendations here. If you are active and listen to music mainly on the go, then SE846. If you listen to music more at home or in bed, then IE800. If you listen to Pop, Electronic, Hip-Hop/Rap, Country, and/or Alternative music, then SE846. If you listen to Classical, Singer/Songwriter, Soundtrack, R&B/Soul, and/or Rock, then IE800. Overall, if you listen to any genre and all you care about is sound in an earphone, then IE800. If you want a earphone that comes with everything and has little flaws, then SE846.

If you want the best overall experience for a universal earphone in this price range, this is probably the best you can do. It has a nice presentation, stellar build quality, top tier sound, and accessories to go along with all this. If you're thinking about getting these, take a while to think about it. You're spending $1000 on earphones. You have to be completely insane to spend this much on an earphone. Spend time to decide and whatever you decide to do, enjoy your music and live your life to the absolute fullest."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned the range of Shure's previous IEMs, I was thrilled when the SE-846 was released back in 2013. I bought them as soon as they were released and have been listening to them ever since. I travel internationally at least 6 months out of the year and work on oil rigs. When I say that these headphones are durable, I believe that to be a qualified statement. The sound quality: they are better than anything else Shure makes or AKG or Westone or UE. Compared to my SE-535s these are in a whole different realm of sound quality. I've not listened to any other headphone (including open back electrostats) that more faithfully reproduces the nuances of an upright bass played as part of a jazz trio. Fat, throat-vibrating bass while not sounding boomy or overly presented. On some Charlie Haden tracks, you can hear the texture of his fingers on the strings. Detailed playback? Yeah the 846s have it. These headphones, much like the SE-535s, have excellent dimensionality. You quickly forget your wearing something in your ears. The sound stage is wide and not at all muddied. Good live recordings sound like your right there. Check out Stacey Kent's Dreamer in Concert album for a good demonstration of this. You'll best appreciate this when listening to FLAC files but even 320kb/s sounds good.
Bottom line: If you want the best portable audio setup for under $3,000 start off with buying the SE846 IEMs. Buy right once, cry once. I mostly use Apple iPhone or MacBooks to listen. I used to carry a standalone DAC/amp combo but I don't even bother anymore. The headphones powered by the iPhone 6+ and now 7+ (via adapter) are plenty good enough to still sound better than anything else I've tried and I try out a LOT of headphones."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Settle in with some coffee or tea cause this is going to be a long one...

;-)

Shure IEM's have been my mainstay daily listening choice for quite a few years now. I bought my first pair of Shure IEM's back in 2007, a pair of E4C's that I (amazingly) found for $100.00 at my local circuit city.

From the get go, the Shure house tendency towards neutrality and not over emphasizing any particular frequency really sat well with both my inner music producer, as well as my inner listener. I'm not a fan of exaggerated or unnaturally affected music in regards to any frequency range, really and if given my druthers, I would always have gear that tends towards neutral but that still responds well should I decide to use equalization.

Therefore, at least in regards to IEM's, I've always stuck with the Shure brand as the engineers (and ears) there, those behind the design process of their headphones, IEM's and even their microphones (I own several), seem most concerned with a natural, mostly unaffected presentation.

From the E4C's, I rather quickly moved on to the SE500's, then the SE530's and then the SE535's. I've enjoyed them all immensely and for mostly the same consistent reasons: solid performance, nothing exaggerated, clean detailed presentation and excellent build quality (not to mention their excellent service department).

Here come the SE846
---------------------------------------------------

And so when the SE846 was released, especially with the accompanying “hoopla” around the considerable amount of new technology that went in to the production of the IEM (in-house engineered balanced armature drivers, a miniature ported sub woofer of sorts with 4 inches of acoustic pathway, etc.) … admittedly, I was over the moon and just hell bent on the need to try them.

But when I saw the price of $1000.00, I realized this was an item that most likely would not end up as part of my regular, daily arsenal. And, for all intents and purposes, it has not. Something about spending $1000.00 on an IEM just throws some internal checks and balances that have simply not allowed me to actually try (or buy) a set.

But lately, I was lucky enough to get to spend a couple weeks with a brand new pair of SE846 IEM's and as a long time and quite devout user of the various 500 series IEM's, I figured I'd take a moment to write a bit about my experience with them.

Solid
----------------------------------------------

When listening to non-equalized music, The SE535's have always been just a tad to much on the “flat” side of things, a bit too “middle of the road,” a bit to “straight-laced.” This is fantastic from a music production point of view as it allows me to hear music for what it is and without any affectations brought on by the IEM itself (should I care to have a “clinical” listen to any given sort of music). But in daily use, I have always insisted on using equalization to bring the default, somewhat subdued presentation of the SE535 more in to focus in regards to what I enjoy insofar as recreational music listening is concerned. It's true as well, as you've most likely read or heard, the SE535 has fairly rolled off, stunted highs that I can only imagine were decided upon to make the IEM most palatable with the most sorts/genres of music. But in the final analysis, I enjoy a bit more sparkle than the SE535's naturally provide and too, I like a bit more sub bass and bass presence in general. Therefore, I've always used equalization with them. Currently, I use a Cowon J3 with it's formidable Jetaudio EQ to fine tune the SE535's and prior to the Cowon, a Teclast S:flo 2 with an Arrow amp's bass/treble boost.

And so the primary difference I would note between the SE535 and the SE846 is that the SE846 requires NO equalization to sound “right” to my ear. In fact, at all default/non-EQ'd settings, the SE846 sounds about like my SE535's with equalization applied. And yet, for various other reasons discussed below, the SE846 still sounds markedly more impressive for several other reasons.

SE535 vs SE846 … a general breakdown
---------------------------------------------------

The SE535's, in general, sound a bit more “flat line” or “homogenized” than do the SE846's. I think this has everything to do with the rather dramatically better instrument isolation/separation that the four drivers of the SE846 provide. The two IEM's are without a doubt from the same basic tuning camp, they are both somewhat neutral and neither overly accentuate any given frequency; with the SE846, I never found myself thinking, “wow, those highs are too bright,” or … “that bass is totally unnatural (think Bose)” … but Shure really took things to the next level with the SE846's and they are a fantastic successor to the ubiquitous SE535 if only for the fact that they solve two of the most obvious issues with the SE535 (to my ear, mind you): first, the rolled off highs and second, the lack of a visceral sub bass.

I just wish they'd have released them at a closer price point to the SE535's instead of basically doubling the price, but that's just my limited income and other interests (that require my money) talking. :-)

But it's true. Take every criticism you've heard regarding the SE500 series IEM's and just imagine them all rectified. That's what the SE846 brings to the table. It's not just the superior bass performance of the SE846 (which is significant), it's the high frequency presence, the sound staging, the instrument separation and micro detail retrieval, it's everything really. The improvement over the SE535, really is that significant of a thing. I have listened to the various 500 series Shure IEM's nearly every single day for 4 to 6 hours a day and for the past six years; I am intimately acquainted with them and the above comments are made with a good deal of confidence. The SE846 is a real evolutionary step away from the Shure SE535's.

But as mentioned, they definitely hail from the same sonic camp...

The one area I think the two IEM's are most similar is in regard to mid range frequencies. Upon first listening to the SE846, I was very happy to hear that Shure decided to stay with the (my opinion) utterly brilliant, somewhat forward and very present take on mid range that just about all of their headphones/IEM's are known for. I like my bass and I like my highs but I think somebody once said that the music is in the mid range and I for one, would tend to agree. The SE846 mid range is nearly indistinguishable from the SE535 mid range, if not just a tad more refined around the edges. Couldn't be more happy about that and the huge improvements in overall frequency retrieval and separation make the SE846 almost a perfect headphone for me.

Lows
---------------------------------------------------

And as most every review will mention, the bass performance of the SE846 is rather astonishing. However the Shure design team came up with that ingenious (and gorgeous) sub woofer-like “porting” system, whereby they give the bass frequencies, literally, four inches of metallic path to trace before exiting the tiny IEM's sound tubes, is beyond me but I can say they've worked a minor miracle with it as the bass performance is the best I've heard from any IEM.

It is not an overwhelming, huge, constantly present bass like one might hear in some of the “bass head” cans out there on the market; unless the particular track calls for it, you will never even know such potential is dormant there, but should any given track need it? The bass comes and it comes in just that amount that the track/recording calls for and is always in perfect relation to the high frequencies and the mid range frequencies. That last bit is perhaps the most astonishing facet of the SE846, the fact that at any volume, from the subtlest of settings to the loudest, the SE846 remains absolutely well behaved, with everything in it's place. The bass never bleeds into or drowns out the highs/mids and the mids, though generally always the backbone of the Shure IEM sound (any of them), never dominate in a way that seems outside the requirement of the given track/recording. I sat one day for over an hour just turning the volume way down and way up, marveling at how in the world they kept the relationship between highs/mids/lows so consistently perfect no matter how loud or soft the volume became, truly a feat.

But the bass is ridiculously good and miles beyond anything the SE535 is capable of. I consistently use equalization to give my SE535's just that little bit of extra something at both ends of the frequency spectrum as they are just so “flat line” that at times I find them to be a bit boring … not so with the SE846, though. Straight out of the Ibasso DX90, with no equalization, the SE846 are pretty much perfect sounding to this guys ear and I had no need or desire to equalize them in the slightest.

Highs
---------------------------------------------------

Another quality often discussed regarding the SE535 is the obviously rolled off high frequencies. I don't think it is debatable at this point, either for reasons of sounding the best with the most types of music or otherwise attempting to make them non-fatiguing, the SE535's are designed with a rather pronounced “roll-off” of the upper high frequencies. This isn't altogether bad as they can be easily massaged with a decent equalizer if one prefers more sparkle (I do); should one have a player with a decent equalizer (think Cowon J3) then that can be remedied; or worse case scenario? Should one be stuck with an exceptional player that has a pretty bad equalizer (think Ibasso DX90), then it can become vexing.

But again, as a person who has lived with the SE535's for many, many years and many thousands of listening hours, I can happily say that the SE846's are much more resolving and have far more sparkly, ­more detailed high frequencies. Everything about the high frequencies is more resolving and more detailed.

I would put a section here discussing the mid range but suffice it to say, the SE846 come with the same, rather pronounced and “confident” mid range presentation that the SE535's and most other Shure headphones count as hallmark. I for one was very pleased to hear this as I'm a big fan of a leading mid range and nothing else can really be said about it other than the fact that the SE846 presents that same mid range in an even more detailed, articulate manner (most likely having everything to do with more drivers).

Otherwise?
---------------------------------------------------

Sound staging is a bit more out of the head than the SE535's … the increased number of drivers and perhaps the design of the housings, give one the impression of the music coming from a slightly greater distance (in a pleasant way).

The SE846 is a noticeably more detailed/resolving IEM than the SE535, presenting music with a much greater, more discreet separation among the various instruments in any given bit of music; this is not a subtle thing, either. There is more “silence” between the various players and overall, one finds one's self more intimately experiencing the sonic landscape. An interesting thing is that as I would switch from the SE846 back to the SE535, I had a very intense and nagging desire to keep turning the SE535's volume up, thinking that if I did so, I would be able to hear the same sort of details I was getting via the SE846; but increasing the volume thru the SE535 just didn't assuage that nagging itch; in the end, I realized it was simply a matter of the SE846 being a much more resolving listen and there was no issue or discrepancy with the volume setting when switching between the two IEM's. Apparently, the number of drivers and overall design differences inherent to the SE846, really do make a very positive difference.

-- Using the Shure “black olives” the noise isolation was identical between the two IEM's (and quite remarkable, as always with that particular tip).

-- The fit of the SE846 was approximate with that of the SE535's, even though the SE846 is without a doubt a bit larger of an IEM; still, I had no issue with the fit (my ears are what you might call “medium” sized).

-- The build quality of the SE846 is something out of an Engineering or Industrial Design periodical, I mean it's a freakishly gorgeous bit of gear to look at with a magnifying glass. :-) … the cables are ridiculously tough and well put together (microphonic free, BTW) and overall the entire package screams quality.

-- I did not experiment with the various nozzles that reportedly can be used to change the sound; I found the default, “neutral” setup to be so perfect that I didn't have any desire to try the other options and so I can't speak towards that.

-- I did not test the SE846 with any sort of amplifier; they sounded brilliant straight from my Cowon J3 and even better, straight out of the Ibasso DX90.

Why I won't be keeping this $1000.00 pair of IEMs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, I simply cannot drop a grand on a bit of gear that only has a 2 year warranty.

Despite my appreciation of Shure Inc. … their microphones and headphones alike, both of which I have used extensively over the past two decades … I still feel that such a device as the SE846's should come with a warranty that more syncs with the rather heady price tag. Again, I have nothing but love for Shure and their business methodology; for chrissake, they sent me a completely free pair of brand new SE530's once ... simply because I wrote an honest letter to their service department, but that's another thread …

But the fact remains, a 2 year warranty is basically the same as Shure saying, “Hey .. we think that these might very well fail after about two years of regular use and if so, your either going to have to buy a new pair or pay for repairs.” And, for a $1000.00 pair of inner ear monitors, this is simply unacceptable for me as a consumer. I'll just EQ my SE535's, thank you very much. ;-)

Something I didn't write anything about in the above little essay is that throughout my listening session, I was also swapping in a set of Koss Portapros for even further comparison and I have to say, they are damn near the sonic equal of the SE846's; and, to my ear, a decent bit more exciting of a listen than the non-equalized SE535's. Very similar bass/high freq performance as the SE846's but without the lovely isolation of the latter, and of course not nearly as discreet/portable. And if folks feel that paying $1000 bucks for the 846's is better than $40 bucks for the Koss Portapros or even $500 bucks for the SE535's (both of which I consider fair) … then more power to them. Technically and to make sure the above comparison is understood, the Koss Portapros are not nearly as detailed as the SE846; further, the highs and lows of the Koss' are tipped just so much more towards the “unnatural” … but they are coming close to the sonic performance of the SE846 and so at $40.00 and change, and with a lifetime warranty? It makes dropping a grand on the SE846's sort of hard to justify (even though I still want them real bad) … ;-)

But again, can't say it enough … the Portapros, even at a mere $40 bucks, still have a life time warranty (which I've used more than once). Hell, even the $1000 dollar Koss ESP-950 kit comes with a life time warranty, which I've also used on more than one occasion.

Ultimately?
------------------------------------------

Shure has done a genuinely remarkable thing with the design/engineering behind the SE846 and I certainly feel the price is okay for such work and especially the resulting performance; if you have the coin to spare and want pretty much the best sonics one can find today in the market of universal fit IEM's? Then buy the Shure SE846 immediately and feel good about buying them. I certainly would if I could and I might still, anyway ... if I can just find somebody who might want to buy one of my kids (just kidding, I don't have any kids but selling one still comes to mind and as I try and juggle responsibilities in an attempt to justify buying the SE846's for real)

If the SE846 IEM's had a life time warranty? I would buy them happily, immediately and without hesitation. Hell, even if the warranty was five years instead of two, I'd still buy them. Shiza! Just look at Blendteq blenders! They build a remarkable product as well (Blendteq is like the Shure SE846 of blenders!) and they back it with a very respectable 8 year warranty and those only cost about $500.00 bucks! But I digress ..

Much of this last bit of playful vitriol is just my annoyance at not allowing myself to keep the SE846's (really, I'm bugged to hell). It's been a couple weeks since I returned them to Amazon and every time I put my SE535's in, I'm immediately reminded of how superior of an IEM the SE846's are.

The pain is real...

Further, the sonic differences between the SE535 and the SE846, though quite significant, simply do not warrant a $1000.00 upgrade when considering my other interests that require financing and my relative income level as well. I really enjoy the SE535's and combined with a clean, capable EQ, they can be made to quite nearly approximate the general frequency performance of the SE846, though the better separation among frequencies and the better isolation of individual players that are hallmarks of the SE846 sound, simply cannot be matched by the SE535 with any sort of hardware or software equalization; it is a simple matter of better physical engineering and design (great job, Shure!!).

So yes. I will pine for the SE846's for some time and yes, I sorely wish that Shure had released them closer to the price point of the SE535's or even so, a much better warranty term when priced at their current $1000.00.

But at the same time I'm hugely pleased with Shure's innovation and the quality of the product that they chose to make and introduce to the audio market, both for those of us making the music and for those of us who listen.

Keep up the great work, Shure. I remain a fan....

4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best earphones for $1000, probably better than other IEMs above $1000.00. I've been using it for 11 months now, dropped it twice, and it's still working. This doesn't deserve below 5 stars, as others reviewed it. In fact, it deserved more than 5 stars.

I also replaced the cables with my Shure SRH1540 cables (yes, it's compatible), because I love black, and to give emphasis on the transparent IEMs. I also tried 2 different filters, and now I'm using the black one. There should be 3 different filters, but my white filter is missing its partner. I only received 2 blue filters, 2 black filters, and 1 white filter. I think they missed to include it in the package. Anyway, I didn't complain about it. I just love the black filters and the blue one, even though I haven't tried the white one.

I connected it to my PS4 via Soundblaster E5 using an Optical Cable, and it sounded majestic. I felt like I'm inside the game while playing Uncharted 4. The bass is incredibly awesome! You'll feel it like your heart beats bass. There's nothing more I can say with the SE846. I'm just impressed. Really impressed.

I also tried the various eartips included in the package, and I just love the long white one, the one they call ""Triple Flange Sleeves"". This doesn't give you the best sound isolation (The default one does) but this eartips will make you listen to your music in your head, not in your ears. It's like the band is singing inside your brain, while you listen to your favorite band. Or the movie is inside your head, if you're watching your favorite movie with the SE846. The feeling is immersive, like VR."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually gush over a product I review. I'm usually fairly picky and can find at least a few issues that would need improving. Not this time!
These IEMs score top marks in every category for me:

Pros:

1) Sound isolation with Shure's foam tips is almost exactly like that of the Etymotic ER4S - the best I've ever heard in terms of NRR.
2) Excellent frequency response, which doesn't neglect the treble or the sub-bass. The low-frequencies sound as good, or better than that of dynamic drivers like the Sennheiser IE 800. This is very impressive for balanced armature drivers.
3) They sound crystal clear - clarity and articulation across the whole frequency range.
4) Given their bulk and weight, they're surprisingly comfortable - certainly the most comfortable IEMs I've ever used. You could easily sleep with them on.
5) They come with three sets of filters to fine-tune the FR to fit your own personal preference (black = warm, blue = neutral, white = bright).
6) They have thin posts, which allow a big choice of aftermarket tips, should you want to experiment. However, the Shure foams are the best tips I've ever used on an IEM. (I've used these for years with many other Shure and non-Shure IEMs.)
7) The posts are made of metal, and they need to be, because those Shure foam tips do not want to come off those posts! (I'd previously had bad experiences with plastic posts snapping on other Shure model IEMs.)

Cons:

I really can't think of any. Price is the only thing that might leave me hesitant to recommend them to everybody. For those that aren't as serious about audio, the Monster Turbine Pro Copper comes very close in terms of sound signature and articulation, but doesn't have the comfort or isolation of the 846. (However, you can now pick up a pair of Coppers for about 1/4 of the price of the 846.) I also can't comment on QC, because I've only had one pair. If they break or stop working, I'll post back, but for now, I'm very happy with these.

P.S. One very important comment I forgot to make. These IEMs sound great at any volume level. That's critical, because when you're directing 100% of that acoustic energy at your eardrum, you need to keep that volume low in order to protect your hearing."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these today. Wow. Packaging has been scaled down very much. No longer includes a pelican case. The box is no longer ""rubberized"". Now, it's very ordinary with a foam insert and everything shoved into the earphone case. The out-of-the-box attached wire also has short. When attached to my phone, audio cuts in an out when the plug-in end moves. I tested with my year old wire, and they worked fine. So, also seems quality control has degraded. What a disappointment for $1000 earphones.

The box from the first pair also had a serial no. and manufactured date. This new pair has neither---nothing says ""serial number"" nor a date. Maybe it's coded now. I'm assuming I got a recent one and not a refurb or returned item.

Update:
Just noticed in Amazon's listing it does show that it (still) comes with the clear pelican type case. There's a pic that is subtitle ""comfort""----my packaging did not include this item. My SEs come from UTM Inc. I'll be returning them since they're 1) defective wire and 2) misrepresenting what comes included. Bummer."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay what can I say I had my doubts but wow was I wrong. Hearing these things compared to some of my other set up kind of makes me wonder why I wasted so much money on the others. I don't know the magic shure did but these SE846 were just magical. Everything you want from high end earphone and even high end headphones were in these earphones the soundstage is surprising large when you compare them to other makers. Plus the ability to customize your sound as just frosting on top of the cake. With each filter you could customize them to be what you wanted them to be making them that much more personal to you. Of course try out all the ear tips as you might not like the ones that it came with but I gotta say though the one that they are packed with were really nice. Fit right in but I had to change them out as there were a little bit to big for me. If you are looking for some hifi earphones and are already on the market looking for customs then check these out before you go customs because you might just find out that these are much better for the price.
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now we're talking! Best IEDs to be stuffed in my ears as of yet. I also have the Japanese version of the SE535s and they are way too bright so those will go back, I did not try the regular SE535 which are reportedly much better balanced and you can get filters right from digikey for cheap. I decided to go more than double or nothing and got these instead despite the high price. These things (SE846) have amazing headroom and are very efficient, great bass, not boomy or too exaggerated, detail, clarity, imaging (really called power response officially) as well as high end without any tizz or sibilance, most important is that these have none of the nails on the chalkboard sonics in the upper midrange of far far too many transducers of any kind. I can barely touch the volume on an AudioEngine D1 being fed by a Squeezebox Touch. I was close to getting custom IEDs but decided to give these a good try. I also own an AudioQuest Dragonfly Red. These also sounded great being fed from a Samsung S7E.

To do, I'll try them with my Samsung S8+ and then with the dragonfly on those as well as other sources. I've been listening to these for hours now with no fatigue. You really do not always know right away as any transducer with higher harmonic distortion will sound more alive with more detail in A/B comparison but after some time will cause anxiety and irritation since what you thought was more detail is actually information that was never in the recording to begin with, nope it's distortion! 3rd harmonics being the most irritating."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile. I don't know how to appreciate every nuance of a given piece. After listening for a week I can say I have developed an appreciation for what audiophiles talk about. How can you not with these beauties?? After switch through the different ear tips, you'll find one that fits you best. They're comfortable and do an excellent job of isolating you from the environment. Not so much that you can't hear someone trying to talk to one, but once the music turns on you're in another world!

As a drummer (mediocre) these IEMs have saved my ears. I usually play listening to music off of my phone with some cheaper Bose ear phones but after any 10 min session my ears would be ringing. At baseline I have tinnitus, thank you very much Alice In Chains concert in 2007, so these provide me with incredible sound with no further damage to my ears. Honestly, that is priceless. So if you're a drummer like me looking for superb audio and ear protection, these are for you.

A great tip I read is checking out CDs from local libraries and ripping the files to your computer in FLAC or WAV formats, providing you with lossless audio quality, fit for these IEMs. Also, if you have Spotify, google how to use the Spotify Web Player (NOT APP!!!) that is available through Google Chrome only. This provides INCREDIBLE hifi streaming capabilities far superior to that of the Desktop app. You will need to be a premium member, but odds are if you have money for these, you'll have money to support their use.

So just like that, I've been converted into an audiophile, or at least a noob audiophile. I love these!"
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"846 (stock blue/white tubes) vs W60 vs M-Audio IE40 (a tweaked and rebadged UE TripleFi)

I bought a W60. Its faceplate cracked in two days. I sent it back and got an 846. It's a happy accident that the W60 broke. I like the 846 much better. I was lucky enough to try both, so I thought I'd try to compare them. So here's what I thought:

Soundstage:
W60 - OK width. Not very deep. The vocalist sometimes felt too close, sort of vaguely placed. I couldn't quite pin down the instruments in space. It didn't feel like there was a band in the room. But very airy. Good instrument separation.
846 - Wider and deeper. More natural consistent instrument placement, like they were in the room. Excellent instrument separation.

Percussion:
W60 - Cymbals are clear and shimmering and distinct, not harsh. So detailed I swear I could hear the individual thingies in a tambourine, the texture of the skin on the drum. Awesome for piano (which is a percussive instrument, I think?). I never cared for Elton John before, but on these his piano playing sounds awesome, wrenching. Good crisp bass drum.
846 - with stock blue tips: Cymbals are kind of a splat. It's not unpleasant, but in comparison... The high end rolls off so much you don't get the details. Lower pitched percussion - blocks, hand claps - are handled beautifully. Drums aren't bad, but they're better on the W60. Piano isn't riveting.
846 - with white tips: much, much better than blue tips for percussion.

Vocals:
W60 - I wasn't impressed. I thought these were supposed to be good for female voices, but kd lang sounded blah. Not much of an improvement over my triplefi's. Some women sounded great - Shirley Caesar, Patty Loveless - just not as many as I would have expected. Men not as good. Chanticleer doing renaissance a capella was blah.
846 blue tips - Spectacular. Warm, detailed, realistic. Good separation, placement. Great on harmonies. I think Shure tunes for vocals - their warm signature sound.
846 white tips - You sacrifice a little bit of warmth for tons more detail. I strongly prefer it.

Guitar:
W60 - Not much of an improvement over the triplefis.
846 blue tips- Rich, detailed, warm. Noticeable improvement.
846 white tips - Even more detail.

Bass:
W60 - Better detail
846 blue tips - Goes lower, more ummph when needed, murkier
846 white tips - Same, just eq'd down a little bit.

Synths:
W60 - meh
846 blue tips - much better, more alive, good 3D effect
846 white tips - even better. More detail

Brass:
W60 - sax sounded great
846 blue tips - horns sounded great
846 white tips - now sax sounds amazing

Styles of music that I think would work best:
W60 - piano, orchestral, orchestrated pop, jazz
846 - rock (prog rock, neo-psychedelic, country rock...), synths, country, bluegrass (banjo is probably better on the W60s), dance music, gospel

Improvement over my old triplefi's (an old $400 three BA iem)
W60 - I heard new details in surprisingly few songs. Hugely disappointed at how flat Pink Floyd and the Dandy Warhols sounded. So little of my favorite music sounded better I wasn't sure the improvement was worth the $600. (If I preferred piano music, it would be different.)
846 - Lots of new detail across genres. Finally figured out what some lyrics were! (Very clear vocals) So much more detail it was definitely worth the upgrade.

Comfort/build:
W60 - Very small, light, and comfortable. Better for small ears. Will the all-plastic build last over time?
846 - Fits me comfortably, but I'm 6'2"". Sturdy. Metal nozzle. I like it fine.

Edit: I switched to white tips. What a HUGE improvement - for my tastes. Big improvement of instrument detail and separation - which is my favorite thing. A little less bass, a little less warmth, but worth the trade-off... for me."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy with the shure se846 amazing sound
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for over a year now and love them so much I had to post. This is my third pair of high end Shure Earphones in the last few years, one pair of the Shure SE530 the original model but they wore out because cord became frayed and could not be replaced. I replaced them with a pair of Shure SE535 two years ago and then these Shure SE846. The SE535 were shockingly expensive and I still can't believe I spent a ""Grand"" buying them on Amazon, so I had high expectations after all the posted positive reviews. Are they worth twice the price of the already expensive SE530 $500 price? Hard to say, but they are CLEARLY BETTER!!. Now I can't listen to the barely used SE535 because these have ruined my listening expectation. If you have near perfect hearing and can tolerate an in ear headphone, definitely get these."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not a pleasant shopping experience. The earphones sent to me was a Japanese export edition and the included parts are different compared with the US edition. There was no hard plastic case and the whole box is held closed with a small circular scotch tape.

I will be returning this product because it does not match up with the descriptions but I will purchase this earphone some where else"
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing! Like most people, I was a little hesitant to spend so much on a pair of earphones, but finally gave in and just received my SE846-BLU's yesterday evening. The box and included accessories is first-rate, and includes everything you need to get the earphones a proper fit. I tried the earpieces that came installed, but they were a bit too big for my ears, so I tried the ""Tree looking"" ones. Wow, talk about serious noise isolation.

The bass these deliver is nothing short of phenomenal: deep and clear, but not overpowering. I think the highs are a little laid back, but are much less fatiguing than some of the previous headphones I've tried out. The Mid's and Bass are just unbelievable though; much better than any other headphone or earphone I've heard. It literally sounds like the music is coming from inside my head, and reveals details I never even knew existed on many tracks. Truly an audiophile set of phones, and definitely worth the investment if sound isolation and fantastic music is important to you.

PS: My set came in a sealed box, with all accessories included, and is definitely the brand new US version.

Highly recommended!"
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent the past year looking for a pair of earphones that gave me the full spectrum of sound--hi-fi in miniature size. In the process I found myself becoming more picky, scrutinizing each pair as I found one set that was a little better--only to find them deficient in some way. I really didn't want to spend more than $100, either (cue the dubious laughter). But it seemed I would have to splurge for the perfection I sought. But a grand??? No way, I thought (for the SE846). So I went with the SE535, convinced they would be good enough. And they almost were . . .

The trouble is, the bass of the SE535 earphones is not quite as dramatic or deep as I want. And the treble isn't ""quite there"" (to where I personally would like it) either. There was the additional annoyance that the impedance requirement made them unusable with portable devices without an external amp.

And so . . . With a wave a nausea over spending so much on a pair of earphones, I bought the SE846. If only I had done so in the first place! I literally spent as more on all the pairs I acquired in my pursuit for perfection, anyway!

The bass of the SE846 is so much, I actually find myself backing the EQ off a bit on lowest range (before it was set to max with every other pair I owned, save the Bose QC-20, which are partly responsible for me turning my nose up at the bass of the SE535). The treble hits the mark, albeit the EQ is at max on that range (and I understand the custom filters that come with the SE846 will boost the upper range more, but I'm not tinkering with them for now).

Another significance is that I can actually use these with my phone and tablet! No longer, must I be tethered to a desktop or some kind of amplifier to get hi-fi sound.

So my advice for anyone considering the SE535: don't do it! If you're willing to spend $500, it means, you're not going to settle for less than the best. But you are. Better off getting a cheaper pair of earphones, and not feel bad for getting something ""second best."" And no gaudy (IMO) metal box or model number emblazon on the earphones (I have the blacks) to show off to the world--or scream ""steal me."" Finally . . . I found what I was looking for: SE846."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's be realistic, $900 is a ridiculous amount of money for headphones. But think about how much money you may have already spent trying to find the pair that gave the response you were looking for? I've gone through Apple, Beats, Sennheiser and even Shure SE425's. None of which gave the punch I was looking for. Well, maybe the beats, but noise cancelling over the ear headphones create a pressure problem with my ears. I much prefer ear buds or IEM's. And for whatever reason I am high frequency sensitive, I mean I never got checked or anything but I have trouble getting headphones to sound the way I want. That was until I swallowed my pride and coughed up the money for these. Damn. That's all I can say. The sound posts are tunable so I swapped to the ""warm"" filters. And since the posts are removable, they're also metal, so you don't feel like you're going to break them changing the foam ear inserts. Thankfully I was able to return the SE425's to Amazon in exchange for these. I just should have bought them in the first place."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not going to waste a lot of space here. I've had many headphones and earphones over the years, both cheap and expensive. These are the VERY BEST I've ever owned. AMAZING BASS - I mean AMAZING... right out of the box. Don't even need to swap nozzles that come included. If you can swing these, you'll only buy 'em once... no need for anything different, EVER. Heaven."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, these are very expensive. They aren't for everyone. But if you want the best possible sound in an IEM without going custom, this is your baby. The replaceable filters, the large array of tips, and the bevy of other accessories you get with these are just the cherry on top. Don't bother keeping any kind of bass boost on, because where you're going, you won't need it.

I bought these to upgrade from my Shure se215 (I used Steelseries Siberiav2 for gaming) and these are so much better than either one. The only thing I've ever heard that comes close is my friend's professional mixing audio setup with a high-end mixer/amp and a set of KRK V8s. With these, if you listen to CDs, FLAC, or high quality mp3, you can hear vocalists licking their lips and breathing, and so many little details you missed before. It reminds me of the leap going from cassette to CD. If anything they are a bit bass heavy, but not in a sloppy bad way.

If you're reading this, seriously thinking about pulling the trigger on these, and you can afford them... do it. They are amazing. You only live once!"
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a professional musician, working songwriter and recording studio owner for over 20 years. I was reluctant to spend this much money on IEMs because no matter what the reviews have always said, most IEMS just cant match things like Sennheiser HD800s with pristine AD/DA like I have in my racks in my recording studio. Folks that I really admired told me these would change my mind, so, when I had the funds, I took the plunge. I took the plunge mostly based on the enthusiastic endorsement of a well respected friend and audio engineer (thanks Jeff H.) My friend He worked as a mgt consultant with Shure on the ""consumerization"" of these high end monitoring devices. The verdict: Shock & Awe!!! I am astounded!! I am literally stunned.. I plugged these straight into my iphone and listened to a song I mixed and mastered, meaning I know every instruments, EQ, placement, and panning. I couldn't believe what I heard. I heard incomparable fidelity and life in a way that I have never experienced with any IEM. Mind you, this is all WITHOUT pristine DA and power amp like I have in the recording studio...this amazing sound scape came only from these plugged into my iphone! These are the most astonishing IEMS by far that I have ever experienced. These are not just a little better than the 535's at half the price, these are 10X the fidelity of the 535s. I am stunned, amazed and very, very happy with this purchase. I wish I would have bought these sooner. Shure, Great job!!!! These are amazing and worth every penny!"

1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my doubts about these being better overall than my Sennheiser IE800s, but have been pleasantly surprised. The sound is different, no doubt there, but it's subtle and difficult to describe. I won't be getting rid of my IE800s, just using them less based on mood and situation. The listening ""situation"", by the way, is where the Shures shine: unlike the IE800s, the SE846s stay in my ear perfectly, seem to disappear on my head to the point where I forget I'm wearing them, and the cord is longer resulting in better freedom of movement. When I'm in the mood for the Senn-sound, and I'm sitting relatively motionless at my desk, the IE800s are wonderful. For all other times, these are the best choice. Very grateful to own both though, heh."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned Westones and a few Shure SE535s. I currently use Sennheiser HD800 with a tube amp as my Gold Standard. Previous Shures sounded great for vocals but always left something to be wished for - the base, particularly for classical music. Shure SE846 is perfect - clean base highlighting base and tympani with great definition without hammering or clouding the overall sound.

The HD800 Headphones are the go-to device for serious listening. The Shure SE846 is for jogging / moving / on airplane. Having listened to both, I would say they are complementary to each other: HD800 has a great coherent sound with a life-like soundstage. Shure SE846 has a great separation with fast response. I keep finding things I didn't hear before with each set. I would compare the HD800 to a Steinway Concert Grant, and the SE846 to a great Yamaha Jazz Grand. Both are fantastic but with a different color."

9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have listened to many earphones, over the ear ""cans"", including Bose Noise Cancelling, and nothing, I mean nothing compares to this experience in good listening. I was happy with them when I first received them, but then I started to look up the interchangeable sleeves, and was curious as to what were the differences. The ones that come with the earphones are a neutral, yet tremendous sounding sleeve, but then I curiously looked at the black sleeves, which were labelled ""warm"". I took about 20 minutes to figure out the way to change them (took my time, since small parts involved and didn't want to break them, or lose anything). I just put them on with the warm ""black sleeves"", and these bad boys came to life so well, that I had to write my review and not miss the opportunity to describe them to others. I am hearing things on live recordings that I never heard before, including a live ""Croz"" show that I bought when I went to the NYC Winery on 1/31/13, and I hear him talking to the crowd, the crowd responses, and the clicking of the silverware on a plate, it is that crisp and clear! The base came to life, and the highs are high, mids just right, and I am only at half volume on my player.

I am actually playing these on an Astell and Kern AK100, modified by Vinnie of Red Wine Audio when I first bought it. I am amazed at the clarity and again this is on a high bit mp3 album, and when I put this on the original flac file studio album, I got shivers down my spine. Sheer enjoyment, and the old ear canals can't stop thanking me enough! Shane Fontanes leads are crisper than ever.....and Marcus Eatons accoustic riffs sweet as candy, Crosby vocals like he was in the room with me, and the base/Drum bottom of the band incredible. WOW!

I am happy that I bought them, and recognize that they are a small fortune, but if you love good music, good sound, and clarity, with a comfort that I have not experienced before in my ears, then these are the earphones for you. I would do this in a heartbeat now, after hearing them, and looking back is 20/20 vision always. But I read review after review, after review, and none said anything bad about these. Nothing bad....excepting for a once off this (comfort) and a once off that (one side fitting different than the other, and the solution was to put the different size tips on). Again once off, kept me digging and every time I did, I was overjoyed to hear more and more great things about them. Nobody on the downside was right about these phones, nobody.

I don't work for Shure, and actually don't like the earlier earphones from them. I have had two pair, and still keep an older pair as a spare. I have owned Ultimate Ears, Bose (still have the noise cancelling for trips), Koss Portaphones (several pair and like these for the beach over the ear), and many many others. Never did I find anything that I liked that was ""totally satisfactory""! Now I did, and Shure outdid itself with the SE846-CL.

One last thing, I didn't listen to these on an Ipod yet, and doubt they will be different, excepting for the fact that with the Astell & Kern AK100, it is an experience in good listenting!

I spent about 3 weeks trying to get the perfect fit on these, since they are a fairly large earphone, they take up most/all of the space in your ear ""cavum"".

My comfort problem is that the earphone was actually resting on the outer edge of my ear, no matter how much I would adjust it. My right ear had no issues, but it just was not comfortable in my left ear... I would have pain after about 20 minutes.

So...I would definitely recommend buying these and testing them out. If you can get a comfortable fit, you will love them. As for me, my search continues for a earphone that sounds this good...but is more comfortable."

9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off let me say that when i first tried them on it was very cumbersome to get in and to get a good seal. The stock wires that come with the Shures arent very friendly to the average person whos use to the kind of earbuds that come with the istuff or the cheapys you bought just to work out with or anyone just looking to put them in quick and go. You have to baby them around your ear and then use the wire wrangler to make it snug to your head so they dont hang there and feel like they're about to fall out. Thats if you can put them in your ear in the first place and get a good seal. Before i forget to mention, If you have small ears these might not fit or not go in right so make sure you CAN use these otherwise you will have buyers remorse off the bat.
Your probably wondering why i gave these the full 5 stars if Im dissing these off the bat but as the title says dont assume anything until you see it through.
When I finally got them in good and right the sound from these were sublime and blissful.
You'll hear notes and backing vocals you have never heard before or noticed. The bass is there but not rude and fake like the headphones you see every celebrity and athlete wear. I too got suckered in the hype and bought them. They don't need a lot of power so be carefull not to have the volume up too high before you plug them in otherwise you get a rude awakening.
Just to reiterate you must get a good seal and fit otherwise you wont get the full experience of these babys.
These come with a bunch of tips to get started with to see what works the best. Play around with each type of tip before making judgement on these like i almost did. If you have owned westones in the past or like me replacing them after they broke, you'll be able to use the same tips so you'll have more variety to play with if you still have the westone tips that came with them.
One thing though is that getting the tips off the shures are a chore so be carefull when changing the tips. Especially the foamy ones.
These are a big investment to the normal person so if you can really afford them go for it otherwise you can try the other shures which are still not cheap but compared to these they're doable."

One of my favorite song, Lizard by Mauro Picotto, the bass punch is non-existent compared to my much cheaper earbuds and sound not better than the earbud that came free with my phone. The earbud is sound flat. The hell is going on? I got all kind of mix feeling but mostly bad as I'm really looking forward to own this earbud. I didn't know I could get a replacement instead of a refund with Amazon as I just learned about it earlier. I just return to UPS and once I get a refund and clear my credit card, I will give it another shot. One other thing, I couldn't change the sleeve that came originally with this earbud. My friend and I tried to change but couldn't. The sleeve just stuck very tight and we couldn't get it out. We don't want to twist and turn too hard that could damage the product but we tried and couldn't change the sleeve. Anyone had this problem, please give me advise on how to do it better next time so I could get a better experience with this earbud in near future.

Months ago arrived Bose (about $300) noise canceling earbuds, that are easy to carry around, and that are great for planes. But something was lacking in that I found myself not listening to music at the coffee shop, which had been a strong, regular practice with Bose over the ear noise canceling phones. For me these Shure buds maintain losing the bulk and weight of over the ear phones; and, if memory serves also add a deeper delight in the music, so back to the smiling."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best earphones I ever bought
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My write up will be split into 2 parts, the first part is meant to give you my high level sincere impression about the SE846 (I will not go into the details, since some other reviews in here are very informative), and, the second part is aimed to give you my personal opinion in terms of the product value for money for generic groups of buyers.

1) This is the message I sent to Shure through their Facebook account:

""First of all, I sincerely thank you and thank your engineers for the Shure SE846 creation... They are a real joy to listen to!!!

Well, a couple of days ago, my colleague brought it to me from the U.S., I am not joking when I am telling you that, when I first listened a couple of my reference tracks; I was smiling with joy (don't recall I ever had such reaction with my other IEMs) while walking... (someone probably thought I was crazy...:-P).

Nevertheless, my pet peeve of this pair of IEM, are the stock cables. I am sure Shure have its reasons for including such cables, but I do not find them too comfortable (rigid). I am wondering whether you can recommend any aftermarket/upgrade cables that goes well with the SE846 sound signature.""

2) The following is my take in giving you my sincere suggestions to those people who are interested in the SE846. After all, they are a pair of expensive Universal In Ear Monitor (UIEM), the perceived value for money for these is really important.

- Non-audio enthusiast with little disposable income - suggest to look elsewhere, these are not worth your hard earned money (to me it's like buying a really expensive bottle of wine, but unfortunately I don't know how to appreciate the taste of it)

- Non-audio enthusiast with moderate disposable income - suggest you to save some more money and start with some cheaper UIEMs (maybe Shure SE535 or Westone 4R) before venturing into high-end UIEMs

- Non-audio enthusiast with a high disposable income - suggest to buy them, even if you might not appreciate them, as much as, the audio enthusiasts. After all, the SE846 is one of the best UIEMs in the market now, and, you can replace the 3 included sets of nozzles to slightly adjust the sound (it is like having 3 slightly different sounds in 1 IEM, every time you replace the nozzles).

- Audio enthusiasts - if you can afford them, they are worth the money. From the first time you slowly unbox the SE846 to the time you check all the included accessories, it oozes quality and luxury (and it is not the best part yet).

The best part is when you start listening to them, going through those reference tracks you always listen to with your other UIEMs (knowing there were some shortcomings or wishing something a little bit more/less, in certain parts of the songs); and finding out that the SE846 can handle your expectations (with the 3 replaceable bright/balanced/warm nozzles).

I hope the above will be helpful to potential buyers. Apologies for the long review, I got carried away :-).

Cheers"

1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these with my in-ears monitoring system (also a Shure product) as an upgrade from the SE215 earbuds that came with it. As one would expect upgrading from two to four drivers, the sound quality is drastically improved. I do not need to have the volume up as high in general, but hearing the other vocals above my own voice is considerably clearer, making harmonies much easier as well as singing lead. Instruments are much less muddy sounding, and adding bass to my monitor mix is now possible!"
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I gave it a four-star rate, these 1000 dollar earphones won't beat your 300 dollar DT990. Keep that in mind.
So then why would I buy them? Well, I personally like listening to pop, rock, these everyday kind of stuff. I don't often listen to test tracks just to test the performance of my headphones/earphones, neither do I listen to classics( guess that's why I'm not a decent Hi-Fier XD). Also I was looking for a pair of earphones I can wear while walking, easy to carry with. I don't want to carry my big headphones dragging those long cords. So what's left for me were earphones. I was looking at K3003, SE846, UE900, IE800,and a pair of aurisonics. I did some research. Looking at others' review may not be the best way to choose your headphones but at least they give you some ideas. According to most reviews, SE846 dedicated to pop music the most. So I chose these. And they do. A lot of high qualified bass, rocks when you listen to rocks. Compared to headphones, mid and high sound a little... not as clear, but still, very good for pop and vocal. Quick response. Those ear tips isolate noise very well. And it was fun playing those different sound filters BTW. Differences are obvious. My advise: If you want ultimate sound experience, go with big headphones; wanna carry it along? Then maybe K3003 and IE800 are more balanced, but these ones are the best for plugging into your phone and listen to billboard. Don't want to spend so much? I personally tried UE900, similar sound character, but cost you much less without too much lost sound quality."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the price, while quality/price ratio is respectively not high. That is to say, when you spent $500 on an IEM, you get 80% of what you want; when you pay $1000, you get 90%. Definitely not recommended if you think could blow you away."

5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are AMAZING! I just had to write a review, something I have never done before on amazon, even with over 1000 purchases over the years. I have owned the 530 and 535 since it came out, and I was really hesitant about buying the 846s, especially given the HUGE price jump, more than double the price of their previous flagships! Honestly, I bought it from amazon thinking I will probably return it after doing a brief trial, but I can confidently say that these are definitely worth the money.

Compared to the 535s, there is a definitely noticeable improvement in sound. Sorry for lack of terms - the sound is a lot more ""smooth"", I guess what people refer to the mid range. It is a definite improvement over the 535s (which were already really good compared to a lot of high-end comparable earphones). A really noticeable change is the bass. Used to be really weak in the 530s and 535s. There is a lot more bass with the 846s, I would say the perfect amount..The ""sound stage"" (or so from what I've seen other people mention) is improved a lot more.

I don't really know any of the audiophile terms, I apologize again, but these are are a huge jump from the 535s. I was disappointed going from the 530s to the 535s since the improvement is so minor, the biggest probably shure finally getting rid of its old cable that break so easisly....If you love the 530/535s, you will love these earphones!"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass, but the mids and highs are muted and overpowered by the bass; leaving a lot to be be desired in this price range. Compared to my Shure SE535, the bass and mid bass are much stronger and the best I have heard for in the ear earphones. I however prefer the accurate and articulate mid range and treble from the the less expensive SE535 and the Etymotic ER4P models (and over the ear Sony MDR-7506). Vocals via the SE846 are darker and lack necessary timbre and refinement that I am used to hearing both in headphones and from my very accurate Ayon Spirit III tube amplifier with Legacy Victoria LE speakers. After extensive listening and switching back and forth comparing...it was an easy decision for me to return these for a refund. I was also surprised they are made in China which I did not expect. At this price point it would be nice if Shure would make these state side and it would certainly better justify the price and provide more pride of ownership."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several different Shure IEMs over the years. I'm not a musician or an audiophile, but I like music and I like the way Shure makes it sound. If you can afford it and are willing to spend the money, you will be pleased with these."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best IEM on the market period. I tried the Sennheiser IE800, and Westone W60. Neither comes close in musical reproduction and bass. Their biggest downside is the fit, they are bulky and while when you put them first they feel super comfortable, on extended listening period 1.5-2 hours plus hours your ears are literally in pain. If they fit you. you will never buy another IEM for a very long time! They are amazing to listen to."

2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kinda the best in universal fit BA earphones less than 1000, but way to much bass than I expected. Losing some original ""SHURE features""."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"All of the positive stuff the other reviews are saying about these IEMs is right on. Flat out best I've ever heard by far.
The bass extension and punch are fantastic. Highs and upper mids are a big improvement over stock 535s.
They are a real pleasure to listen to (stock unamped AK120 as source).
Packaging screams ""high end"" and the easy to swap filters is a great feature.

But....
So far I've had two defective pairs, from production batches a month apart. Same defect: an intermittent buzz in the right earphone. I was able to reproduce it by feeding a 250Hz tone while at the same time looping a ReBirth kick drum. It seems like there's some sort of interaction within the earphone that's causing resonance. It's not distortion or other problem with the signal. It's a physical problem.

I called Shure after the first one and they said they never heard of this before, even though there's another review here from a head-fi'er with the same exact problem. To be honest, I'm done with them at least for now. The 2nd pair is in a FedEx drop right now and I don't want to try my (bad) luck a third time."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Professional packing job, heavy duty cases. I did try the different filters and settled on the black(smooth) one. Maybe I'm just spoiled with over the ear cans but these do have lots of detail and they sound a little bass shy, soundstage is good. I used them for my hemodialysis sessions but I've also used the Fostex TH-900 and I love the Fostex. I would use the Shure for traveling use. Don't know if it's worth the thousand bucks."

8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rarely does a product receive universal acclaim in the audiophile world. Usually, products that do are so special, so incredibly over-engineered and designed that the price of entry is truly but a dream for the 99.9% of us: D'Agostino Momentum Monoblock amps & preamp ($90,000 for the three), Continuum Audio Labs Caliburn turntable (over $100,000), YG Acoustic Anat II speakers ($110,000 for the pair)...you get the picture. These three products, and a very few more like them, are all unique in that they are without a doubt the best at what they do. They are not perfect (nothing is), but they do such a good job of reproducing sound, of truly making a recording come back to life as music, that they are considered without fault. The Shure SE846 is one such product.

While I do consider myself an audiophile, I am also a realist. I will never be able to afford a system coming close to $100,000, so I became quite a bit of a headphone and earphone fetishist. You see, while audiophile ""reference-systems"" using components similar to the ones mentioned above remain out of reach for many, buying a good set of 'phones, hooking them up to decent amplification and listening to well recorded material will get you 9/10ths of a ""reference-class"" system for a fraction of the price. So, I've amassed quite a collection: various AKG headphones (240 Studios, K551, K701 and K712 Pro) as well as BeyerDynamic's excellent T9 and even Parrot's surprisingly cool Zik. For earphones, I have the B&W C6, Sony's excellent XBA-4 and Shure's E3c and SE535 LTD models. And while it's relatively ""easy"" to make a great sounding set of headphones, earphones present far greater challenges. So, after reading review after review on the stellar SE846, I took the plunge and bought them.

Many earphones (like most headphones) tend to have a certain sound signature, usually described as warm or detailed. But, because there's only so much to tiny drivers/transducers in earphone can do, get the design wrong and that warm earphone becomes muddy, or that detailed earphone becomes harsh and fatiguing. The Shure SE846 gives you everything, more of everything, without ever exhibiting any bad ""behaviors"". Here is the classic ""Shure Sound"": warm, rich and smooth mid-tones, but with added presence at the top end that never overpowers or becomes too ""bright"". Here, cymbals sizzle, bells ring and the sounds decay with delicacy and immediacy, all at once. There's abundant detail, but it never becomes harsh, never presents itself as analytical. You just hear the recording, hear the music, as it was meant to be heard...as if you were in the recording studio with the artist.

The SE846 biggest breakthrough is the first-ever Low-Pas filter that allows for extended bass that truly can be appreciated. Many products look to go low, but end up with distortion or ""muddying"" the rest of the frequencies. Not here. The SE846's have bass that plays with presence and authority, but never over those beautiful mids or sparkling highs. This is bass that sounds honest and true, not bass that slams for simple effect. Additionally, the soundstage produced by the SE846 is the best I've ever experienced from an earphone. Never has an earphone sounded les ""in my head"" as these. Sounds and notes come from where you expect them to be, with sourcing as direct, or as seamless, as the engineer intended. Indeed, this is what strikes me as the most compelling thing about the SE846: everything sounds as it should, nothing seems misplaced or pronounced. The overall sound presentation is just so astonishingly correct.

This being Shure's flagship earphone, you expect build quality and fit-and-finish to be tops and they are. While some may lament the use of (a very high-quality) polycarbonate body, this allows Shure to show off the inner details of the SE846. Every metallic surface inside is satin brushed, with laser-etched logos. The 10 individual layers of metal, laser welded together, that makes up the Low-Pass filter can also easily be seen. As well as all the circuitry, hand wired and soldered. Shure throws in a very complete fit kit, the unique frequency response filters, two Kevlar-reinforced cables, cleaning cloth, airline and in-line attenuation adapters, 2 separate carrying cases...you get it all, really.

All-in, is the Shure SE846 worth $1000.00? For most, probably not. But, when taken in the context of being able to have something that is universally acclaimed as being the best, of performing without fault, it could be looked at as a bargain. Because, if you wanted to get similar performance out of a speaker system, you would need to spend tens of thousands of dollars. And even then, would you be satisfied knowing that somewhere out there, something is better? With the Shure SE846, that ""something better"" hasn't come around...yet."

3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just your average guy that likes the best. I've had a pair of 535's for a few years and now I just purchased this pair of 846's. I can't add to the previous posts but I agree completely. The sounds is fantastic and I'm glad I spent 1K which at the time seemed a little nuts. Thanks Shure, it's a great experience and I spend 100 plus hours in an airplane seat every month, so the more I can relax and disassociate myself, the better."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned and used Shure IEMs for years. I have been waiting to replace my E5c model for many years. I have been keeping an eye on the newest releases and these looked like they would fit the bill perfectly. However, after spending $1000 one would expect something phenomenal. Sadly I was disappointed.

1. Because they have 4 instead of 2 drivers I was expecting cleaner richer audio. I will say that there is a only slight difference in audio quality. They do appear a tad louder but when replacing the nozzle with blue to black, they replicate the audio of my E5s almost identically. Maybe this is ""the law of diminishing returns.""

2. Fit is an issue. Again because they have 4 drivers they are slightly larger and may not fit your ear as well as the 2 driver models. I found them to be uncomfortable after an hour or so. I wear my E5s all day long without issue. I expected spending this much money for these to fit better. I ordered custom molds for the 846 and with the molds the 846 wouldn't fit in my ear. I wish I hadn't ordered the molds for these as now I'm out of pocket for those w/o no use for them. They do not fit any other earphones I own.

3. There is a clicking noise on certain bass tones. It is intermittent but also very annoying. For this much money I expect much better product. I read other reviews before purchase and found this comment, but apparently this issue of clicking is still occurring. I also was hearing occasional interference. For lack of a better description, it sounded like the dead air of an old cassette tape between songs. I believe there was a shielding issue. I contacted Shure Customer Service. Their CS certainly isn't what it used to be. The first person I spoke with was helpful and transferred me to one of their audio engineers. (or at least that was his supposed title) I explained my concerns about the clicking and noise issue. The technician/engineer was rather abrupt and in my opinion rude. He said my E5s were old and that he had no clue how the audio signature would compare, and informed me that all of the 846s are tested before they leave the facility and are guaranteed to work. Well that certainly isn't the case. He informed me I would have to RMA them. I was not about to do this with a brand new product and ultimately end up with a refurbished replacement. Maybe if they were cheap IEMs...but these most certainly were not.

Thankfully I purchased these through Amazon and was able to return them. If you make the decision to spend this much money to replace/upgrade your old Shure IEMs....Test them out thoroughly! Their quality control isn't up to snuff and their support (at least the person I spoke with) was disappointing.

I'll think twice and maybe 3 times before I purchase another Shure product again."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading on Amazon and watching Youtube reviews on these IEM's for about 18 months. I've had IEM's from Klipsch, Denon, Sony, Beats, etc. I got a good deal on a pair of Shure SE215's and they've served me very well for the past year or so. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I love music and I want to hear all of the details from the artists I enjoy.

I had very very high expectations for the 846's coming off of 215's based on the numerous reviews. I'll be honest, I was kinda underwhelmed after the first 20 minute listening session. I plugged them into my iPod classic and listened to various tracks at unknown bitrates. I used the cone sleeves and the neutral filters. But, the more I listened, the better the 846's performed. Once I had time over the weekend to sit in a quiet room, try ALL of the included sleeves and switched from neutral to bright filters, these things really started to live up to the price tag and I started to notice notes and instruments in the sound stage I haven't heard before. Finding the correct fit and seal with the various earbuds is a critical step.

The biggest and most critical adjustment was the source itself. I downloaded various FLAC and Lossless albums and loaded them on my old iPhone 4s. WOW, WOW, WOW. Now, I feel like these 846's are living up to the audio hype praised by so many others. I won't go into trying to articulate what the sounds are and how good they are. Just know that these are absolutely next level. Shure says these have subwoofers and they do. Don't make the mistake of thinking these are boomy, bass-head Beats type earphones. The bass is tight, accurate, and truly integrated into the soundstage. I invite you to listen to Marcus Miller lossless files. You can ""feel"" the bass plucks because of the accuracy. Given that these are $1,000 IEM's, I'll use my still very good 215's for workouts and motorcycle rides and the 846's for listening sessions on long flights and at home when headphones are required. If you want to be immersed in your music at anytime and anywhere, give these SE846's a try. I'm pretty satisfied with this investment."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had many expensive earphones in the past but they are really the best one till date. Even at this price,they are worth every penny."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from SE215 to SE846. The first impression I got was bass was less pronounced and the lower frequency was muddied (very muddied). It felt as a step down to both of my SE215 and Bose QC20. Added the microphonic was way worse than on my SE215.

Problem 1 Microphonic: The reason why I am deducting a star. The cables provided with se846 are hard plastic instead of rubbery like the ones came with SE215. These convey a lot of noise, even rubbing against the shirt. Replacing the cable with the one from 215 solved the issue. Still for a 1000$ IEM this is serious knock even though you can get alternative cables online.

Problem 2 Muddied lower frequency: being closed, shure IEMs always relied a lot on having a perfect seal. I always shoved my SE215 deep(foam) to get best sound. But in case of these having a perfect air tight seal creates a problem due to its bass. The Bass tends to overwhelm the lower frequencies and the whole song feels like it lacks separation. The muddiness goes away when the seal is barely formed by just placing foam on the ear canals rather than completely shoving it in. Given its size this seems its where it wants to be instead of shoving it in and ends up being far more comfortable. This looses the noise isolation to some extent but I am happy with the clarity.
This could just be my ears.Note* I am not an audiophile I prefer clarity and separation over overwhelming bass."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to loving these headphones the moment I read on how great they are. I was looking for well balanced audio in a very small package. I have no problem spending the money as long as I am 100% happy with them. At this cost, there is no room to settle. Fantastic or nothing. A bit about myself first.

I am a self proclaimed audiophile and listen to music day in and day out. I use an iPhone 6 with an external DAC and by mostly all my music from HDTracks and other places. I have nothing less than 24bit/96Khz audio on my phone. I am very serious about music and one of the weird ones that will only listen to music if it is 16bit/44.1Khz or above Anything less is just ""hearing music"". Oh, and if it makes any difference, I am also a Female... HAHAHA. So on to the review.

Here it is short and sweet. For sound, yes they are very good. I would love to see them have a balanced cable added to it or have it as an option FROM SHURE, but that is the less of the evil. In short, my ears are very sensitive and after about an hour or two of wear the IEM it self becomes very uncomfortable resting on the inside of my ear. I found that I had to adjust these phones over and over again through out the day just to have a bit of relieve. If the cord ever gets caught on something...LOOOK OUT! It will hurt like heck if you pull from it or it pull from you.

As far as the Bass everyone talks about, I did noticed there was more bass than the 535s and others I tried, however... go back and listen to the standard Apple Earpods that came with your iPhone at the get go. I think there is just as much bass there as these is in these headphones....

Over all, the quality, accessories, and dynamic range of the headphones are great. If you have sensitive ears... these may not be the best choice for you.

Just my thoughts..."

3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchase these headset expecting a miracle, but truth be told my ultimate ears tri-10s are better sounding. So I was disappointed but I already paid for them so I will have to live with them for now. Thank goodness there is nothing wrong with my ultimate ears triple-fi 10's."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer over ear headphones (as you will see from my list below) but the 2 units of IEMs I do have are as good any you are going to hear and I use them all the time as there is only a minor noticeable loss in sound stage and detail from my at home over ear ones.

This review is strictly based on my opinion and tastes in sound and music. I am 53 years old and have lost the ability (happens as you get older) to hear certain hi frequencies, that those of you who are a fair bit younger can still hear and enjoy. The point being that I may not be overly affected by what some describe as high frequency screechiness or sibilance ( I prefer clear detailed highs, mids and lows in their natural form to overpowered low detailed highs and muddy thumping bass).

Tested on iPad, with and without Oppo h2 Dac and Chord Mojo also on AV receiver.
Each unit was left to burn in 24/7 for seven days and listened to before and after. The Fostex, Beyerdynamics, Sennheisers and HIFIMAN became smoother, warmer and IMO more enjoyable after the burn in. The other units mentioned did not seem to change radically or become any more enjoyable.

I have had the following headphones and returned them over the last 4 months ( some tested for 2 weeks, others for almost a month with music from techno, rock, pop and all the way to classical and opera (also used a audio reference cd for more comparisons).

Sennheiser 598( good sound but feel like cheap plastic and ear cups are shallow) - Shure 1540 ( smooth sound, wide soundstage fore closed back and very comfortable sent the back when the Fostex arrived) - Beyerdynamics 990 pro 250 Ohm( most comfortable earpads of all and close in sound to the t90) - master & dynamic M40 ( very nice build and sound, but earpads are to narrow and have a high clamping force) - Blue Lola ( sound ok but heavy and awkward) - Audio Technica M50 and Vmoda 100 ( both ok for the price, just not in the same league as the keepers).

Keepers.
Fostex TH900 ( my favourite of all for sound, looks and comfort)
Hifiman 400i ( wide soundstage, great sound and comfort) - Oppo pm3 ( great all-around sound and comfort also can't get them out of my wife's hands) - Beyerdynamic t90(crisp, clear, detailed and comfortable) - Bowers and Wilkins P7 ( awesome build quality, fantastic sound - a little on the smaller side in earpads).

These 2 have very positive reviews across the web and I really can't add anything significant to what has already been said.

IEMs - Westone W40 - great comfort with a ton of tips to choose from. Sound is clear and detailed and they are so comfortable that you forget they are in your ears.

Shure SE846 - a noticeable step above the W40s in build quality and sound.extremely well regarded across the web for these
Sound is detailed, clear and solid. They come with three different types of exchangeable tubes so that you can adjust for bright, neutral or more bassy sound. I wasn't as fond of the ear tips that came with these but end up using the silicon 12mm from the Westones thus solving the comfort issue. After testing, I went back to the neutral tubes and have enjoyed these ever since.

5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something that got 80% of the sound quality of my Fostex TH900 cans in a mobile package. I tried these out because of the phenomenal reviews on Amazon. The bass is great but the mids/highs are muddy. Voices sounded veiled and the sound stage is tiny (somewhat understandable as these are IEMs). I am using a Bryston BDA2/BHA1 combo. They were also not very comfortable. I couldn't imagine wearing these for long periods of time.

At this price point, I would recommend the AKG K3003i. Same price but sound incredible - maybe even better than my Fostex TH900. And they are very comfortable.

If you have reference grade full sized headphones and a quality DAC/AMP, these will disappoint. If you've only heard other IEMs, these will sound phenomenal."

Since 2010 I have enjoyed my previously top-of-the-line Shure SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable - Metallic Bronze, so I was a little reluctant to take the plunge of purchasing this newest model at twice the cost, wondering ""Can it really get any better?"" Well, the Shure SE846 way exceeded my expectations with distinctively enhanced treble and bass, greater soundstage breadth and depth, and notably overall clarity of the individual instruments and voices (I listen to mostly classical music such as Handel arias/duets).

At one website when Googling ""SE846"" I found 3 key comparison criteria between the two earphones that prompted my purchasing:
""1) Notably lower low-frequency: 15 Hz vs. 18 Hz. 3 Hz lower low-frequency. The lowest frequency at which the device produces audio. The lower the low-frequency response, the stronger and juicier the bass.
2) Lots higher high-frequency: 20000 Hz vs. 19000 Hz. 1000 Hz higher high-frequency. The highest frequency at which device produces audio. The higher the high-frequency response, the clearer and crispier the treble.
3) Measurably lower impedance: 9 Ohms vs. 36 Ohms. 27 Ohms lower impedance. Impedance is the device's electrical resistance to the current being pushed through it. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to get higher volume and requires less power.""

My own testing of the Shure SE846 with both my Sony Walkman NWZ-E354 8GB Digital Music Player (Red) and Apple iPad Air ME898LL/A (128GB, Wi-Fi, Black with Space Gray) NEWEST VERSION confirms that all 3 improvements working together have taken my tracks to the next level that is truly breathtaking. I played Titanic: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Anniversary Edition [+Digital Booklet], and the ""subwoofer"" really produced those very deep bass notes of the first track ""Never an Absolution."" Joyce DiDonato, Barbara Cook, Renee Fleming songs became even more alive and thrilling. It was like seeing and listening to Blu-ray discs instead of DVDs of my favorite films for the first time! I couldn't stop listening! 2-year limited warranty from Shure.

Published reviews that you can find by Googling ""SE846"": 1) Gregory Schmidt in the New York Times on Nov. 19, 2013, raved about the ""amazing sound."" He found the cords that wrap around the ears a bit cumbersome. (They are a little thicker than those on the SE535, but once molded, stay set). He also wondered if they were worth the cost. (You have my opinion; you will need to judge for yourself). 2) Tim Gideon reviewed it on Dec. 5, 2013, for PC Magazine; it earned an ""Editor's Choice award"" for ""stellar sound quality."" He provided a detailed comparison with the Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black) that also received an award; while each has its pros and cons, he still preferred the SE846. 3) Geoffrey Morrison in Forbes on Dec. 8, 2013: ""The Shure SE846 is a brilliant sounding headphone. Warm, deep bass, delicate treble, lifelike midrange... they're probably the best-sounding in-ear headphones I've ever heard. Simply a joy to listen to. I wish their fit/cable made them a little easier to live with, but I think a lot of people will be willing to make that sacrifice for the excellent sound. Highly recommended."" 4) Anthony Verducci in Popular Mechanics on Dec. 9, 2013: ""The Shure SE846 deliver a clean, rich soundstage and smooth vocals with the best bass reproduction I've ever heard in an in-ear universal. Everyone should hear music like this--that is, if you have the cash."" 5) It was a 2014 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Award Honoree in the Headphones category (20 honorees). 6) Steve Guttenberg at CNET on Dec. 19, 2013, rated it ""Audiophiliac's In-Ear Headphone of the Year. The SE846 is a universal fit in-ear, but outshines the sound of my favorite custom molded in-ear headphones from JH Audio, Ultimate Ears, Westone, 1964 Ears, and more. The SE846's sound is more open (less stuck inside my head), it's highly transparent, treble detailing and dynamic range capabilities are extraordinary, and then there's the bass. It plumbs deeper and is significantly better defined than the competition's headphones."" 7) Steve Guttenberg made it a Sound & Vision ""Top Pick,"" Jan.10, 2014: ""The Shure SE846 is a brilliant design, one that marries state-of-the-art engineering with a rare musicality. I can't wait to see how the competition reacts to Shure's home run!"" He also preferred it to the Sennheiser IE 800."

0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am curious about the glowing review on the Shure SE846, hence I purchased one when they were available from the Amazon Warehouse with slight discount.

The packaging is impressive, but overdone, but I do like the water tight box. However, don't expect someone to carry this box with the earphones going out, it's too heavy. The carrying case, however, looks like the one from SE535, not commensurate with the elevated price point of SE846. Overall physical fit and finish is good and agreeable to the price.

Now, the fitting itself may be a little difficult. The body of SE846 is quite large, it's larger than SE535 and Logitech UE900. Luckily, it fits snugly in my ear without causing discomfort. However, the cable being very stiff and unyielding keeps falling off. The stiffness of the cable is also prone to transmit vibration, like a stethoscope. While I may not like Monster Cable headphones and earphones, but I think they at least pay attention to use a softer and pliable cable to lessen the cable noise.

The best way to describe SE846 is that it's basically SE535 with a subwoofer added, and with the high frequency 8kHz and above boosted by 6dB or so (by ear, not measurement). With movies it may be OK, but with music, I am having trouble, because the 'subwoofer' in SE846 is completely on it's own, it's obnoxiously obtrusive and stand in the way of music appreciation. While I like more bass, I can't agree to more bass if the 'more' is not synchronize with the rests of the frequencies. While I do not have measurement to confirm what I heard, I found online some measurements and these hard data confirmed what I heard.

I could have kept it because it's a fun earphones to watch movies, but sorry, at your price, everything must be perfect.

I am more than 20 years into as an audio and music enthusiast, I go to a lot of live concerts from Jazz to classical, and I have heard and used many good equipment; this puts some perspective on where I am coming from, to reference my review."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Experience these for yourself. Your ears will thank you.
The fit is perfect. The sound is next level. You put these on, plug them in, close your eyes, listen and you just start smiling....You can't help it. It just sounds that amazing. I upgraded from the SE 535 and wondered about doing so since I had already dropped big bucks on the 535's. Do it! Don't look back. These will blow your mind."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would get 5 stars if not for price. Amazing piece of sound gear. Use it mainly for bike riding. Literally transport home sound system to the pavement. Not safe BTW!

4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this highly revered set of in-ear headphones as a ""backup"" and secondary set to my custom fit Jerry Harvey Audio Layla IEMs. Being that the Layla costs almost three times as much as the SE846, my expectations weren't all that high.

The SE846 is very good - certainly a lot better than some Sony, Bose and Klipsch in-ears I've had in the past that were in the $300 range. I do agree that the SE846 doesn't *need* a separate DAC amp compared to other in-ears I've tried, including the JH Audio Layla. It sounds very good connected direct to my iPhone running the Onkyo HF Player app and high-res audio files (ALAC, FLAC and DSD). For this reason alone I plan to keep the SE846 - mainly for listening while exercising and doing other outdoor activities like hiking.

When compared to the JH Audio Layla, the SE846 exhibits much less soundstage and bass. After having read how big of a bass the SE846 is, I was somewhat disappointed how meek the bass sounded compared to the Layla. So when I use the SE846 I use an EQ preset on the Onkyo HF Player app specifically tuned to boost the low-mids and the bass. Only then does it get somewhat closer to the Layla. I'm not a bass head at all and have the bass circuit set fairly low on the Layla as well so the lack of a strong punchy bass on the SE846 surprised me.

This being said, it's really not fair to compare a $1000 set of in-ears to a custom IEM that starts at $2700. I certainly wouldn't say the JH Audio Layla is almost three times ""better"" than the SE846 but it really is a lot better in terms of soundstage, definition, audio ""density"", clarity, and cohesion across the entire spectrum. The Layla is considered a studio mastering grade reference set of IEMs so it is on a different level altogether.

Overall, I like the SE846 a lot. I normally use the JH Audio Layla with Chord Electronics Mojo DAC/headphone amp but use the SE846 only with the iPhone when I'm on the move and I'm not being too critical about the sound. In that context, with its lightweight and portability, the SE846 really shines. It wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the rave reviews I've read but it's certainly good enough and I've decided it's a keeper."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ear stopped working and I can't even detach the cable to check. At such a high price unbelievably low quality.

Edit1: just received a replacement from Shure. Still unacceptable for such a reputable company and such expensive headphones to make the customer go through all this.

Edit2: broken again 1 month after replacement (same problems). Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had with headphones. Wish I could get a refund"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5/5 in sound quality, perhaps 4/5 in value for money. Major drawbacks are the slightly too warmish treble, which might give a feeling of lack of resolution sometimes. The low end and midrange is excellent, giving a nice punch that emulates full size speakers as much as possible with IEMs. Two other negatives is the stock cable (the guide is very stiff, making setup/insertion quite slow and annoying) and the poor quality of most of the included tips (I'm using the medium olive-shaped ones, which com installed - seem to be the best). I've changed filters to White, which gives a nicer treble and less boomy bass. You can go full afterburner and remove the filters completely, getting even sharper treble, but there's some loss of body in mids and bass, making it sound a bit thin.

In summary:
GOOD:
-Excellent midrange, very nice full vocals
-Good resolution
-Great separation and positioning
-Fairly wide soundstage (height/depth and width).
-Pretty nice bass, both in quantity and quality (tight, no bleed into lower mids)
-The Clear version is pretty neat to look at, showing the 4 BA drivers - this is the safest bet to avoid fakes too.
-Filter swap system actually works and is pretty easy. 3 levels (4 if you consider filterless an option)
-Included hard case and transport case are nice.

BAD:
-Stock cable sucks in usability. Cable itself is fine, but the stiff part around the ears is truly annoying. Slows down the usage and has zero advantages except for stage performers (or if you are very active/moving).
-Could use a bit more energy on the treble. Feels a bit rolled and smooth sometimes.
-Price is still too high for what it offers, despite being a very good sounding IEM.
-Only two of the included tips are any good (olives and foam)"
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a high-end listener who has tried other highly reputable earphones and headphones and I can honestly say these earphones are simply breathtaking. Since I started using these earphones through my Fiio X5 V3 audio player It's like my music has come to life. I'm able to listen to songs I have heard hundreds of times before while experiencing every little nuance in the music I was simply unable to hear with my ath-m50xs. It's like going through life with a wrong pair of glasses and finally getting some prescription lenses and seeing the world for what it truly is for the first time ever. I was honestly apprehensive about making the purchase because of the price but I knew I wanted the best and from all the articles I read and videos I watched, I knew this was it and I can honestly say they are well worth the money. In my honest opinion, I truly believe it's impossible to accurately know whether these earphones are worth it because simply saying they're amazing does not do it justice; they're something you have to experience to truly know the extent of how remarkable they are. I honestly wish I could formulate an accurate combination of words to adequately convey the impact these earphones have had with my listening experience but no words can. No other product has made me feel this way and I highly recommend if you love your music and take audio accuracy and clarity seriously."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its a good pair of earphones with good sound quality but it was a little complicated to put on and to make it comfortable in ears
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Expensive but worth every dollar. I own a pair of JH Audio JHA13s and prefer these over them. The Shure's are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible. Its right up there with the JHA13. Yes there is a lot of bass but its not extreme or muddy at all. You can hear the bass instruments play perfectly. They have character and don't overwhelm mids and highs. You basically hear every single characteristic of the music. I was stunned at what i was hearing and didn't want to stop listening to my music. I dont know how Shure did this but the headphones dont play left and right. It creates a soundpace which is rare for in ear headphones (or on/over ear). Anything from mama-yo to Kings of Leon and Nin Inch Nails sounds amazing better on these.

I have only used them as is out of the box and havent messed around with the custom sound tips (yet).

I used them with my iPhone 6, Mac and on my Cypher Labs Theorem 720 DAC/AMP. The iPhone 6 was really good with music purchased from the iTunes store as well as ALAC files. I also tried Tidal with lossless Flac, which was on par with the ALAC version of the music. Using the headphones with the Theorem did kick it up a few notches. But you dont need special hardware to fall in love with these headphones.

I spent a lot of time researching these and listened to many different in ear headphones. I own really good over ear headphones, including a set of open planar magnetics and closed planars which i use with the Oppo HA-1 amp. If you need something that is mobile without sacrificing sound quality you absolutely wont go wrong if you buy these."

2 more things:

1. Yes they are worth the money
2. If you use them for lets say 5 years and pay 1000$, that's 200/ year or 55 cents a day to enjoy the very best earphones on the market and stop shopping for better (for a while at least)"
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphones can become extremely personal choice and what sounds amazing to one person can sound horrible to another and this is completely acceptable, Some people have a more sensitive hearing for trebles and mids than others which can result in different choices of earphones, some people can find deep bass quite disturbing while others will love it the whole day, so it is important to know what type of listener you are and what type of music you listen to.

I like natural sound, acoustic band alike, instrumental music, jazz, funk music and classic, with little vocals because I like to hear the micro details from the instruments. Usually I like the sound with a slight boost in mid and treble to be able to capture more details but also appreciate a tight and controlled bass, so it looks like this set is custom made to my hearing. (in some songs I found myself lowering the bass just a hair so I can hear more mid and treble details, but this is me just because my hearing is less sensitive to high tones). So make sure you try the different little pipes for sound signature as they make a huge difference, I prefer the white which gives me a crispier and sharp tone

For me this par of earphones are by a great margin the best I have ever tried so far and I am comparing to Angie 2, Campfire, Westones, Sennheiser, Stages and other shures as well but they all fall short

It produces a very balanced signature, clean sound with excellent separation, amazing sound stage and very good isolation so for me the search ends here.

Some models I tried before were difficult to classify as they were quite similar in sound but when I tried this one it was like something else was added to the sound (as usual, sound is very difficult to put in words, and I won't try to create more words than people have already invented to classify sound)

I deleted my previous bad review about this model cause I found out that I have tried a defective set from my local shop.

If you are an audiophile or you are looking for that crystal clear sound and stage sound as if you are a few meters from the live band, hearing every single instrument than you found your earphones.

One only funny thing to note: the provided in-line volume control is of the worst quality you can expect, came falling apart and even worse, it totally destroys the sound quality, it is laughable really, what a shame Shure puts such equipment in the packing."

For my ears, the MH40's are pretty special. The warmth in the tonality is fantastic. But I wouldn't consider them sharp - I like my highs to be piercing when they're supposed to be piercing and I feel like the MH40's drop off quite a bit in the highs. It's okay, because again the warmth that this creates is fantastic too. But when I want to really feel the highs I have to pull a different set.

Until I got the 846's I thought the X10's were fantastic. But now, they sound artificial. Before I got the Shure's I would have said that the base was very present and strong while providing great highs. Love the highs. But again, now after listening to the Shure's I find them to be artificial. I'll keep them though, they're the most comfortable in-ear's I have and they're still quite adequate.

Since I got the MH40's I don't listen to my P5's. I wore them the other day and they are really great, but the MH40's are just too good. I'll probably sell the P5's.

Okay, so the 846's. Wow. I was prepared to be disappointed given the high price - though this was tempered because I was able to get them for half off, but still, I had very high expectations and didn't really expect these to sound like they're worth the $1000 retail. The clarity, and the accuracy of these are just fantastic. As I mentioned above they made my previously favorite X10's sound totally artificial. Listening to Norah Jones felt like she was singing right in front of me. The clarity of the instruments was so cool. You can hear their placement in the room, and the spacial separation. Fantastic. I love music with heavy use of piano (thus Norah Jones), and dang, I just love hearing how these render piano.

The only thing I feel like is missing is a real punch to bass. While bass is very clean, and rendered quite nicely, perhaps it's just that in-ear earphones just can't push enough air to make you feel bass, but it just doesn't have quite the emotive feeling I get from over-the-ear headphones like the MH40's. But again, that could well just be because of the physical limitations of a tiny tiny armature.

Are they worth $1000? That's a really hard call, that's a lot of money. For the $500 I spent on them? Hell ya! I don't think there is anything that comes close under $700."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very interesting product for me. I think it is important to know my audio background before I can start talking about this product. I started listening to music on a pair of first generation Ipod Touch headphones. I then upgraded to a pair of V-moda ear buds which served me well for about a year. I then acquired a pair of Audio Technica ATH-mx 50 studio headphones that I used for studio monitoring, as well as a pair of Bose 2i2 earbuds for exercise. After several years my Bose buds broke due to a cable failure. With no option to replace the cable and an expired warrantee, I was forced to start perusing for a new pair of ear buds. That is when the Shure earphones came to my attention.
I purchased them with the intent to use them for exercise and monitoring live performances and studio recordings. So far they have given me mixed results. First of all the sound isolation is really top notch; almost too much so. I recently used these in the woodshop while running a handheld power sander, I couldn't hear the sander at all and the music was just as amazing. This is good because the music is all you hear no matter what, this is bad because it can be unsafe while exercising, walking, driving or doing anything where you need to hear ambient sounds for safety reasons. This is just something that should be noted before you decide wither or not to purchase.
The sound that these produce is absolutely stellar (as one would expect.) They provide exceptional clarity and all frequencies come through to provide an amazing sound signature. I have found some interesting attributes with some modern tracks that I am used to listening at a high volume. In the past I would turn the volume up rather loud to provide maximum awesomeness and a healthy dose of distortion. With these headphones, you can turn the volume up as high as you want and there will be absolutely NO healthy distortion. All of the sounds are crystal clear at all volumes, which is a good thing but something to get used to.
These earbuds are very comfortable. The over the ear cable provides an extra level of secureness on ones head. If you are not used to in ear headphones you may experience some discomfort in the first few weeks but this discomfort will surely pass. They include two different cable lengths that come in very handy for different applications in the studio and on the go. If you can't find a well fitting set of tips from the selections included, you have bigger problems. Huge variety of tips that provide different acoustical qualities and different feels. These headphones are highly customizable.
Another note: ya' know that hair raising tingling sensation that goes from your head all the way to your toes when you are listening to the best part of one of your favorite songs? Yeah, that happens at least twice as often when I'm listening on these earbuds. It's really weird, I keep thinking there is something wrong with me. But day after day, repeat after repeat I keep achieving the same results. Shure has clearly done something very right here.
Overall there is diffidently a time and place for these headphones. If you've got the cash and you are willing to spend it these are definitively the best of the best; these are the 100% sound. If you are the average consumer looking for a 90% sound for everyday use I would go with the Bose 2i2. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price; sorry I forgot to mention that. This is a perfect product for certain applications, with in an imperfect & elitist price tag.
Hope you found this review helpful, I am happy to answer questions to help you decide if these are for you!"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best IEM's I have ever put on - hands down. Sound isolation is perfect, highs are high - lows are low and the mids are right where they should be. There is 0 microphonics (sound due to movement with the cable). The build quality is incredible and there are a ton of customization options (tips and cones) for you to mix and match.

I picked up the optional iPhone compatible cable (in-line mic) and haven't swapped back to the standard cable.

I replaced the default cones with ones that enhance the high range since I enjoy crisp pronounced highs - but each cone sounded good in its own right. If you have the cash to spare, these will be the last IEM's you own for a long long while.

Expensive - totally. Worth it - yep. Don't mortgage your kids for these, but if you have the cash you won't regret the spend. The travel case is great and the pelican case for rugged storage is perfect.

Couldn't ask for a better pair of IEM's."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best (and more expensive) Earphones in the world: Clear low frequency, very nice medium and fantastic tweeter.
But ... the relation between drivers is not perfect (perhaps the Earphones needs time) and finally, a Grado GR10 is less than 50% the price for a result which is more less as good as the Shure."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply unbelievable. One can safely say about these headphones that you have never heard anything like this. Let me try to give you a sense of this experience. First you will spend about 10 minutes trying to put them on, why is this so f*** complicated! Once they are in, and you turn on your music player, preferably NOT a phone of some kind, it's like someone injected instant karma into your soul. The headphones disappear, you disappear, you are left with an ineffable waffle like quality. There are no headphones. The best lover in the world is gently whispering in your ear. Scrape. Save. Bribe. Cry. Get these headphones.
In my experience it only took about 2-3 hours to break them in a little - that's important."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent bass for an I.E.M., But if you want more bass, a good pair of (over the ear) cans will probably deliver that. But those would of course be bigger, bulkier, and some models sweatier. And cans probably suck battery power faster from portable devices.

Superb airiness/spaciousness rarely if ever heard in other I.E.M.s. So much so that the sound is reminiscent of electrostatic floor standing speakers. You might get this airiness in open back (open back means sound leaks out the outside of the cups, so people around you can hear them somewhat), or electrostatic/ribbon cans.

Very good clarity.

And I like the removable and replaceable cords, and the metal connects (at the earbud-cord connection points) not found on many I.E.M.s Plastic often cracks and breaks, no matter how sturdy it seems initially.

After having had these awhile now, the only reason I took off one star, is because if you don’t remember to occasionally twist tighten the ear buds to the cords, you may lose one or both ear buds, and need to buy more. They self loosen.

Despite that single caveat, these are either the best I.E.M. you can get, or close enough."
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know these are way too much $$. But it was worth every penny. These earphones are stunning. Treble as near to perfection as you can get, and Balanced Armatures that actually give clean, clear, low bass. I have others on the high end, but all I want to use are these."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely stellar. I own 3 pairs of Shure earbuds... the older 200 and 500 series that are ""fixed"" to the cables as well as this pair of SE846. The sound these quad driver buds put out is simply astounding. I no longer travel with my powered, noise cancelling B&O headphones- although I still love them and use them at home all the time. But these Shure units block sound as well as any active noise cancelling item, are small, lightweight and very easy to travel with and feature best in class sound. Yes, extremely prices, but if you use earbuds a lot and have a high quality music player then they are well worth the money for the features and benefits they deliver."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I believe these are way overhyped. They advertise ""a true subwoofer"" and that is partially true. However I did not like the muddiness of the bass and one of the drivers was slightly distorting and buzzing in the lower frequencies at higher volumes. I tested this with several sources including my FiiO E10k Olympus 2 playing FLAC's so I know it's not my source. For $1K, I would expect the IEM's to handle any amount of listenable volume without any distorion. These are currently on their way back to the seller. For the same amount or less you can get B stock CA Andromedas that blow the se846's out of the water."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not as pleased with the fit as I expected. I've owned a number of models over the years - this one has slightly longer ""tubes"" and they don't seat as well as the all the other SE-series. The 535's are amazing enough, and fit excellent."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones have extremely awesome sound quality. The design of the earphones is extremely well made and when you put them in your ear and lay on a pillow they do not cause stress or discomfort to your ear while laying on a pillow. Highly recommend these to anyone who might be thinking about buying them. They have a ton of accessories that come with them too.
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile but do listen to music most of the days. My previous earbuds were the Klipsch S4s. I purchased the Bose earbuds but returned them. The S4s lasted for 2 years and I wanted to upgrade them. I went into it thinking of spending $150 to $200 to replace them. I'm a big fan of Amazon - for better or worse - and saw the Shure 215s. I bought them and were impressed but not blown away. I then bought the 535s and it wasn't a big step over the 215s in my book. But then I hit the button to buy the 846s.... For me to spend this much money on earbuds isn't a problem but I sure wasn't going to waste any money on something that wasn't all that great. I hate to say this... and if you don't want to buy these earbuds don't read any further.... but these 846s CRUSHED the 535s. It wasn't even comparable. I was hoping that the 846s would be just a little better than the 535s as the price difference is ridiculous. But to be honest - these are literally a multiple better than the 535s.... I've had these for a few months and these continue to amaze.

What really sold me on these is that you hear parts of the song that you NEVER heard before. Either instruments / vocals... you will hear things that you have never heard. And some of the words I could never understand came through clearly.

The only negative - it does take awhile to get used to putting them in your ears. They are easy now but it is difficult to do it the first few times. And if you want to share the experience with someone - trying to tell someone else how to put them on is a pain.

Lastly - the one thing you'll have a big issue with is listening to these and walking is way harder than chewing gum and walking. I know that sounds way stupid but what ends up happening is that the noise canceling and the music soundstage surrounding you.... you will walk into things you never walked into before.... it takes away some of your normal senses and your brain is more focused on the music. I've hit my head and toes on things I've walked by a 100 times."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely write reviews but I just had to write a review for these. These are hands down the best purchase I have made in the past year because after months of using them I still am surprised by the breathtaking audio quality and fidelity. When I first put them in my ears they actually brought tears to my eyes as I heard things I had never heard before in songs I had had a thousand times before. Even now after owning these for months, I am still taken aback by how incredible these ear buds truly are. On my opinion, these are worth every penny and I have no complaints what so ever."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from over ear headphones like the LCD2, HE-500, and T1, these are impressive. Bass on Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 1 is amazing. Playing through the Sony WMA1 with high gain output."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not generally one to write reviews, but ... after I unboxed these today I spent hours listening to music on them including some deep subwoofer test tracks and all I can say is that these earbuds are sublime. The experience is completely transportive. I was certain this was a foolish purchase when placed the order, but I now have absolutely no regrets. Simply amazing."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first foray into higher end audio. These sound really great with both my FLAC and MP3 music. Really makes it all sound new again. Most notable is the low-end. Truly outstanding. I did not understand complaints of ""muddy"" bass in headphones until I listened to these.

1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many ""in ear"" earbuds and I have to say that even though these are around $1,000, they are worth ever penny spent on them. By far, these are the best set of earbuds I have yet to purchase. I started my audiophile obsession with a pair of Shure SE215's and was quite impressed with the sound that I got from a pair of earbuds that where around $100.00 when I purchased these years ago. They sounded great when I got them and then years later they held me over until I finally bought these. More on that below. I then decided to try the others as well. I have a pair of SE315's that I ordered from a different site and I noticed more bass, but they seemed to lack the highs and mids of the 215's. The SE425's, in my opinion are the worst ones I have ever owned. Sorry for those out there who like them, I just think they have a pure sound, but they are lacking in the bass department. I don't use these too often. I usually use these to listen to my iPad when watching a YouTube video or a news clip or something when my better half is watching TV. I finally broke down in 2012 and purchased a set of SE535's. These sounded great and lasted for four years. When I was single, 16 years ago now, I always listened to music at night turned down very low. I now sleep with earbuds listening to music and my better half wears a CPAP machine. He started noticing that he could hear the music playing very slightly coming from the earbuds. I looked at them very closely only to discover that they where starting to separate at the seams. I tried to use superglue to repair them, but that only made a mess and they still where not sealed around the housing. I finally threw in the towel and bought a new set of earbuds.

I own several other earbuds as well. I have a pair of Westone W40's that sound very good, they just hurt my ears after wearing them for long periods of time. I don't like the silicone earpieces and the foam isn't much better, they are also a different size if I remember correctly than the Shure foam earpieces. I also have a set of Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series in ear earbuds and they sound really good as well. My only issue with these are that they coil in your inner ear to keep them in place. Nice amount of both bass and highs, but I must have deformed ears as they will not stay in. Also they are a great value for the price now if you can wear them. I decided that in order to get the best out of my Astell & Kern AK100 3ohm edition portable DAC, I was going to have to buy a nice set of earbuds to complement this player. I considered buying a new pair of SE535's, but I decided on buying something different and newer. I first purchased a set of Westone W60's, which cost as much as the Shure SE846's. I started having issues with the right ear piece immediately after receiving them. I thought about how I did not like the fit of the Westones I still own anyway, so I sent them back. I finally decided to buy what I knew was going to be an exceptional set of earbuds and a reliable brand I have enjoyed for years now. The Shure SE846 with built in subwoofer. I did some research on these and read a few comments about them from AVS forums and was sold on another set of Shure in ear headphones.

I have a Astell & Kern AK100II model with the dual Cirrus Logic DAC and a pair of special edition Astell & Kern Angie Special Edition balanced earbuds by JH Audio. This is a really nice sounding setup. I still tend to use my first edition AK100 (the 3 ohm version) more as it has a single Wolfson WM8740 DAC and it sounds so much better to me than the dual Cirrus Logic DAC in my Astell & Kern AK100II Player. It seems to really separate the sound much better than the Cirrus Logic chipset. Don't get me wrong, the newer Astell & Kern is very nice as are the Special edition earbuds. This was a gift from my partner for my birthday. But I still listen to my first edition player using these incredible new Shure SE846's as they sound so great together. I am using the inserts that came from the factory in my new Shure earbuds as they are providing plenty of bass for the type music I listen to. I like Rock, Alternative, and New Wave stuff. I listen to bands like Blur, Suede,and Oasis. I also like the Grateful Dead as well as CSN&Y. So my musical taste is all over the place.

These are by far the best set of headphones I have ever owned yet. The Angie SE from Astell and Kern are very good as well, but not as comfortable as my Shure SE846 earbuds. I can wear these for hours at a time and have. I use the large black foam ear piece as it fits the best and is the most comfortable. These have the same size jacks as the rest of the Shure line of earbuds. I think it's 3.5mm gold plated and angled which I really like. The newer Astell and Kern models use the Trrs smaller tip. The balanced output of the player is an incredible feature and it sounds incredible as well, it stil doesn't sound quite as good as my first edition player. I'm also not a big fan of using my iPhone for music as it dosent have enough storage, you need a separate DAC and amp all which takes a toll on the battery life, and it dosent do High Resolution files. I bought an iPod and wish now I had not as it never gets any usage. iPhones and iPods also don't play Flac files without an app. It still only plays 24bit/44kHz files, so you need a very good external amp to get the full sound of high resolution. I prefer a separate portable DAC for my music listening and a phone for calling people. I have mostly 24bit/192kHz files on my Astell & Kern Player. It will also do other formats including DSD, but I have a nice set up at home for really high resolution music listening. In fact these Shure earbuds seem to have more bass response than my Beyerdynamic Tesla headphones that I use with my home set up. I have also decompressed a few Apple Music files and added them to my portable player as well and they sound much better than playing them through my iPhone, iPad, or my iPod with an Oppo DAC/Amp combo.

This set of headphones has unbelievable bass response as well as highs, mids, and things I was never even able to hear with my SE535 earbuds. I just can't figure out how Shure engineered these earbuds to get this much bass from such a small earpiece. It is a true subwoofer sound and it blows away any set of midrange priced earbuds away. I have always been under the impression that I needed to ""break in"" my earbuds as well, but if you go to Shure's website, they say that there isn't any difference in sound after the first day or after one hundred days on their earbuds. They only recommend ""breaking in"" over the ear headphones. They sounded incredible right out of the impressive packaging. These are top notch and come with a set of different inserts for listening taste. One high range, the preinstalled mid range, and a lower range which neither of the other two I have tried yet. The preinstalled inserts are phenomenal in soundstage and everything I have on my player sounds like it's 10 times better than with my older SE535 earbuds. Them come with an attached 60 inch cable, but you also get a shorter cable (40"") , a set of various tips, the extra inserts with a tool to change them, a square hard shell case, and a cleaning rag. Everything is all packaged in a really nice magnetic closure cardboard box with the instructions in a slot inside the lid and the product is in a water tight plastic case. Similar to a Pelican case. I'm not sure if it's waterproof, but it appears to be. I have already ordered another square case, one for my earbuds and another for my accessories. I would not hesitate to buy these again and would highly recommend these to any audiophile who is looking to replace their earbuds or is looking to buy another set that has an incredible sound stage that is customizable for less than $1,000. My Angie Special Editions also are customizable by turning a set of screws on the cord, but I want be changing these for awhile if they continue to perform as perfectly as they are doing know.

Some user have complained about the comfort of these as opposed to the others in Shure's line up, but I haven't had any comfort issue, in fact these are more comfortable over long periods of time than my SE535s. My only possible regret is that I'm thinking that I should have bought the black or blue model, as clear plastic tends to yellow with age, but if this is their latest flagship in ear headphones, I can't wait to see what in store in the next couple of years. My only other advice is to make sure that the seller you purchase from is an authorized Shure dealer, or your warranty is already no good."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these after seeing rave reviews online and on the tube. I've allowed approx 20 hours 'burn in' time and have listened all genres of music. And I'm asking myself if I missed something (?). Don't take me wrong, they're not bad. But IMHO you can probably get better buds (or cans) for $1k."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfort- The sennheisers stay in my ears pretty well. The shures are a little too big and the cable is really stiff and annoying. +1 for the sennheisers.

Design- The shures look better hands down, they have adequate amounts of weight to them and the replaceable cable is a huge plus compared the senneiser ie800s

Microphonics- The ie800s did encounter microphonics because of the cable and I could not move much in them. On the other hand the shures go around your ear so the shure gets a +1 for this category.

Sound (Bass,Treble,Mids)

Bass- The shure se846 has a ""subwoofer"" bass to it which is extremely unique and can dig EXTREMELY deep, but the detail of the bass is ""alright"", a little definition would be nicer. Compared to the ie800 which also has deep bass. The shures out perform them because of the depth and subwoofer like feeling.

Mids- The shures sound amazing!!!! VOCALS are extremely realistic and sound like the singer/songwriter is talking to you and it's personal. The se846 moves my heart more. The ie800s have excellent mids and vocals sound clean but the se846 is quite effortless and LUSH sounding. Keep in mind that the shures do have coloration to them and aren't reference grade. They do have kind of a fun signature with the bass-mid emphasis.

Treble- The shures for $1000, have a treble roll off which is unacceptable considering the price. They sound veiled and muffled compared the ie800. The ie800 have sparkly treble and can get a little bit too detailed (might lead to listening fatigue). But the ie800 never irritated me, and I think higher end sounded extremely AIRY, and liquidy.
The shures take quite a beating regarding treble.

Filters on the shure se846- I found the Nuetral one to be the best, since the others altered the frequency response, and I generally prefer a balanced sound. The brightness filter was simply ""ok"" It would have been better to see more airy ness on the upper end.

Final Conclusion- Consider the shures if you travel a lot, because of the isolation and can block serious amounts of noise. The sennheiser are good if you aren't sitting still (many people complained about the ie800 becoming stiff due to cable issues, I have not encountered that).

Sound wise- The ie800 have better over all clarity and transparency. The shure se846 sounded veiled and muffled in the treble regions when compared to the ie800. Now if you want just good Vocal and Bass then consider the shures since they outperform the ie800 in those categories. In my opinion I would pick the IE800s overall since they just offer better sound quality and airyness of a reference grade earphone. It was disappointing of the treble roll off which got me the most, if the shures were brighter then they would easily be better than the ie800s.

4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I didn't buy these from Amazon, got them for 700 elsewhere. The moment I put these in my ear and turned on the music I literally cried, heaven in my head."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, coming from the SE425, to the SE535, I decided that I'm in a place where I can comfortably afford these bad boys. I have to say however that when I first got them and played them I was a little disappointed... for the first 15 seconds. The SE425 and SE535 had a sound profile which I felt focused on clarity and midrange, which I enjoy. This makes things like snare drums and vocals really pop, and bass was always somewhat subdued, but it was clear to me that the SE846 took a different angle from the other headphones in this range and really focused on a true subwoofer experience.

As a result the bass is very prominent. It was surprising at first, but once I listened to a few more tracks I realized that the clarity in the other frequencies are still there and the bass is really adds a warmth and a bed for all the other frequencies. It makes you think of bass in a whole different way for in-ears. I personally use the white, or bright, filter with mine and feel like this creates the most even mix of bass, midrange, and treble. The best part about these headphones is the soundstage, they are easy to drive, but the separation of between the layers is very prominent. You hear things in tracks that you never hear before and the nuance with the sound brings you into video content like never before.

It's odd, but even if you watch something on a small iPad screen, you feel more into the video, or movie, or whatever when you can hear the most minute details in the audio. It brings out details like no other headphone. Are they worth $1,000? If you love music and are an audiophile, I would have to say for Shure!"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the SE215 earbuds before these, but I was always curious what a set of earbuds that costed almost TEN TIMES what the SE215s did would sound like.

Well, they do sound better than the SE215s. The differences are hard to pin down honestly, but everything is just a little clearer, a little more lifelike. Do I think they're a full ten times better than the SE215s? No, I don't think so. The SE215s are not bad sounding earbuds by any means, and unfortunately, listening to the SE846s is not the earth-shattering, life-changing experience I hoped they might be. And yes, I know that's a lot to ask from earbuds. But they are $900 earbuds, so, you know, I was hopeful.

Overall they're just very good sounding earbuds, very clear, full bass, everything you could hope for short of a truly transcendent experience. For this reason I can't really give them any less than 5 stars. Are they worth the $900? It really depends on how much money you have to spend, and how important it is for you to have the absolute best sound possible from your earbuds. But I would not say they're a full ten times better than the SE215s. I should mention that thus far I've only listened to them through the audio output of my phone, so take this review for what it's worth.

One thing I will say is that these are EXTREMELY efficient earbuds, meaning that you don't have to turn them up very far for them to be very loud. This is good as far as battery life on mobile devices goes. You won't need to turn up your phone as far as you would with other earbuds to get the same volume. Compared to the SE215s, I would say the SE846s run about one or two notches lower on the volume setting of my phone to produce the same loudness as the SE215s. (This is on a volume scale of zero to fifteen on my phone.) One other thing that's impressive and also a little dangerous is that these earbuds can go to ear-splittingly loud levels. The impressive part is that they still seem to be very clear with very little breakup even at high volumes. The dangerous part is that I would not recommend listening to these with the volume of your device set to max. They get extremely loud, loud enough to muffle your hearing and make your ears ring after a few songs at full volume. But, hey, if you want to blow out your eardrums with crystal clear sound, these will do that too.

Also, I bought the ""international version"" of these, so this might not show up as a verified purchase review, but I do own them."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For several years, my ""go to"" earphones have been the Shure 535...well, unfortunately I lost my last pair on an airplane (you're welcome, whoever is using them today) and I decided to try the 848 as a replacement.

To a degree, the 846 has a lot in common with my old 535's...similar sound qualities - you can tell they come from the same company. The 846 is well ahead sonically, providing a ""thicker"" and faster sound that's much more engaging with the right material. Definitely glad I made the switch.

I would say that a product like the SE846 requires you to have some really good quality source material. Just as it reveals every note in a well-recorded song, so it will also reveal every flaw in low bitrate material coming from a mediocre source.

Still, this is one of the best sound experiences you'll hear for the money...can't go wrong with these."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a year now. They are the best IEMs I have ever had. I've tried the Universals for JH Audio and they didn't sound as good as these Shure SE846s. The bass response of the Shures are phenomenal. It's a full sound with presence and clarity. I don't know all the technicals, but I do know what I hear.

The best thing about these earphones is SHURE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are simply the best -- bar none. Every time I have dealt with them, their response has always been over and beyond what I would expect from a electronic consumer company. PHENOMENAL.

This is the best purchase I've made for my music."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first earbuds/earphones I have ever purchased at any price that have real and deep bass. Simply unbelievable. Who needs big over the ear headphones if you have these? These put my Shure SE535s to shame -- they sound like garbage next to these SE846.

Besides the deep and real bass these earphones have a fantastic separation of sounds. All these separate drivers help to create a real soundstage.

These earphones give meaning the the adage that you get what you pay for.

The only thing that is not perfect is the cables do not feel quite as sturdy as those on my Shure SE535s. But all told what fantastic sound these have."

First of all I must say THANK YOU for Amazon ,to deliver this item to me less than 40 hours even I select normal shipping.
BACKROUND:
I have upgrade my earbuds from BOSS(SoundTrue® Ultra In-Ear ) - SONY XBA-H3- SHURE SE846
Before I buy this,SE846 ,I did too much research on internet and finally decide to buy it. While I research on internet I didn’t find any single comparison between this and SONE XBAH3.So if any other guy who has any idea to upgrade from SONY XBAH3 to SE846 , I hope this will help.

Below review fully base on ,
1).Music source: Iphone 6S PLUS 64GB(Equalizer set as”Acoustic”)
2).LOSSLESS Audio songs, directly ripped from genuine Audio CDs
3).I replaced Earphone TIPs to COMPLY P-series (P-100 /Medium size)TIPs. (Actually these are very very comfortable and have great noise isolation. But beware, I saw that very tiny partials of memory forms deposit inner part of that TIP and it has some probability to deposit those small partials deep inside your ears. So as a precautionary step before it attached to earphone , I just use air blower to throw away that very tiny form partials)
REVIEW:
When consider BOSS , this SHURE SE846 has Phenomenal, incomparable sound so I just eliminate BOSS from this review.
Very first time ,first few minutes with SE846 ,honestly I didn’t notice significant different between my previous SONY XBAH3 ,except SE846’s mind blowing supper quality BASS.
However after playing several Songs (POP/ROCK) I realized that, SE846 has GREAT separation(L/R separation for stereo sound).Sony XBAH3 also has this separation but it does not highlight as SE846.So SE846 doing great job in sound separation.
On the other hand when using SE846 ,I can easily identify and NOTICE ,each and every music instrument sound come from song. when using XBAH3 sometimes I didn’t NOTICE some music instruments sound. (Actually XBAH3 deliver that sound in lower intensity (low amplitude) but SE846 deliver same instrument sound very clearly and somewhat high intensity.)
When considering BASS,SE846 has supper quality bass , but it does not affect to higher frequencies. That is the MOST SIGNIFICAT PART OF SE846.
When considering mids, also good. And it delivers good higher frequency as well. (Actually almost same as my previous SONY XBAH3 which has excellent treble.)
ROUNDUP:
After using SE846 , what I realized is, it delivers, exactly same sound which recorded at music source. But on the other hand there are several audio systems which do the same job( for example: yg acoustics anat iii signature, but price range is between $50,000 – $100,000,which is dream for majority of us)
So if you are a guy who wants such a “premium quality” music at 999USD ,it is worth to buy SE846.
But if you want good quality music with budget value, 300USD, SONY XBAH3 do great JOB.

UPDATE 4-FEB-2016:
Last month I bought ibasso Dx80 as a upgrade. But unfortunately sound (quality) from ibasso Dx80 not good as iphone 6s+ .It has huge noticeable hiss (you know SE864 is high sensitivity IEM), also sound signature does not meet my expectation and it does not even close to iphone 6s plus.
Base on expert reviews and chord web site information (plus Rob watt presentations in you tube) I turn in to Chord mojo, currently top level DAC in the market (it more affordable than Hugo).But my mind always remind me can you guaranty Mojo sound quality will better than my existing iphone 6s plus. Then I contact chord customer care (info@chordelectronics.co.uk) and they inform me they already got so many award for mojo and I will impressed with it sound quality, also they guaranty there will not be any hiss.
Finally got my chord mojo. Actually together with my iphone 6s plus, my SE846 sound amazing…really amazing…!!!!.It has too may detail in sound. And even very small sound also highly emphasize. It has smooth more comfortable and noticeable Bass(if you like bass come from iphone 6s plus defiantly you will impressed with bass from Mojo as well) . Mids ,highs and vocals are Cristal clear!!!.LR separation is awesome. Iam really impressed. There is NO ANY KIND OF HISS.
Then I try Mojo with Dx80 and, SE846 sound not better than Mojo with Iphone 6s plus. Also Mojo +Dx80 Bass is less and treble is too high. I mean not well balance.
NOTE: For above comparison I use 16 bit/44.1 Khz FLAC music files. Always use SE846 as IEM.

Summary:
1).Don’t buy dx80 if you have iphone 6s(+).Sound quality from iphone 6s(+) really really good.
2).Sound quality (with SE846):
Iphone 6s (+) with Mojo > iphone 6s(+) > ibasso dx80
3).For me, Mojo+iphone 6s (+) sound far better than mojo+ibasso dx80 (both with SE846)

For your information:
1).I order my Chord mojo from moon audio ([...]) because in amazon USA site price was too high. Also chord electronics confirm to me that Moon Audio is official retailer for Mojo. (Also moon audio deliver this item to worldwide)Don’t order this item from ebay, most probably you will get made in china crap!!
Contact email Chord electronics: info@chordelectronics.co.uk
Contact email Moon Audio: sales@moon-audio.com
2).I use my iphone 6s plus charger together with ANKER USB cable to charge MOJO. There was no any hum or hiss come from device while it charging!!
3).While listing songs, normally you have to put your phone to Airplane mode to avoid RF interference , Otherwise you will hear some kind of hum/buzz sounds time to time and it will provide bad impression to your listening experience.
4) Sometimes I have notice small hiss, when use this device while it charging. So Don’t use this device while it charging.
5).While it using it will get WARM, As per Chord electronics it is normal.( [...]

Hope above information will help to you."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,They sound fantastic! Unfortunately they are uncomfortable and difficult to insert.
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When rating audio components and accessories, it comes down to three factors: what your personal preferences are, what device you're using to play your music, and what kind of music you listen to. Some complain that the SE846s are ""bass heavy"". That may be true if you're only listening to Hip-Hop, but wouldn't be true if you're listening to Jazz and Rock from the late 1950s and '60s when recording engineers weren't thinking about emphasizing bass and were looking for a more neutral sound. So, how do the SE846s perform? Good bass presence (compared to the SE535s) without overwhelming the mids and highs. (The advantage of a solid bass presence is that you can always tone it down if it's too much. It's better to have it in reserve if you really want it; and you can neutralize it if you need to using an equalizer.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, the treble range is bright, but not overly so, especially if you (again) use an equalizer on your home computer or if you use a sophisticated equalizer App like EQu. The mid-range is well represented, with vocals and other ambient sounds and instruments articulated well. In short, the SE846s are much more ""punchy"" than the SE535s, which may get a bit of getting used to. But . . . if you EQ the music properly according to your taste and the genre of music you're listening to, these will certainly do the trick. In my opinion, well worth the money."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I must say this is it for me.

I own a pair of Etymotics ER4P, as well as Ultimate Ears UE11 Pro, and until recently (when I accidently stood on them) a pair of JH13 Pro's.

I've also owned various full sized cans such as HD800, AKG K701 and top Grado's. Along with that, Benchmark DAC1, Sugden Headmaster, and Grace M902.

The best combo I had heard to date was the JH13 Pro's powered by Sony PHA-2 DAc/Amp with uncompressed digital feed from Ipad/Iphone/PC..

When I had my impressions done for the JH13 Pro's several years ago, I also had a hearing test done at the same time, and discovered that after years of nightclub DJ work and shooting high powered rifles without hearing protection, the higher frequencies in my left ear were deficient by roughly 2.5 DB

Enter Shure SE846 with customisable filters. All I did was replace the neutral filter in the left ear with the white high gain filter and viola, hearing problem solved.

At this level, you audiophile's can argue nuances until you are blue in the face. These SE846's blow everything I've ever heard out of the water just out of the Iphone 6.........that's before dedicated amps.

My only complaint with the Shure's is the comfort isnt as good as customs. But until JH Audio can tune individual ears to a person's hearing test results, I will defer my Roxanne order.

The only other expense for me is a Chord Hugo.........subject to audition of course."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every so often one comes across a product which truly deserves writing a review about, so, here’s mine:
After reading so much about these IEM’s, I finally decided to get a pair for myself. I came back home and let them seat for a while in order to let the excitement pass, late in the night , before trying them out, I decided to establish a comparison point previous to the SE846 experience. I listened to “Divano” by Era, first on a set of B&W's C5 IEM’s, later on a pair on P7 headphones from the same brand (both of them great pieces of equipment which I had for some time). Once I established my reference point the time came to listen to the SHURE’s; was I in for a big surprise, the grin in my silly face couldn't begin to describe how good these were, even just out of the box, the experience was simply amazing. Sincerely I couldn't recommend them more if I wanted to. Are they worth the price? Well, let’s just stop here for a moment and consider how much would you have to spend to get comparable sound from speakers which would provide you with a similar experience and there’s your answer. As with most things related with audio, everything is relative. One thing is for sure, the B&W's will be sitting in their boxes for a while from now on.

UPDATE AFTER SIX WEEKS OF USE> Been using them almost every day for the past six weeks, with all types of music, and, with most genres, they will sound amazing, although certain types can turn out to be a bit tiresome in your ears.
I’ve read a review stating that an external amp and DAC where needed to truly experience what the S846 could achieve; IMHO, I would have to say such is not the case, the power needed to drive this IEM’s is so little that listening to with an IPhone at only 65% of the volume will be more than sufficient in most cases *(with other brands I had to turn the volume up to 90% to achieve the same results); which brings me to the point of using a receiver as an AMP/DAC with them; the difference? Barely negligible, although a bit more depth in the sound could be appreciated, it wouldn’t justify the need for carrying around a separate DAC nor an AMP for their use alongside the S846.
With the exception of classical music for which I find the B&W P7's more enjoyable and Metal which I found to be a little harsh with the S846's I would personally recommend them as great all around IEM's well worth the price."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Third pair of these headphones. I hoped the problem would not be present every time. Within one year, one of the ear bud leads will start shorting out. This has happened with three pairs now. It's not a matter of cleaning. Small adjustments will help for the short term. Very much not worth your money. Quality assurance and design issues. I will waste my time or money again with this product.

Update: Within one year, left side is blown. What a waste of money."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About me: Enthusiast who has just become an audiophile with this purchase. Upgraded se535's to se846's (today). Typically listened to Spotify or MP3s (320kbps) on Macbook Pro & iPhone 6S without an external Digital-to-Analog converter (DAC) and/or amp. (Updated to Tidal lossless, getting DAC/amp).

Questions I had------>

- Is there a discernible difference between the two headphones? Without a doubt. The bass. The bass. The bass. Wow. the mids & highs are perfection. You hear songs all over again. And this has been without a DAC/amp & even at 320kbps!

- Build quality? The se846's *feel* so much better constructed. I was always nervous changing the earbuds on the 535's - afraid I'd snap the plastic connector tubes (never did).

- Is it worth it? Dropping $500 on the 535's was justified at the time as ""the last headphones I'd ever buy."" And they could have been... but I was always 13% disappointed in the bass response. It was good...but I had this lingering suspicion that I was missing out (I was).

BOTTOM LINE: If you can afford the se846's, you can have the best of the best, taste the nectar of the gods. If it means your kids don't get school shoes: buy the 535's and a bottle of booze. Drink the booze to blackout, forget you ever heard of the 846 and you'll be quite happy."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 846 are spectacular !! Having owned the Shure SE 535 for the last 2 years, I have grown accustomed to the Shure sound. I loved the Se535’s however I felt they were lacking in the bass area as far as definition is concerned. The Shure SE 846 takes care of this issue and some. I did not think it was possible to get this type of sound from IEMs. Deep precise bass with outstanding Mid and High definition. No ear fatigue even after 5 hours of straight listening of varied genres, Jazz, Rock, Pop and Classical.

At 9 ohms,the iPhone 5s has no problem driving the SE 846. In fact I paired the iPhone 5s with the Apogee One v2 thur the lighting connector and there was a notable clarity in the Bass and high region, however it was not that big of a difference even with Masted for iTunes songs. However when I ran USB from my Mac BookPro thru the Apogee One, that was huge difference . Seems the iPhone 5s has a decent sound chip.

Was the upgrade from the SE 535 to the SE 846 worth the extra $500?. For me yes, especially since I have now heard the SE 846. Fact is I would have been perfectly happy with the SE 535 if I had never listened to the SE 846, but I have and now I can never go back. I use the SE 846 everyday, running, at work, at home. By far the best IEM’s I have ever heard."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been enjoying my new 846 IEM's for about a week now and the minute I put them on I was completely blown away with the quality of the sound and overall experience. Certainly the highest praise is that they are so close to my high end Shure cans that it is almost impossible to tell the difference. I experimented a little to find the right tips but have kept the standard set up as far as the inserts.

Out of box experience was fabulous and consistent with what one would expect first from Shure and especially at that price point. After a few days I got spoiled and the original ""wow"" impact fades a little but then I just had to breakout my Westone W4's just to validate my opinion. Again, unbelievable the difference between the two. I would compare the difference to what the experience is between a standard pair of apple earbuds to the Westone IEMS. Analogous to going from coach to business and now to first class on a transatlantic flight."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I pulled the plug on this $1000 earphones after thinking about it long and hard. My wife drove me crazy for the first one week talking about how ridiculous I am to spend $1000 on a freaking tiny earphones. Now that part is over and I decided to write a review about it. I didn't buy in Amazon, but an authorized dealer in NYC for a substantial discount and no-tax.

I am not an audiophile by any means, but I love to hear good music (not those mileys and biebers by the way). I am an average music lover like many of you who are considering buying these expensive earphones. And obviously SE846 is a mass-market earphone targeted at most people like us and not just audiophiles or musicians alone.

Build:
Shure has done a wonderful job of creating an engineering Marvel, no doubt about it and I am proud that it's an American company (you know that when it comes to high-end headphones, its the Beyerdynamics and Sennheisers of Germany and AKGs of Austria rule, while we have Bose and Beats - not very flattering:-)).
This earphone is an epitome of fine, crafy, smart engineering. An earphone acheiving the performance level of SE846 was almost inconceivable only few years ago. Shure somehow pulled off the magic. The earphone itself is in a Crystal-clear casing which shows off its internal components in all its glory. It is a wonder to look at. Shure says that these earphones are very sturdy and I think it can take a lotta abuse without getting cracked (although you would be hard-pressed to abuse a tiny earphone that costs a grand). It's a tough and solid case for sure and will stand the test of time. The cables are replaceable and the end that connects to the casing rotates freely 360 deg for additional adjustment. Removing and re-attaching the cable is by a lock-snap mechanism and is super easy. SE846 comes with 2 cables (46"" and 64"" long, both 3.5mm gold plated plug). I picked the shorter cable for connecting to my iPod/iPhone. The cable itself is well-built but a bit stiffer by design. There is a transparent jewel case (big) and a semi-soft case for storage of earphones both at home and for travel. I always use the semi-soft case because its compact in size. Comes with enough earplug sizes and adapters (airline). All the accessories look and feel like a million dollars. Shure wants to make sure that the customers realize this is a luxury product billed at $1000. Everything you touch oozes quality. But, does it translate to superior performance for an average audio enthusiasist? Read on for my take :-)

Noise isolation:
As far noise isolation, SE846 blocks out outside noise reasonably well because of their snug in-ear fit. But, you could still hear the external environment you are in ever so slightly. Its not like the active noise cancellation in Bose QCs (by the way, BOSE is one of most overrated/overpriced headphones in the market, save for those Beats audio :-).

Fit:
You have to find the right earplug (SE846 comes with a lot of them anyway, so you will easily find one that suits you). And, u have to insert them the right way (Shure has a video in Youtube on how to fit these the right way). Now, when I dangle the wires in front of me, the fit is good but i have to be careful when I move my head. Because, sudden movements can unseal the plugs a bit, not so bad though. Shure recommends to keep the cable dangling on the back of you if you are doing some activity as they claim that the fit is more snug and the earphones won't unseal as it does with the cable in the front. I tried that but not enough time to observe how well the claim stands.

Long-term comfort:
With Over-ear phones (as good as they are with sound quality), the one complaint I always had was my ears getting warm or sweaty after prolonged (over an hour or sometimes even less) wear. But, the comfort level on SE846 is quite good. I didn't feel like I was bothered with something snugly blocking my ear canal. The design is well thought out when I compare it to my old Ultimate ears in-ear earphones. SE846 is a bit bigger because Shure had to cram all those Quad Hi-Def drivers and other components into such a tiny casing. Its a bit bulbous if you will, but not uncomfortable if you have a medium sized ear like me.

Sound quality:
Now the Sound quality. I have owned some in-ear phones in the past like Ultimate Ears Super Fi 5 Pro and Triple Fi 10. I also have a Audio-Technica M50X Over-ear headphones. And I listen to mostly Pop and rock songs. To check how good SE846 is, I compared hearing the same song (320 kbps) on M50X and SE846 using my iPod and iPhone. I know its not an apple-to-apple comparison, but I just wanted to check how much better a $1000 earphone is compared to a $150 headphone (and in my opinion, Audio Technica M50X is worth every dollar). By the way, you could definitely take the sound quality several notches up on any headphone by using the right Audio source and a Amplifier/DAC. But, I use my headphones plugged right into my iPod or iPhone or Computer without any extra in between (amp/dac). This is my realistic setup in my day-to-day life. Ok, so When I compared the song with M50X and SE846, the difference in overall quality of the sound is not that much. I know you might be surprised/shocked to hear this from me, but please keep in mind that the sound quality can be impacted by a lot of factors including the audio source, amp, quality of audio file, type of song etc., etc., I am just doing a comparison of a realistic scenario (listening straight out of a ipod/iphone) that many of us encounter on our daily life. Also keep in mind that the price of these earphones has a whopping $850 difference. Let me explain a bit more of my experience. The sound stage on M50X was broader than Shure with the highs, mids and lows clear. The lows/bass was good but not great (it's a bit shy of what you would expect). On the Shure, the first big difference I noticed was the bass; man it was pretty damn good!!!! Considering how tiny SE846 is, its mind blowing how good the lows are. I was impressed how they managed to push out so much bass into this tiny earphone. Well, the bass reproduction is Shure's industry-first technology that was achieved by having 10 stainless steel plates precision-welded together creating a 4 inch pathway enabling the low frequency roll off without any distortion (whew, lotta technical right there). The extra bass is not really extra in a sense of warm and unnatural, but in the sense of neutral and near-perfect reproduction with enough thump. Shure calls it as a 'True Subwoofer'. But, as far as the highs and mids, the sound was only marginally better than M50X. Now, thats just for one song I picked. I am sure if I sample more songs, the results may vary, favoring one earphone over the other depending on the type of song.

I listened to couple other instrumentals to see how well the clarity of all instruments sound without one canceling or overwhelming the other tone. Shure shined in that regard. You can hear every instrument with superior clarity. I heard the guitar on 'Dani California' song change subtly through out the song alternating, which I have never heard before. So, i think SE846 can reproduce all the sounds in a composition with much better clarity than M50X. I read from other reviews that SE846 even rivals many other Over-ear stalwarts like Sennheiser HD 800 in that category (clarity in sound across all bandwidth). And for the size of these earphones, that's a pretty impressive feat.

Also, this earphone has high sensitivity (114 dB SPL/mW) and very low impedence of 9 ohm which is perfectly suitable for any portable media players. No amp needed. When I crank the volume on my iPod to half, that's already high enough to hear everything loud and clear. Frequency range is pretty good at 15Hz - 20KHz. It comes with 3 filters to suit the sound signature you like. The filters can be switched within a minute or 2 using a supplied key. You can change the sound signature by selecting a Warm, Balanced or Bright filter. I am comfortable with the Balanced filter that comes factory fitted. But if you need extra bass, switch to the Warm filter and for extra treble, you could switch to the Bright filter.

Cons:
1) Obviously, the price. I don't know if the cost justifies the product. I would price them at $700 for it to be a good value proposition. (I know $700 is still high for a earphone)
2) Since my needs are to hook this thing up my ipod/iphone, my biggest complaint is that Shure did not include a cable with remote and mic. Come on Shure, for a earphone thats costs a thousand dollars, thats the least you could do. I have to shell out $50 to buy one and the reviews for Shure remote/mic is not good at all. I mean, this earphone was not designed in 2005, but 2013. Almost every other earphone in the market that caters to portable devices come with a cable with remote/mic. Its either a over sight (or) considering how smart the engineers are in Shure, this is probably deliberate to make more money by omitting an essential accessory. That's pathetic.

Value:
Ok, lets face it, these are one of the most expensive earphones money can get (i am not talking about those custom-molded ones that the music stars or professionals use, i am talking about an average person like me). I have't tried Sennheiser IE800 or AKG K300I which are direct competitors for SE846. But i have read a ton of reviews on these 3. The general consensus is that Shure SE846 is the best of the 3 in terms of overall sound quality although each one excel in different Sound category. So, if you have the extra cash lying around, go ahead buy this and u won't be disappointed. But if you think u are overstretching your budget, then these are not worth it. Its better to buy SE535 or other earphones in that price range. And, don't forget that the songs have to be in a good format (high quality) for these expensive headphones' to bring out the best. If all we listen is mp3 and stuff, the difference in sound quality between a $400 earphone and this one is very very minimal.

SE846, while they have impressive technology packed inside, for an average music lover the cost-benefit is not that good. I mean, i expected some more from these $1000 earphones, may be my expectations are very high, but hell if I dropped $1000 on an earphone, i think i deserve to atleast have high expectations. If not for the portability of these earphones, my M50X will serve me well especially for the money i spent on them ($150) - again this is a comparison of overall cost-benefit/value. I will do disservice to Shure, if I compare it with a much cheaper Audio Technica M50X, because that will be a apple-to-orange comparison as these headphones belong to completely different categories. The comparison is only to tell the readers how best can a thousand dollar in-ear earphone match up with one of the most popular over-ear headphone (M50X). My 5 Stars is for impressive technology and unbelievable sound for a in-ear form factor. But, I will take a star off for the Value."
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the se535 for just a little over a year before I decided to take the plunge and buy the se846. I know many people will debate whether or not the purchase is worth the money as the se846 are nearly double the cost of the service 535. Luckily I got both at a discounted price from a local retailer in LA for around 100-150 off the Amazon price.

This isn't meant to be a detailed review but I will do the best to post my impression. Having owned the se535 for a year and a half I must say that they are one of the best pairs of earphones I have ever owned. I have been loyal with Shure for the past 6-7 years starting with their scl2 then moving to the se215 then a leap to the se535 and another gentle jump to the se846.

Around one year after I bought the se535 I decided to do the filter modification which requires buying a few audio filters from mouser online, they cost around $25 total for a bunch of different options. If you decide to go this route I recommend buying 2 sets of the lower colors (like white, grey etc). I made the filter modification to improve the bass response of the se535 which as mostpeople know is slightly muted.

Now to the review, the stock se535 vs se846. The bass on the se846 (every review you read mentions this) is miles ahead of the se535 using the blue customizable tips. To me the black were too muddy to be utilized but are aimed at providing more bass. The bass itself is clean punchy and deep on tracks with subbass. I recommend understanding the fit of the headphones and getting a good seal before dismissing the bass as lacking. Each person is different but for me the westone star olives worked well. All the other notes are slightly above the se535 in reproduction as expected. The white filters emphasis how much clearer these are.

Now after making the filter mod to the se535, the playing field levels a bit. The 535 definitely have a deeper base and soundstage after going to the grey filters while not sacrificing the mid and highs. I recommend anyone who has the se535 and wants the se846 to carefully attempt this mod. It may be adequate enough to keep you from splurging on these headphones.

In the end, if you're a first time buyer and $500 doesn't make a huge difference to you. Buy the se846. If you're on a budget and cannot see spending a grand on headphones, buy the se535 and do a filter mod with a good fit. I know there are other alternatives on the planet (westone etc) and I recommend you review those options thoroughly. Over the war headphones will always produce better sound and specialization but these se846 imho are as close as you can get to that same reproduction, sometimes when wearing them you will wonder if you are actually hearing things from outside the earphones (speakers in the room also playing the music??) But in reality you aren't."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me apply a perspective whereas to me these are a great value. I travel weekly, and when I am home have a little time to sit and relax listening to music i enjoy. I have to eek out my enjoyment on the road, walking through airports, in hotels, the fitness center and in the cube at work! I usually carry 2-3 pair headphones, full size travel, like the Ultrasone Palladium Ed 8, then some various smaller ones, Shure, or Bose etc. From the moment i put these on i could tell, i have the Soundstage, liquidity, definition, orchestral balance, nearing my open back HD800, with over $3000..00 of amping and source equipment attached, all coming from a single portable source. I a package no bigger than a deck of cards, I have audio I can enjoy anytime anywhere, + comfortable fit, + isolation (no need for noise canceling,) + durable and sweat resistance, IEMs, and then the engineering achievement, of putting all this, in a tiny package! The bass of these earphones IS the true achievement, it is a visceral achievement and experience. By the way I also play some guitar, and have a feel and ear for music and production as well as reproduction. Don't want to ramble, but I have been listening to high-end audio, since the days of the B&O radial Turntable and Marrantz Amps with Bose speakers; and have bought more headphones across thirteen years of travel; and several more money than these Shure, and nothing touches them. The only experience which i enjoy, which is not better, just different, are my open back Sennheiser HD800 in Balanced mode!
I wish I have never written so many positive headphone reviews across the years, and saved that 5th star, for these!"
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got them a week ago and the sound is amazing, I got the Shure SE535 too and the sound is very different, the Shure SE535 have almost the same sound in classical music but in every else the SE846 are better. You can customize the sound without use an EQ that's perfect when you have a HF balanced player you really doesn't need a digital EQ.

They are very expensive and the sound stage could be better.

Amazing with DSD music (the sound stage is spacious and much better)

Perfect to listening pop, opera, hip hop and orchestral music."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried or owned more or less every $1,000 to $2,500 IEM out there today, Noble K10, the top of Jerry Harvey's line, Sennheisers . . . and these Shures are in that class, and might be the best of the bunch depending on your tastes.

1. They have razor sharp clarity, especially with vocals (mainly, I think, due to Shure's history and their signature mid-treble hump). Much better than some top of the line brands that have a slightly veiled sound. Wearing these, I've come to understand lyrics that I had previously misheard. If you have a hearing test, wear these to pass!

2. They are **actually** neutral, unlike other high-end IEMs that claim to be neutral but in reality have a slightly warm sound signature without enough sparkly treble (but note there are even brighter IEMs out there, such as the AKG 3003 and possibly the Sennheiser IE 800, and of course you might want a warmer headphone. It all depends on your tastes. These with the white filters work for me on the warm to bright spectrum.)

3. They have good bass. If I were to characterize their sound signature, I would say lots of deep (sub 100 hz) bass and lots of mid-treble. The JH Audio Roxannes are better [possibly the best in the world, even better than the K10 and Layla] with drum and tom sounds but the SE846's are good with the electronically generated bass sounds that you hear in music today -- which is synthetically generated by computers, as opposed to being created by banging a drumstick against a surface.

4. They have excellent 3D presentation. With these the sound is sometimes right in your ears, sometimes 6"" away from your ears to the left, right, sometimes inside your head, sometimes above, sometimes below.

5. They do not stick out from your ears unlike other large high-end IEMs, and they are not uncomfortable at all (with my ears and my tips. the comfort issue could be different for you).

6. They isolate as well as foam earplugs (if you use the foam earplug comply tip).

The only caveats are that:

1. You have to get the right tips for your ear canal. I use Comply P-Series medium, which sounds significantly better than other tips, for me. They even sound noticeably better than the Comply P-Series Slim, which is the exact same tip but only a millimeter or two thinner. That should tell you how important it is to get the precisely perfect tip. The tip could make or break this IEM for you. With other tips, I wouldn't like this IEM nearly as much.

2. You need the right source as well to get the best out of it, and make sure it's something with low impedance. But at the same time, this sounds great with just your phone's output jack. I opt for a neutral/slightly warmish sounding source for the SE846. I use the bright filter so a bright dac may be too much. The source will also impact the bass this puts out; for example, with the ESS 9023 dac, you get tons of bass. Update: For the first time, I tried the black filter. It wasn't nearly as warm as I thought it would be, and this might be the true neutral filter; might have to use this going forward!

3. I only listen to pop music, so I can't vouch for these with classical, jazz or other types of music.

4. Finally, please do not judge this or any headphone until you listen it for two hours straight. You need to give yourself time to get used to a new headphone's style.

In summary, unlike full-sized headphones and speakers, inner ear monitors are very sensitive to the tips you use, your ear canal and the player -- but if you can solve these, the SE846 is an outstanding option."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"From the moment you first use the Shure 846's the rich base and full sound will be the number one impression of these.
The kit is painfully expensive, but if you are reading this you probably already figured out that you simply can't get bunch base guitar music from IEM's for less. (In Ear Monitors)

Im puzzled how many people feel these are barely a step up from the 535's Ive been listening to these since the 500's years ago, and the 846 base is far richer, it is possible the 535's mid-range is a smidge more detailed, but overall the stage of full sound picture on the 846's are far better and more satisfying. on the 535's I've always had the low end lifted to get a bit more punch, but they just never could deliver a full contrabass experience, the 846 can, its that simple.

The complete kit comes in a sealed cardboard box that can not be opened without being destroyed, guess at least you know its never been opened by somebody before which can be a good thing. inside the box is a Apple-ish black box with the full kit and the transparent travel case for the full kit. there is a zipper case with the fit-kit, personally I prefer the medium memory foams, but for external sound dampening find that the yellow's are the ticket.

For best full sound, remember to noodle the foams, really thin, then tuck into the ear canal and hold for maybe 4-5 seconds while the foam expand and kinda lock the monitor in place. bam, now you got the full audio experience. only saying this because a lot of folks new to Shure's simply just push the monitors in a little and hang the wire over the ear, thats not enough, you want to get a complete seal for best audio.

Are they worth $999 ??? hard to say, depend what you want from your music, I love acoustic music and want to hear the music without loosing the base strings. But more importantly, noise dampening headphones and in-ear-monitors are part of my everyday life, both for enjoyment and work, so for me, its pennies a day for awesome audio.. hard to beat. if you only listen at home, a pair of over the head cans may be a far better investment, but if you listen while active in-ear-monitors are hard to beat."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably would consider myself an audiophile since I am a musician and avid music listener. Further I have tried most high end iems on the market and seem to fall in love with Shure. I have owned 215, 315, 535 and now the 846. I bought the 535s based on many reviews I had read that put them in the top 3. Unfortunatly I felt the 535 lacked punch and low end. Some may call this true balance, however if felt like too much middle for me. The 846 is a perfect blend of a balanced clear sound with a punchy bass and clear low ends when needed. Basically exactly what the 535s were missing in my opinion. So far I absolutly love them. You will not regret the sound quality, however it does come at a price!"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A stunning piece of audio equipment. Shure - I congratulate you. Expensive, but worth the investment. This earphone is jaw-dropping in every way. I cannot find fault in the sound signature; sonically, it does everything to another level. You'll hear detail, texture and tightness across the frequency range that will astound you. Highs are beautifully airy, mids are forward and superbly detailed and bass is tight and punchy with a superb low filer pass keeping all the low end contained in the right frequency range with no bleeding into the mids.

Tons of accessories, and many options on ear tips which means most people will be able to find the perfect fit for great sound isolation.

Conclusion: for my sound preference - this is audio nirvana (but do audition if possible as audio tastes are very subjective!)"

If you currently own se535 or Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 and feel as if the lows are lacking these are for you! Ive never heard bass reproduction done this well for a iem. 100% worth the price, I find myself using these for working out, snowboarding, dirtbiking and they are constructed well. The cable is okay in terms of being rugged and is the same as the one supplied with 535's. Paired with a iphone 6 and soundcloud 100% of the time."

I was smiling when I've played the song, so clear, normal mids , normal bass, normal treble, exceptional guys, and after reaching the 2min07s part of the song, I was so surprised , I heard so so so so so many instruments I was unable to hear with all my headphones before.

1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first step into ""audiophile"" headphones were the Shure E4C's which I purchased used nearly 7 years ago and they work perfectly still to this day! However I was so curious about upgrading to a better headphone. I was going to go after the Shure SE535, but I never had the money. Then I finally accrued enough money for the SE535. When I was about to pull the trigger on it, the SE846 was announced. I then decided if I was going to upgrade my headphones, then I'd make a big upgrade.

After nearly 7 months I purchased a set of new SE846's from eBay for $800. Honestly these are the best headphones I have ever listened to! I personally use the short cable and the yellow ear-tips because those were the ones I used with my e4c's and they gave me the best seal.

Everything about these headphones are great! The overall look, feel and quality is top-notch. Initially they were extremely cumbersome to get on because the design was so much radically different from my e4c's. I just couldn't do it. It took me literally 40 minutes to achieve a good fit. However after figuring that out, I can now get them in within seconds, so there is a learning curve there. The sound is phenomenal. To my ears these sound better then all of the Grado headphones I have owned (RS1i, GS1000i and PS1000's) mainly because you are completely isolated from the world. The soundstage doesn't compare to those over the ear headphones, however the lows, mids and highs are just as excellent if not better. The ""true subwoofer"" on the SE846 is nice and subtle. It isn't overpowering and it doesn't hit ""deep"" like I thought it would, however there is just the right amount of punch and it is a good tight punch; not muddy at all.

My only con is the warranty. With such a high investment these headphones should carry a 5 year warranty in my opinion. Now, with the proper handling and care I expect these headphones to last 10+ years, however the peace of mind would have been nice. Like I said my E4c's are just over 7 years old and they still operate perfectly so I'm not overly worried.

Anyone willing to drop a grand on headphones I would give these a look...they're excellent and well worth the investment."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried all of the top end ear phones, and these were head and shoulders above. Quality is second to none, sound same. I bought them in Japan at Bic Camera and got duty free pricing which further sweetened the deal. I just pray I never lose them as I'll likely get a heart attack if I do."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I have been a Shure buyer for a long time now. Their products have always been amazing, then I decided it was time to upgrade my earphones. Based on reviews, I decided to buy these. At first, ordered it from Amazon open box provider. But it just didn't sound ok to me ( it wasn't even up to my SE535), so I returned it and ordered brand new from Amazon. To my surprise, the left earplug will just not play. Not sure if this was just my luck, but the quality is just not there, specially considering the price for these. Very disappointed."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets start by saying I am a huge Shure fan. I started out with the E2C's, then moved on to the SE210's, then the SE310's, then the SE420's (Fab), then the SE535's. Whilst I did like the 535's for its bass, after a while I found there was just something missing from them in terms of detail and midrange compared to the SE420's so I sold them and brought a pair of SE425's (Which I personally think are better value for money than the 535's - less bass but more detail and midrange). Then Shure announced the SE846, I was hoping that these solved the bass issue of the SE425 without drowning out the other elements as well as the the detail. Did they fix my gripe? HELL YES! These have just blown me away! They are the most natural sounding headphones/earphones I have ever listened to and to add to it the detail compared to the SE425 is just mind blowing! You get moments where you just smile hearing something never heard before. The bass is controlled and not overbearing in your ear like some earphones I have heard. Everything is perfectly balanced. I have thrown every kind of music I own at them and they never fail to impress. I am only listening to them via an iPhone, I'm scared to play them via a portable headphone amp as I know I will like it but can I justify spending another x hundred dollars? Time will tell :)"
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought SE846 along with Oppo HA-2 and could not believe my ears. Quality of sound I got is close to my 30k music system. I would highly recommend to buy a good doc like Oppo HA-2 if you want to get the best out of these amazing Earphones. Sound is natural, bass is tight and highs are excellent without any hint of harshness. Almost feels like flat response across all frequency range."

Then, I got these 846's and they are SO much better than even the 535's!!! I was describing these to my wife the other day and the only negative thing I can say about them is that they are so clear and precise that they tend to make the subtle ""flaws"" of the music detectable.

These Shure sound amazing!

Holy jumpin. The first song I played on these was a vinyl rip of Boston - More than a feeling.. And my jaw sank. This is the start of a journey and the end of one. I had the Sennheiser IE-800's before these Shure's These Shure's make those Sennheisers sound like beats. Compared, highs were a bit harsh on the Sennheiser sounding near artificial, but not too far off par ( my ear is veryyyy picky) On the shures, they are jsut short of transparent, with a slight lack on the extension. I use the neutral filters, with an oh so slight-slight treble enhancement to get my treble to my taste on the EQ.

Overall I'm just flabbergasted.. they are truly one of a kind. The , the mids as if you're in a front row at a concert. Well maybe 4 rows back. But still, the live soundstage Shure tuned these to gives me chills for ear buds. Well only the first couple times I heard them. Now my ears are expecting the same and better. As will yours. (Disclaimer below)...

Anyway now that you've had fun scrolling around looking for disclaimers (unless you read in order),

The bass on these suckers is so accurate it might just blow your brains. Near absolute zero distortion for the low end. Prepare for some of the most accurate bass you may have ever encountered. And it extends low... Oh man do they mean true subwoofer performance.

The mids are so pleasant and fun to listen to. They almost make you want to sing along,... well if your at some privacy.
They are so fun. That's all I can describe them. Fun and sing alongy.

The highs smash where they should (referring to drums and cymbals), behind the mids, and these buds soundstage is mind-blowing. Yes even drums come from behind the vocal. You can audibly hear that difference. Its amazing. Oh yeah did I mention instrument placement is spectacular????? Mind-blowing.

These MF'ers sing like a heavenly trumpet when you feed them 24 bit audio... my oh my and in that jay river media center program, you can get 32 bit audio support... if you have the proper hardware....

You just gotta get these... they just get better and better the more you listen to them. And you'll find yourself singing along most of the time, and if I bet you won't even realize it and someone will mention to you that you were singing loudly. Idk...

So yeah I just became a fan of Shure from zero to.. Well how ever many days the shipment took I guess.

.....AND
I can't.. come up... with any cons....

IDK if this is the best ear-bud in the world, but someone put this flagship masterpiece next to the FitEar 337. It'll be uber close. CAN IT GET BETTER?!......

Not worth my time, thats how good I declare these Shure's. And I'm taking a rest. These Shure's are my kinda buds.
They are my twins. Baby them like cash. You deserve this investment.

.....If you are reading this far... you probably have been sold, so let me warn you.

OH! And now I have a Fostex HP-P1 DAC/amp and an almost pure silver cable from effect audio, and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm rhodium plated pure silver cable from Artemis.. Silver or go home, its science folks. Huge difference and you can't go back. If you go back I'll call you a traitor.. Because you know it sounds better you just don't want to admit it."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply the best music listening devices I have ever heard/owned! I picked up a pair of these during an over seas trip to Bangkok in December 2014 and pretty much blew my entire holiday budget on them and I have to say it was completely worth it!

In short these are the pros:
+ impressively small form factor
+ unbelievably good sound
+ good build quality
+ replaceable ear buds and connector cables
+ unassuming appearance (Some may consider this a con, but this has saved my pair from being stolen more than once!)
+ sounds amazing even without a high quality DAC

and the cons:
- Takes a few seconds to put on properly
- Expensive?

Ok so now for a bit more detail. First of all I am no audio expert, but I do appreciate good quality sound, or at least have been learning to appreciate it over the past few years. I haven't owned many pairs of high quality headphones, in fact before these SE846s I've only owned a pair of Beats Studios which I consider to have reasonably good sound quality but are horribly over-priced... But other than that I've also tested out the Sennheiser HD800s at CES 2013. So in terms of sound quality I'd definately have to say that the SE846s come out on top, for me the HD800s were surprisingly underwhelming... Though I'm fairly certain it's because what ever Sennheiser was using to drive them at the show wasn't cutting it. The sound was super accurate like the SE846s but it just seemed to lack the punch the SE846s had, at least in the setup that Sennheiser provided. Then if you consider the HD800s $1,500 price tag, the SE846s seem like a bargain considering they work well without an external DAC and have a much much smaller form factor.

The main reason why I love these headphones is because I listen to music when I'm on the go a lot, these are also perfect for the gym. The sound isolation is great, at least with the default foam buds, and they're also very comfortable. They work so well without even playing music that i found myself using them as ear plugs during long flights. Though i think comfort will vary depending on your ears. Even when stowed in the awesome mini-pouch they still fit in my pocket easily and I pretty much carry them around with me at all times, something i couldn't do with my Beats.

Now the second reason why i love these is because of build quality and just the build design in general. A problem i had with my Beats is that the leather and material pieces on the headphones themselves began to wear and get dirty with age. The headphones clearly hadn't been designed to be cleanable or have replaceable parts and that's rendered them pretty worthless now (The included Monster Cables were even more terrible in terms of durability)... This isn't an issue with the SE846s due to the seriously no-frills/practical design. There simply isn't anything on these things that seem like they could wear at all... Even the replaceable cables seem so tough that they will probably never need to be replaced, even if you carried them around without the mini-pouch.

I guess lastly i should mention the sound quality... These simply blew me away, the sound is crystal clear, it literally sounds like i'm sitting in the recording studio listening to the artists perform right in front of me... As a consequence though these can also bring out the worst in your music, any noise or artifacts in your music become blatantly obvious and once you get used to these things, every other headphone is just not good enough anymore...

I don't know if these are the best in-ear headphones you can buy, there may be cheaper ones with similar quality, but i'd be amazed if there's anything that can sound better, at least with current mobile/pc grade DACs"

7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these after much research....and am very happy with build quality and sonic soundscape. Was not an easy purchase...

I recently sold my 1992 BMW 850 car for 1000... While it originally listed for 90k- its recent radical devaluation (based on its remarkable bad quality) helped fund my purchase of these magnificent earbuds cables and provided change for some expensive gold plated hdmi cables. At a whim , I also purchased a set of AudiOHM RNF Army Green Ergonomic Headphones for 19.95. Lifetime guarantee, and they sound nice - but they prob. can't compare to 1k ear buds.

These are great sounding ear buds.... ear buds. My 95.00 Sony studio closed ear phones beat these by far. Subwoofer in an earbud? If you have the money to spend on a less than optimal architecture (earbuds)- go for it."

6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality: 5 stars
Build Quality: 4 stars

I give it 5 stars for sound quality. I have never heard any IEM that sound as good as these. I have tried many from cheap ones to more expensive ones and never could find one that satisfied me. I own many high end over the ear headphones too. I have to say these give even some of my higher end full size headphones a run for there money. However, IEM will never have the sound stage when compared to over the ear open headphones. However, these little IEM has very clear rich full vocals, clean crisp highs (no sibilance), and deep tight controlled bass. The sound is amazing for in ear.

Now the reason I gave only 4 stars for build quality is because the cable it came with. The cable is very stiff which makes it difficult to deal with at times. Even when I put it over my ear; I have a difficult time getting the cable to settle properly due to the stiffness. Also, I have big ear canals and I could not find an ear tip that would form the tightest seal. Additionally, taking off the ear tips was very very difficult to the point I almost ruined the first set of ear tips that came originally on the IEM. I even called Shure to help me. They instructed me to put the IEMs in the freezer for a little bit to see if it helps to take off the ear tips.

Overall, I ended up selling these because in all honesty, I could not justify spending 1000 dollars on a pair of IEMs that are capable of breaking. If these were more durable, like sweat proof and can be used for sports as well then I would have kept these. The only time I would need IEMs are for the gym or if I happen to be out at a coffee shop to do some work. I would never wear these at the gym and I have been through many IEMs. Seems IEMs are more prone to breaking due to its small size and how its handled and used. On the plus side, it looks like every part can be replaced. Therefore, if one of your drivers go bad; I'm sure you could just replace one of the drivers but probably will be costly. I recommend these to people who travel a lot or out doing work in coffee shops or public places a lot. I would not use IEMs for home use. Over the ear headphones will always have an advantage for sound and comfort IMO."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"But decided it deserved this because of price.
seriously, what is going on? My audio files are 320kpbs, but why is there a slight buzzing sound in every song? It is only at certain points of the songs and very subtle but it is there and it bothers me.
It took me over 5 minutes to get them in my ears without falling out. They are very uncomfortable to use.
My monster turbines were way better than these in every aspect.

I would have attributed not liking the sound coming off of these being that i'm not an audiophile connoisseur, but that buzzing and the physical discomfort made these a pain to use.

I am thinking that it ""may"" be a faulty earbud (only one had the buzzing) but i think i'd pass on finding out for sure."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't even think about it... Returned after a week of letting them burn in.. Had a great seal with Compy Foam tips as well.. Save your money and buy Bose soundtrues or soundsports. Earbuds will never conpare to headphones, and neither will ever compare to speakers... This we may simply have to accept... If any of you out there are willing to spend this kind of money on earphones and don't yet have a speaker system.. Your priorities are misguided. Spend just 800$ on a full 5.1 system with a solid receiver and change your life.

In fairness, the bass is as advertised for the 846's... Stellar for IEM's.. Best I've heard. But then again - my 5 year old SONY XB700's (over-ear) that were less than 100$ at the time of purchase have better bass and are generally twice as fun to listen to with a much much better soundstage. Really though... Priorities......

Would only recommend if 1k$ isn't a lot of money to you.

I also own a pair of over the ear headphones from Sony (XB950N1). For me the sound quality for the Sony headphones is so much better. The bass is way better and the mids and highs sound the same. The headphones are much more comfortable, wireless, active noise canceling and the price is about 130$. Do yourself a favour and don't buy these way overpriced headphones.

The 846 shines with good with low frequency basr however the tech behind it is not enough that it feels fast and detail. It's kind of a muddy bass. The mids shines as well but everything else like the micro detail gets covered and muffled. So all in all, you get a good mid and base iem without the rest. No sound stage, no airyness, or detail.

Anyway, I saw these and became intrigued! So many wonderful reviews, and even pictures the buyers posted showing their super product. As I gazed through pictures of the earbuds on 10 year old cell phones on faux wooden tables, I pondered how I could ever afford such fine product. Then I conceived (a thought, silly) that I shall do what these buyers obviously did - I will not buy a new cell phone for the next 5 years and instead purchase this at the end of the 5 years! I'm sure they do not regret keeping their decade-old devices to be able to afford these earbuds. Therefore, not a positive nor a negative review will be left today. Instead, I will update my review in 5 years after I save my money from not getting a new device and will be able to pay 1k for earbuds (hopefully they won't be 2k by then).

Firstly, there's simply no comparison between the 848 and 535. I would say that the sound quality is a full 100% better and I have absolutely no regret in shelling out almost a 100% more for the 848. I have attended various concerts by Roger Waters (Pink Floyd) and I can tell you that at times it's difficult to make out whether you are sitting at home or are at the concert. All that is missing is the feeling of the sound from the speakers at the concert hitting you in the chest and it would be impossible to know the difference.

I've seen before that these earphones had a s/n but I'm not so sure now. They sound amazing and I don't think a counterfeit would sound amazing as well. Please someone confirm this with me. Thanks!!"
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, here is the deal! I own everything from high end custom IEMs to the Shure 535 to the UE 900, and these are the best IEMs I have ever heard, and this is just from listening to them with a rockboxed sandisk. I hate and I mean hate the shure 215-425 but after reading all of the reviews I thought I would try again, and wow. Deep Bass, great soundstage, unreal clarity....I can't say enough good things about theses. I'm not a fan of the clear, as I wish they would have made different color options, but it's the sound that matters right? Flac files sound absolutely ridiculous. I start laughing sometimes because I honestly hear things that I don't even hear on my Sennheiser HD 700... Shure nailed it with these!"
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best IEMs I’ve heard for sound clarity ( these are meant to be played loud ) best low end frequency response down to 15hz. PooPoo any sound filters. Be sure to allow a 2-hour burn-in.
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several pairs of the older SE535's over the years but these sound incredible by comparison.

They're a bit more bulky than the 535 but that's hardly an issue considering the outstanding sound they generate.

I haven't played with the frequency response nozzles yet but I look forward to seeing if I can detect a significant difference.

Outstanding engineering - but you're paying for it."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone sound absolutely fantastic. These phones compare well against my Sennheiser HD800, and are a whole lot more portable. Without a doubt the finest IEM I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. If your are serious about Head Fi These Headphones are one of the best sounding phones money can buy."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are truly amazing........i got them last week and today i switched the little tubes from flat to warm.....blue to black....and the results are really amazing!!! Nice things cost money and these are just splendid.
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED AND EDITED REVIEW ? : BE AWARE THAT I DO NOT WRITE 'FAN-BOY' REVIEWS. I TEND TO BE HYPERCRITICAL. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, READ THIS UPDATED REVIEW:

Since purchasing the 846's in February 2015, I have used them almost on a daily basis. In my opinion, these IEM's sound outstanding across the various genres that I tend listening to: EDM, Adult, Alternative Rock and Singer-Songwriter. They reproduce sounds that were ""not there"" before Using other well-rewpcted p. COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT I OWN OR HAVE OWNED, THE 846's SEEM TO REPRODUCE MUSICAL ELEMENTS THAT WERE NOT APPARENT BEFORE.

AS TIME GOES BY I FIND MYSELF ENJOYING THE 846's MORE AND MORE EACH DAY. MUSIC IS CLEAR AND DYNAMIC. SOUNDSTAGE IS WIDE EXTENDING BEYOND THE HEAD AND INSTRUMENTS AND VOCALS ARE LOCALIZED. BASS HAS IMPACT AND SOUNDS NATURAL EVEN WHEN LISTENING TO 'UNNATURAL' BASS-HEAVY EDM. THE PHONE'S PARTICULARLY SHINE WHEN LISTENING TO ACCOUSTIC MUSIC.

There is [WAS] a caveat (and the [PREVIOUS] reason for a one-star deduction) is that sound isolation is, at best, modest in noisy environments such as the New York Subway and on city streets. One possible explanation is: After trying the various ear-tips included with the phones and having purchased additional ones made by Shure and Comply, I have yet to get a confident and tight fit. In addition, I find inserting the 846's a bit of a hassle. [I HAVE REASSESSED THE ABOVE SITUATION. I AM NOT SURE WHY BUT THE FIT IS NOW PERFECT USING THE TREE-STYLE TIPS. ISOLATION IS NOW AS EXPECTED. IT DID TAKE TIME GETTING USE TO IT BUT INSERTING THE PHONES ARE ALMOST SECOND NATURE NOW! ]

After a couple [FIVE] months listening to music through the 846's and [STILL] working through the guilty feelings I still have for spending so much money {ON EARPHONES] , I can still [MORE THAN EVER] recommend the Shure's very highly. IN FACT, I CAN NOW ""AWARD"" THE SHURE 846's A WELL DESRVED ""FIVE-STAR"" RATING. I WILL SHORTLY PROVIDE READERS WITH A MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE 846's MUSICALITY.

FOR REFERENCE, I USE THE 846's WITH iPHONE 5C, iPAD 2. MUSIC IS SOURCED FROM APPLE MUSIC, iTUNES, SPOTIFY, TIDAL, SIRIUSXM. COMPARED PHONES INCLUDE KLIPSCH 10 i, B & W P3 AND P7, SHURE 4c, AND AKG Y50. HOME REFERENCE SYSTEM INCLUDES CAMBRIDGE AUDIO AZUR 650A AMPLIFIER AND VANDERSTEEN 2ci LOUDSPEAKERS."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound. Yes, they are expensive, but if you really love incredible sounding music, these are the real deal. I have had Shure SE535s, Westone W4s, Klipsch, etc etc. These are the best. The sound is detailed, accurate and full. The sound stage is awesome. I listen to albums and hear details that i've never heard before. I am very very pleased with the Shure SE846!!"
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing IE headphones. They are comparable to some of the best overhear headphones I have heard. Think Audeze, Sennheiser and Hifiman top line units. They are very articulate with wonderful bass and sweet highs ....slightly rolled off. Shure does a wonderful job packaging these. Highly recommended. Over the top with my home Dac and works great with a Dragonfly Red wjhen your on the run. Wow!"
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding. Yes, it is an in-ear headphone that holds its own against a full-size HD650. Worth every penny, especially with a WooAudio WA7. I really did smile when I first heard these; with my old SE535s I was rather disappointed, but these are truly worth the price. The treble is just crisp enough to not be tiring, and the bass is genuine, rich and never obtrusive. If you appreciate music and have the means, then please do yourself a favor and grab these for yourself today! It will be a completely different world."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow. You get what you pay for; save it up if you can't purchase them now.
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay if your looking for a quality I in ear headphone!?...These are definitely those headphones!, the sound clarity and bass are like nothing you've ever heard for an in ear headphone. The price is worth every little bit if you want quality sound. You won't be disappointed."
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been paying close attention to this product since it was first announced back in May. Reviews were scarce at the time of their launch, so i was hesitant to spend that much on universal in ear monitors. However, after the SE846 began having incredible reviews of it's sound quality by reputable reviewers and wanting something more than my IE80s, I closed my eyes and pressed the purchase button. Lets just say that i am VERY happy with the product i received. The bass is incredibly detailed and packs a punch, but I never felt fatigued or overwhelmed by it like my IE80s. The voices sound crystal clear and smooth, it is almost like having them sing right next to you and the instruments...oh man i can hear tiny details i never noticed before. I always thought the IE80s were a good IEM, but after hearing the SE846, I am a Shure believer now :P...also i hear this thing pairs very well with the IPOD touch 5th generation"
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These 'phones beat out the W60, SE535, W40, SE425, and iSine10, only to lose to the Etymotic ER4SR.

The SE846 proved a worthy adversary with impressive sub bass (20-30hz), decent isolation, comfort, and clarity throughout the frequency range. Too much bass, not enough upper mids, a cable that feels like a coat hanger, and the price... no thanks.

The ER4SRs just did it better, and for less.

*A comment on bass. I tried the ER4XR, and enjoyed it for a while, but the more I listened, the more I could hear its accentuated bass. I thought, maybe it's neutral frequency response and low distortion that make for audio nirvana. After testing the ER4SR, the XR's neutral sister, kick drums and basses are now balanced in the mix, and not distracting."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, if you are not ok with spending a $1000 dollars for in-ear headphones, then you should stop reading now. But if you are, and you appreciate amazing sound, then read on...

I have been using these for a month exactly now and I am still blown away when I listen to music I've listened to thousands of times with these headphones. The clarity of each instrument is amazing and I hear new things in the recording every time I listen. Much is made of the bass performance on these and I can attest to the reviews, they are not lying in the least. The bass performs like you are listening to a system with a dedicated subwoofer, but it does not overpower the sound at all. It is nice, tight, clean bass that fits very well into the mix. The soundstage is excellent on these and the sound is rich and full no matter what type of music you are listening to. The sound is excellent, even at lower volumes, and these headphones don't require you to crank the volume up high to listen, and I often find I keep the volume lower than I did with my previous headhphones, which were the Shure SE215k's because these are the top of the line in performance as many other reviewers have stated.

The swappable filters are a great option with this set of phones as well. I prefer the neutral set that comes pre-installed, but the warm and bright filters sound good as well, so there's an option for those with any listening preference. And it really doesn't take much time to swap them, it is practically fool-proof, just read the instructions and you are good to go!

These come with many different accessories, from multiple sets and types of eartips, to various cabling adapters and even a large hard case and cleaning cloth. The one upgrade I can say is that I don't prefer the standard foam tips that come with these, they are slightly uncomfortable after long listening periods. I bought the Comply brand memory foam tips and now I can listen for hours with no problems, so I would recommend getting those instead of using the stock tips if you want memory foam ones.

Shure has found a customer for life in me because of the original set of 215's I have and now these. In fact, I just ordered a pair of the SRH1540's and am looking forward to comparing those with the 846's. I have no doubts I'll continue to be in aural heaven thanks to Shure and their outstanding headphones!"
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is as good as in-ear sound gets. I have owned more different IEMs than the law should allow, and these are in a different class. The bass is everything you have heard abot, but never over-powering."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IE800s are much better than the se846s, I tested, tried both, and the IE800s are the definite, clear winner. The se846s have good bass, vocals and mids but are missing the highs which enable you to hear beautiful sounding cymbals clearly. the IE800s frenquency range is also superior, LOW END 8HZ HIGH END 46,000 HKZ, compared to the se846s 15HZ to 20,000 HKZ, case closed! Please try, test the IE800s before you buy, you will thank me. The IE800s are under $600.00 dollars on Amazon. The price has gone down because the cable is not replaceable at the earbud body, it is only replaceable where you almost always get a short in the wire, at the 3.5 plug in, it is also very rare to have problems with the cable at the earphone body. The other bad rap these amazing earphones get, is its microphonics, which is easily remedied with a clip. The shorter cable is great for keeping it from getting hooked on things, and you can wear them all day long without noticing that you have them in your ears, PLUS THE IE800s take only 3 seconds to put in and one second to take out. There is absolutely no tangling of the kevlar reinforced cable. Also check out the reviews on YOUTUBE. The sound of the se846 sounds great but it is like you are listening under water to get the great bass sound. The ie800s sound airy and breathable with out of this world incredible sound."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely superb I tra war monitors, with superb bass and extended response. Got best results use a balanced cable and a player with balanced headphone output."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited over a year to get it and when I finally got it, I can say it does sound crisp and clear. My only complaint was that it was too large for my ear. Even the small tips wouldn't help it stay in the ear. Also, the wire were too bulky and long for me; it kept moving as I walked. Another complaint I had was it may not sound the way you hope it would without amplifiers. Headphone AMPS cost more than $200, so if your looking to buy the Se846, beware. I wish it had a small microamplifier that attached inside the wires. But it might take years for this technology to come around. Till then, I'll stick with the Se215 which is cheaper and has a better sound stage, IMO.

P.S. Hope the next IEMs Shure developes have triple quad microdrivers with a high def microamplifier; wireless would be awesome too."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,By far the best headphones I have owned to date. These sound amazing as it is when using them paired with your phone but when you use an external DAC using a digital to digital connection the performance is unparalleled. The treble is as clear as can be while the mids are beyond perfect and the lows are deep and rich in bass. Overall I'm blown away by what such a small device can deliver. Shure has surpassed my expectations with these headphones. I truly recommend these to audiophiles or professionals in search for true sound performance from an in ear monitor. The only complain I have is that I didn't own these sooner. Can't wait to see what shure delivers next.
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely superb sound quality. It doesn’t get better than this. Three years (and counting) of ownership, and I’m still continually impressed. There’s
nothing better in this price range."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound if you want in ear headphones with great sound and can afford them indulge yourself with these ear buds.
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, a good earbud, but let down by quality control issues.
Last month, Amazon stopped selling these buds while they sorted through these issues. My manufacturing date was DEC2013, and this must be the bad batch.
My right side earbud has a static/buzzing sound that occurs at medium to low volumes and at the 100-300Hz range. I changed the filter on the one side and the buzz still remained. I also tried 3 other sources and determined that the flaw was definitely in the Earbud.
So, for $1000, this is a poor showing. I gave 3 stars because the quality was 1-star and the performance was 4-stars.
Sound quality:
Most of the reviews here are pretty accurate. Review is with the stock neutral filter (blue)
Highs are slightly subdued but still adequate. The recessed highs produce a nice, non-fatiguing sound that can be listened to for hours. There is a lack of ""shimmer"" to the highs however. Using the white filter makes up for this nicely.
Mids are wonderful. Up-front and intimate. Not effected by bass levels either. Probably the nicest part of this earbud!
The bass is also very nice. Extended and clean as can be. Decent impact puts it above most Balanced armature drivers. This is the first of this type that I have heard that can convey the weight and realism of bass like a dynamic driver model.
isolation-Very good
Comfort- OK, but be warned that these are pretty big and may Pinch on small ears.

But, be wary of the quality issues. Several message boards are seeing a high rate of reported failures of these buds. Seems like the right earbud is always the problem. For $1000, they should be better made!"
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound great as they should but the cables have a really bad smell to them. I scrubbed them with scented soap and it helped a little but they still smell.I really like the sound and would hate to have to return them. Does anyone have any suggestions? Been afraid to try anything else as I don't want to harm the cables.
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best sound all around. After owning the se 315 ,se425, se535. The se315 has nice bass and good sounding mids , ok highs. The se425 lacked melodic sound it was very accurate , almost no bass was emitted to my ear. The se535 is a great triple balanced armature with much better low end than the se425. The y are midcentric which I enjoyed, the highs were slightly rolled off and the bass was pretty good, but not poweful enough for my taste. The portable audio device I use is the ak120 which was compatable with the other iem's mentioned above. At 9ohm's The se846 was not a compatable match for my 3.3 ohm ak120. So I sent the ak120 to red wine audio for the rwak120 mod and now can accurately assess my se846's. Personally any review that starts I use a ipod or iphone I will bypass because that is not hi res music and pointless to test quality on,I do own a iphone and nano 5th gen. But would not waist time listening on them. But it was nice present for my wife so shes happy. So the se846 is clear, clean with a wide sound stage.Bass that is excellent because it in no way muddies the sound. The three other speakers are amazing the mids are much better than all the other shure iems .The highs are crisp and bright but not over done and not annoying in anyway . Just a perfectly balanced iem. Very satisfying on all levels. I only have used the neutral filters though they come with high boost or low boost as well . I never use any eq to hear the way the music was intended to be heard. So great iem's if you can afford them."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it is something different. The scene is beautiful and totally engaging. The audible sub low presence is very natural to me and totally - it's a game changer. BUT... I've ran into an issue with my pair - drivers matching failure. It took time to understand... But still it is obvious! I'm requesting replacement though. Let's give 'em another chance... Cuz the sound is just CRAZY...

Now, while the replacement of SE846 is still in process I want to add a little comparison that I've been personally missing on the web.
I've been doing some side to side comparison of SE846 to my Etymotic ER4S, Grado SR325i and Sennheiser 595. I've used different sources including PreSonus AudioBox 22VSL, Rio Karma, iPod 5th gen and iPhone 5s with uncompressed wav material... My reference records include Amused to Death by Roger Waters, Some female vocals, and different instrumental like Joe Satriani, Jeff Beck, Jon Gomm and the like.

What can I say - the only competitor here that is still light years behind SE846 is Sennheiser 595. The rest of the crew is simply unpleasant for listening to the music.
Sennheiser 595 still lack the punch the speed and bass extension of Shures, and highs are never as clear too. Not mentioning the soundstage! Yes, you've got it right - open cans, Sennheiser 595, still unable to provide that soundstage of SE846 - which was a really BIG surprise to me. When I was trying to describe what I'm missing with the rest of ""competitors"" I didn't manage to find better expression than the sound picture is fading BELOW the virtual midline drown through my two ears. It just seems that someone has stolen the part of the spectrum. That is a drastic difference that make these Shures so incredibly pleasant to listen to. Going even further I've used this resource to just test the productivity of my headphones in different frequencies: audiocheck dot net. It provides a huge set of different test material which will give you the idea of how god your headphones are at producing different frequencies. It was a complete disaster for the whole crew in the low segment of audible spectrum - except for the Shures - they are simply BRILLIANT throughout the spectrum."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not actively looking to replace or upgrade my Shure SE530 custom earphones last year when I heard about the new Shure SE846. I was intrigued enough by Shure's promotional material to start reading the reviews that were written as these earphones started to become available. Of all the reviews that I read, the one that convinced me to take the plunge and spend a shed-load of money was that of Flavio of Earphone Solutions ([...]).

I bought the SE846 in January since when they have become my constant companion. I do not regard myself as an audiophile, but I have always enjoyed a wide range of music genres. It is without exaggeration that I say that these earphones are life enhancing. Music that I have listened to countless times through my custom SE530s takes on a new dimension through these earphones. Even at low volume the separation between the bass, mids and treble enables me to enjoy my music afresh. It is a revelation. When you turn up the volume you FEEL the bass and yet vocals remain clearer than I have ever heard them before.

I have not yet tried the alternative filters and so cannot comment on this aspect.

I am used to looping the cable over my ear with the SE530s and I soon became used to the stiff cable ends which I find useful when using the earphones in the gym. Once in my ears they stay in place with no further attention needed. I find the SE846 to be more comfortable than my customs; they are slightly smaller than the SE530 and I also find that I can go to sleep with them in without the earphones being pressed into my ear canal as I turn my head on the pillow.

I have done one long distance flight so far. I plugged into the in-flight entertainment system at the start of the flight and took them out at the end. What aircraft noise? I used the in-line volume control so that I could hear flight attendants and got off the aircraft without the usual fatigue that occurs through experiencing the relentless background noise.

I can wear these earphones with none of the fatigue that other earphones have given me. I think that this is not only due to the comfort of the fit, but also the way that the music is experienced; it feels as though you are listening to speakers rather than earphones, but its better than that because the noise isolation gives you freedom from external distractions.

In the two months that I have been using the SE846s I have found nothing that gives me any cause for regretting the purchase. They appear to be expensive, but all things are relative. Some people spend more than this in a year on other things that are gone once consumed. I used my SE530s for years and I am sure that the SE846 will serve me even longer. With the SE846 Shure has broken new ground, so if you love your music and you can find the money, don't hesitate, go for it!"
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greta sound. Excellent quality.
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow,

The sound that comes out of these earphones are phenomenal. The resistance on the SE846 is 9ohms VS. 36ohs for the SE535, with that plus four drivers these earphones are a no brainer. The price for these have double and now that I've had them for a while there is no buyers regret. I never paid much attention to cases and that was an expensive lesson, I broke the right SE535 by stepping on it in the middle of the night (which is why I picked these up). The packaging with the earphones compliments the sound, one clear hard plastic case and the usual hard Shure square case.

The price hasn't changed much on the SE535 so I picked up two because these earphones are worth the retail price. I use Surefire earplugs with these earphones, it gives me stand off from sweat when I'm working out and it's an extremely comfortable fit for long periods of time. Since I use the earplugs I've never been worried about isolation (even though isolation and sound quality go together, more outside noise kept out means more noise goes in the ears), so if you use the earplugs that came with the earphones and they are comfortable that works. I travel a lot so a good set headphones are essential and the smaller the better for obvious reasons.

If you want the best sound out of these earphones a quality MP3 player is a must. These earphones will sound good with most MP3 players because the resistance is low. I purchased a Hifiman 901 to use for traveling or doing house work. I figured I would buy a Excellent MP3 Player and a Excellent set of earphones VS. buying an Excellent set of closed headphones. Give me a month or two and I will update this review. Hopefully this helps

One last thing, I've been using sure earphones since 2007 and their customer service is on par with Apple. If your going to spend this much money make sure to register your product on their website so there is no issue's if you have to send them in. Before they made detachable cable I had to send my earphones in a few times. I would also recommend buying these from Amazon and not a third party.

Update:

I've had a serious wake up call after listening to the shure 846 with the Hifiman 901, amazing sound and clarity is an understatement. I've purchased headphones that cost more than the SE846 and disappointment is the best way to describe listening to them. The 846 runs a frequency range of 15hz-20khz, most high end headphones run from 5hz-46000khz+. Most portable music players only produce sound from 20hz-20khz. For the higher end headphones that use to be my portable travel headphones. They will be put away until a portable player comes around that can produce lower frequency for bass. Shure hit these earphones out of the park. I'm already excited for the next generation of earphones (probably won't be out for another 4 years). Take your time and do the research when it comes to your portable music player. These headphones will make the most basic cell phone DAC sound good. Pick up something dedicated to music and the 846's will sound like whatever artist your listening to is standing right beside you singing in your ears."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Shure earphones are splendid and have changed the way I hear music from average to superlative sound. I wish they made hearing aids too.
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound!
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had many, many , many pairs of high end earbuds, and i have to say these are my absolute favorite. the sound is incredibly well balanced and the low end is much more pronounced than the se-535's, it is literally no comparison, but still a very natural balanced sound unlike many of the can headphones out there these days. So if you are an audiophile and love to hear things how they were meant to be heard in incredibly clear detail, these are your headphones. If you are a bashed that likes to crank your bass, there are many other cheaper alternatives out there, as heavy bass is what these were built for."
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, great sound.

I've had quite a few pairs of headphones and these have the best sound BY FAR.

The sound is so clear - truly amazing. The bass is very good - much better than the Shure 400 series.

Sound isolation is good.

They really are a joy to listen to."
1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic IEMs, not much to be said that other reviewers haven't already said. If you've got the means you won't be disappointed."
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought these with some level of skepticism regarding whether they would be worth it. I was a previous owner of the SE535's and was relatively satisfied with them although I always felt they didn't go low enough or high enough but their midrange was buttery and unparalleled. I took the dive with these 846's and I am sure glad I did. The extension that I was looking for on both ends is present. I haven't felt the need to try out the low or high filters as I am completely satisfied with the neutral ones. The thing I find remarkable is that I find myself turning down the volume on these. They are so detailed and balanced across the sound spectrum that there is no need to play them loud. The low end is visceral and unlike anything I've ever heard in an earphone. You really feel like you have a subwoofer in your ears. At the same time the bass never overwhelms. I particularly notice that drums are incredibly articulate and textured. Everything else is outstanding. The ear tips do a great job of sealing out external noises (although Westones' ear tips are the best IMO). In short, these are keepers and are likely the last earphones I will ever purchase."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price. I use these every day. They have fantastic sound in my ears and the block out all the noise. Highly recommend.
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these with high hopes in part because I previously purchased the SE 535, which sound great. I was looking to upgrade and took the dive for $1000 based on the performance of the SE 535. Well, after several weeks of ownership and listening to various types of music from soft to hard, I can honestly say I am a tad disappointed. While I can discern a slight difference in the overall sound performance between the SE 846 and the SE 535, it is hard for me to justify the price tag on these based on the overall sound difference. The SE 846 do offer a bit more clarity in sound, but again it doesn't justify the difference in price from the SE 535. Additionally, I found these somewhat cumbersome to place in my ears and when I did they kept falling out. It took me an hour or so to figure these things out and get them into my ear so that I could really hear them clearly. So, in sum, while these are nice, they are not worth the price tag, at least not in my opinion."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing comes nearly as close as these IEMs.

I have tried lots. But for well rounded base, an equal amount of highs and balanced mids, this is it!

But it would be an insult to engineering to listen to MP3s on these delights.

trust me.

Listen to ""Watch Your Step"" or ""Sahara Sun"" by Darshan Ambient on 24-bit/96KHz FLAC. Of course you will need the Onkyo HF player for iOS or Android."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent IEMs, i've been using them for around 2 months. I'm coming from Westone UM Pro 50s, which fell apart at the plastic casing seam twice now in one year. My only complaint would be that they are considerably bulkier and less comfortable than the UM Pro 50s (which have 5 armature drivers, instead of 4 on these, but no ""subwoofer""), and i have large ears. The cables are also far more stiff and noticable over the ear. They do feel far more solid in terms of build quality, however.

As for the audio quality, they obviously do not disappoint. I love the filter feature, I initially tried the whites and didn't like them at all but the blue filters were the absolute perfect balance for my type of music."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These replace the nearly 3 year old se425s I've been using. Ordered them Amazon Prime, overnight $3.99 shipping...14 hours after the order was placed the package is delivered. And the new packaging is not to be ignored, it's very nice. As for the earphones, Ive been listening to them for about an hour so far...just on a Macbook Air. And all I'll say is: Seriously, be prepared to be blown away. $1000 buys you sonic happiness. They're very LOUD! Crispy clean sound, and the bass explodes--no joke. Everything I've thrown at them sounds incredible...These are amazing earphones."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy moly these are neutral. Nothing stands out or bites, everything is just RIGHT. The best IEMs in the world."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I'm thrilled with the clarity and soundstage, among other attributes of this fantastic set of IEM's. I'm waiting on a DAC to be delivered to bring them to the next level."

1,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding. Like nothing I've ever heard before.
2,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just bassy goodness. Get them.
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful sound, but also a very accurate sounding earphone. Once you hear these, you won't want to listen to anything else."
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound-
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an armchair audiophile with some old MFSL material and tube amps. These are the best-sounding earbuds I have ever used; I have tried all types and have settled on the SE 535 - pretty good but not great - until I found these. The low cycle bass is reproduced with clarity, precision, and volume. The high end does not saturate. The earbuds come with dampers to customize the high end for personal taste. The harshness of cymbal crashes and electric guitars is gone. Boston's MFSL Third Stage Gold CD tends to be heavy on the highs. With the SE846, the highs are smooth and clear. I am thoroughly amazed at these earbuds. They sound great powered by iPhone 5s."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me prelude this review by saying that the first order of these headphones that Amazon shipped wound up missing after delivery, and after contacting Amazon after waiting 2 days for it to hopefully show up (which it didn't,) Amazon sent a replacement. A+ for the customer service. Now on to the review.
I purchased these for my boyfriend, and he is blown away by how detailed these IEMs are. The bass is tight, fast, and has punch, but does not distort nor take away from the full and detailed mids and highs. Soundstage is very impressive for an IEM, and trumps several full size cans. Instrument seperation is very precise and detailed, and there is not a single complaint I've heard from him about then. Strongly recommend if you have the cash for them."
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"REVISED: The right side has died. No sound whatsoever. Unbelievable after only 5 months (!). What should I do.

Here is my first review. My, things have changed. I am NOT willing to try another pair.

After trying so many IEMs and finding so many to have at least one fatal sonic flaw I realized, being a professional musician, that I should've just saved my time and spent the big bucks for these mini-monsters. Unbelievable sound, never ceases to amaze. Tried so many Westones and they all have a warm, muddy and/or recessed mid range--so frustrating as the overall sound quality of the Westones is so wonderful. I wish I'd never wasted my time listening to so many of the Westones: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, Pro, non-pro, etc. They are ALL flawed. Suggest you not waste your time either, and just go for these 846s. Skip the 535s--they are lacking in any realistic bass response or balance. The 846s: sonic bliss, and all music shines."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphone I ever listen in my life! Thank u Shure!
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are exquisite.
0,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a hardcore audiophile but that I do enjoy listening to music and travel quite a bit for work and am constantly on the hunt for new IEM's and headphones to use when traveling on planes/etc. That being said, I'd probably describe myself more as an enthusiast rather than a hardcore audiophile.

I was in the market for some high end IEM's and was choosing between the Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad HiDef MicroDrivers, Crystal Clear and Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black). I was looking to upgrade from my Shure SE535-CL Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable (Clear) and Westone UM 3X In-Ear Musician's Monitor, Universal Fit Earphone with Removable Cable, Clear, 79292 (I have the RC removable cable version of the UM3x's). Anyway, I ended up buying the SE846's and found a pair of used IE800's on another site so now I have all four of these IEM's and plan on selling the SE535's and UM3x's. I know I really don't need two sets of IEM's but with the SE846 and IE800 I love them both so much that I don't really want to sacrifice one or the other. In any case, since I have all four of them now I thought it'd be helpful to some of you out there who may want to know a bit more about these at least in terms of how I rank them.

I'll be ranking them using the following criteria (which I adapted from a well known user on head-fi) on a scale from 1-10 each:

Bundled Accessories - Which ones come with the best and most comprehensive list of accessories
Build Quality - How well I feel they will hold up over time
Isolation - How well they block out ambient noise
Microphonics - How much cable noise you hear when moving around
Comfort - How comfortable each one are after wearing for extended use (over an hour on plane for example)
Sound - This is a bit subjective as all people tend to hear details differently in the sound so I'll do my best to describe why I rank them the way I do
Value - For the money which one is best?

::Shure SE846:: - 65/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9.5/10 - Shure really didn't leave anything out when they put this package together. It comes with a large plastic case like a pelican case as well as a zippered case. It also comes with a plethora of tips and most interestingly a set of 2 additional tubes that can be inserted in to the IEM's that change the sound of the SE846's. I opted to stay with the pre-installed neutral tubes. The only thing that would have been nice is if they included an iPhone/Android compatible cable. At the price they are asking it should be a throw in...

::Build Quality::
10/10 - All plastic with the exception of the ear nozzle which is metal. From what I hear this is the most susceptible part to break so it's nice they changed them to metal from the previous generations plastic nozzles.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pair, Small) with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
8.5/10 - These are LARGE IEM's. With everything packed in to the SE846's I suppose you could say that they are small but compared to the SE535's these are noticeably larger and if you have smaller ears you may have some comfort issues with these. I've found that I can wear these for extended periods of use but find myself adjusting them from time to time depending on how much I am moving around.

::Sound::
10/10 - The sub bass is incredible in these little IEM's. I thought I could hear bass in some of my other IEM's but these take it to another level with the low frequencies it can go down to. The bass is there and not overwhelming and the highs are crisp and clear. I find the soundstage to be wide on these but not as wide as the Sennheiser IE800's. Overall, the sound on these is excellent! Also worth noting is the VERY low impedance of only 9 ohms! This means that they can easily be driven from mobile devices and get good volume without having to turn it all the way up!

::Value::
8/10 - At the price they ask for these, I can't say that they are the best value but they are some seriously great sounding IEM's.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE846's seem to be an evolutionary step in a long line of IEM's. I've had many Shure's dating back to the e2c's, SE425's, SE535's and now the SE846's. As time progressed and Shure refined and improved their products I've been with them along for the ride and I'm happy to say that the SE846's have many welcome evolutionary steps above and beyond what they've done before. The sub bass is amazing in an IEM and the other improvements like the metal nozzles and removable tubes to change the sound are great. Coming from their previous flagships, the SE535's, I can see that they've put a lot of thought and effort in to these and can say that the higher price is fully justified... if only they'd redesigned the iPhone compatible cable and included it with them too! Honestly, though, that's the ONLY downside I see in these IEM's is that they don't include an iPhone compatible cable like their competitors. Other than that, these are some of the best IEM's on the market today and I highly recommend them.

::Sennheiser IE800:: - 60/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9/10 - Not a lot comes with these but what it does come with is REALLY nice. The case is by far one of the best cases I've ever used for IEM's. The case has a cutout inside the case to put them in and the cable wraps around the case nicely so you never have to deal with tangled cords. The IE800's come with a set of replaceable silicone tips that can be cleaned and reused by just running them under the sink with some soap and water... NICE! The only thing as with all of these is that at the price they ask for them they should include an iPhone/Android compatible cable. The other thing you should know is that the tips are proprietary so there are no officially documented comply tips that will work but I hear that some of the comply tips will work.

::Build Quality::
10/10 - Ceramic housings and a kevlar cable... no other IEM on the market can say that as far as I know... built like a tank

::Isolation::
8/10 - The bundled silicone tips do an adequate job of blocking ambient noise but they aren't going to block noise as well as others.

::Microphonics::
5/10 - By far the worst microphonics I've heard out of an IEM. Try not to move much when using these... I think it's mostly due to the downward position of the IE800's when inserted in to your ears. If you're lucky enough to be able to wrap the cord around your ear so you can use them as over ear IEM's then do it. It vastly improves the microphics of the cable. Unfortunately it's a bit uncomfortable when I wear them this way as the upper part of the cable past the Y is only about 9.5 inches.

::Comfort::
10/10 - These are so small and light that they really disappear when you insert them in to your ears. I find that I can wear these for extended periods with ZERO problems. They may be the most comfortable IEM's I've had to date.

::Sound::
10/10 - The frequency response on these IEM's is really really nice! It's amazing you can get such rich sound out of a single driver IEM. I was skeptical at first since I'm used to multiple driver IEM's but after hearing these I can say that I'm convinced! I do feel that the mids are more pronounced on these than the SE846's which is nice for certain types of music. The bass is also good on these IEM's... Overall it's a nice and rich full sounding IEM. It's worth noting here that the designer of the acclaimed $1500 Sennheiser HD800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Premiere Headphone also designed these... I've never heard the HD800's but I've read that the IE800's are like mini HD800's. Also, the low impedance of 16 ohms means that it can be driven relatively easily by mobile devices. On my iPhone I can get more than adequate volume from these without having to turn it up too much.

::Value::
8/10 - Yes they are expensive but they sound great and are extremely comfortable to wear.

::CONCLUSION::
These are great little IEM's and I mean little! I'm wearing these right now going on over an hour with them on at my desk and I don't feel any fatigue at all... and the sound!! The sound is nice and crisp with good bass response and instrument separation despite being driven only by a single driver. Although the Shure SE846's do have some more bass response in the low low end, sound wise I still put these on the same level for it's overall richness and sound. Great IEM's and highly recommended!!

::Shure SE535:: - 60.5/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
8/10 - Comes with a case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use... The bundled accessories are acceptable for an IEM in this price range but I feel like they could have included a bit more like an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These are fairly light IEM's and feel great in the ear and I have had no issues with them wearing them for extended periods.

::Sound::
8/10 - Nice and crisp highs and mids! The bass lacks a bit when compared to the Westone UM3x's and of course when compared to the Shure SE846's it will be lacking too but nonetheless if you're more in to mids and highs then you can't go wrong with these. These are some nice and neutral IEM's IMHO. These impedance on these is 36 ohms which means that it can be driven from most mobile devices without the need for much amplification.

::Value::
8.5/10 - If you're in the market for a pair of neutral IEM's these are the ones to go with.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE535's have now been eclipsed by the SE846's but not everyone will want to spend that kind of $$ on the SE846's. At their price the SE535's are still a tremendous IEM that has a great neutral sound with good mids and highs but lacking a bit in the bass department. They are still enjoyable to listen to and are actually more comfortable (to me) than the SE846's due to their smaller design. Recommended for those looking for a really good, neutral IEM.

::Westone UM3x RC:: - 63/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
7/10 Comes with the standard case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use. The zippered case is nice and compact but I feel like they should have also included their Westone Monitor Vault - Smoke Gray for them as well. Also, like all of these, they should include an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
10/10 - The Westone Epic cable is by far the best I've used in terms of microphonics. The cable is thin and light so it really causes no issues in this regard.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These feel about the same to me in ear as the Shure SE535's... great for extended use.

::Sound::
9/10 - The mids and highs on these IEM's are crisp and clear but these also pack a punch when it comes to bass. They don't pack as much punch as say the Shure SE846's or even the Sennheiser IE800's but at this price point they are very nice full sounding IEM's. These IEM's have an impedance of 56 ohms... they can be driven from mobile devices but you'll definitely find yourself turning it up a bit.

::Value::
10/10 - For the price I feel that these are a very good value... good sound, good comfort, and good price!

::CONCLUSION::
I initially bought the UM3x's on a whim at the airport mostly because I craved something with a bit more low end bass over the SE535's... this was of course before the SE846's came out and the Sennheiser IE800's... nonetheless, after auditioning these I bought them on the spot. The highs and mids sound good (not as good as the Shure SE535's but good enough for me) and these IEM's do provide the bass response that I was looking for that the SE535's were lacking. They're warmer sounding to me than the SE535's and more fun because of it. Depending on my mood (before I got the SE846's and IE800's) I'd switch between the SE535's and UM3x's. I recommend these highly!

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see from above these are ALL really nice IEM's and for various reasons I've ranked them all very highly.

HIGH OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you have the money definitely go for the Shure SE846's or Sennheiser IE800's... They are both well worth the money IMO. The SE846's may be better for those of you on the go a lot (because of the low impedance and low microphonics in the cable) while the IE800's are probably better suited for at home use or for people who won't be moving around much (due to the microphonics issue).

LOWER OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you're budget is on the lower end of the high end IEM market then I have no hesitation in recommending either the Westone UM3x RC's or Shure SE535's... the difference between those is mostly in the sound signature. The SE535's are more neutral sounding to me while the UM3x's have a bit more umph when it comes to bass response.

It should be noted that Westone has recently released the Westone UM Pro 30 Smoke (Universal Monitor Earphones) and Westone UM Pro 20 High Performance Dual Driver in-ear Headphone of which I auditioned both at a store... These would definitely both be worth looking in to... the accessory bundles alone would be worth it over the competition. They come with a regular cable and iPhone/Android compatible cable and a nice plastic pelican case-like case. My wife got the UM Pro 20's and she's very happy with them and uses them every day."

previously. These are much better - bass, clarity, wider/deeper soundstage."
3,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best evah!
4,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are expensive headphones, but they sound great. I would recommend using with a DAC and high quality FLAC files.
I've had these earphones for about 3 months now and they sound great. I use them almost every night after work to relax.
The bass is not overpowering and the vocals sound great. These headphones are not for everyone due to the price, but if you like high quality sound, I would recommend."
5,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"one of the best purchases ever. I didn't know all my head phones and ear buds where crap until I tried these.
believe me I only buy the best of everything. or so I thought until this. this is quite one of the best ear buds around. if you like music this is a must."
6,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
7,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have long used the SE535 headphones, which I think are among the very best on the market. When it came time to replace a pair, I upgraded to the 846. I am amazed. The balance and clarity in every range is remarkable. I have heard new notes, phrases, and instruments in music I've listened to for years because of the clear mix. I listen to a wide variety of music from Wilco to Brad Meldhau to Jason Isbell to Wagner et cetera. I'm also an amateur musician and use these headphones to mix my own compositions. While Shure promotes the bass quality, I don't listen to (and don't usually enjoy) bass-heavy music. My sense is they will faithfully deliver the bass as the artist intended.

They are not cheap, clearly. The SE 535 headphones are very, very good, but honestly, the 846's are noticeably, discernibly superior. If you care deeply about the quality richness of sound, I can highly recommend these headphones."
8,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although those earphones are incredibly expensive, they're totally worth it. The quality of the sound that they produce is out of this world. The subwoofer works perfectly. You can actually feel the earphones vibration with bass sounds. It's a must have for musicians that can afford that price. I am really impressed."
9,Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad High Definition...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Just wow. I've owned the Shure SE530 and SE535s before these and didn't think headphones could sound any better but my ears were blown out of the water when I listened to these. There are no words to describe how far the range of sound these go. They are better than any in-ear and over-ear headphones/earphones I have ever heard. My go-to over ear headphones right now are the V-Moda M100s but after buying these I never want to take them off ever again. I have used these listening to lossless music on my MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPod classic and Nexus 5 (with PowerAmp Music App). I also have a Fiio portable headphone amp but with these headphones I've noticed I don't really see a huge difference when I'm using the amp.

I hear details in songs I've never heard when using normal speakers, and watching movies on my laptop is completely immersive now. This is the way sound is meant to be heard, almost better than real life. :) What's even better is the ability to physically change the sound yourself with three customizable frequency response nozzles. I kept the neutral in as I felt the high and low nozzles were too extreme in distorting the sounds.

I listen to all kinds of music from pop, classical, rock, acoustic, instrumental and many other genres and everything sounds as if I were listening to it live. If you're into bass, these definitely hit the spot. There's a kind of 'rumble' in the bass that makes your hairs stick up with the right song. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these headphones, I would give it 100 stars if I could. I was hesitant to upgrade from my 535s for a while, especially since they were double the price and I wasn't sure it was worth spending so much for headphones. I'm not an audiophile or professional by any means but this has got to be the best $1000 I have ever spent.

To top it off Shure included a huge fancy polycarbonate case with a ton of accessories and interchangeable parts, and even an extra cable that would normally cost you $50!! I'm in love, and you will be too."
