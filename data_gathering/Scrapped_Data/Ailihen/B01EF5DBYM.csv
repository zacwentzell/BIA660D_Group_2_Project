First, I bought the Green/grey pair for my daughter, and she loved them. I liked them so much, I had to order a pair for myself! They are very comfortable, look great, and sound great. The cord is a nice braided cable that resists tangling. Love them! I uploaded pictures of both so you can see the colors.",Gorgeous color and fit!

Was this review helpful to you?, July 28 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really lightweight, good for children too. I let my 4 year old wear them some times. At first I thought they wouldnt expand out to fit my head but found out if you pull them a little harder its (hard to notice at first) they do adjust. And the mic works well. The sound is nice, but for my ears I cant wear them for more than a few hours. Otherwise, theyre good for normal use if your not going to sit all day with them on.","Good for the price, and look cute too"

I was having trouble talking on the phone for long periods of time because of needing to be mobile and use both hands. This was the perfect solution. Adjustable and fit comfortably, blocks out about 95% of the outside noise and the other party can hear you crystal clear.",Great product

Was this review helpful to you?, July 26 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 8 year old son can be very hard on headphones. I bought him these to replace a set that the audio was cutting in and out on due to a crimped cord. The first thing I noticed about these is that they seemed well made for the price. These are much sturdier than the ones he had before. The sound is very nice offering crisp highs and nice lows without distortion. There are two features that I especially liked; first of all they fold up which makes it easier to for travel and to put in his backpack (he has to have his own set of headphones for school). Folded up in his back pack they are much less likely to get twisted, broken, etc. Secondly, I like the in line volume control. It is a slide switch not an up/down button that changes the volume on the device. What this allows me to do is to set the maximum volume level on the device and then he can control it through the slide switch up to that point. This is great for kids that tend to turn the volume up excessively.","A great set of headphones, especially for children."

I can watch a movie or show on my laptop while my husband watches TV and it almost completely covers up the noise from HIS shows. The fit is comfortable on the ears, as the pads are quite generous, and I like that you can adjust these to be longer or shorter, depending on the size of your head. The sound quality is good - but if you're looking for Bose quality - it's not going to happen. If that's what you want - then go pay for it and don't complain about THESE. These are quite good for the price.",Quite good for the price!

Was this review helpful to you?, August 5 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product is absolutely fabulous my daughter can talk on her tablet with face time and you can hear her clearly. The sound is crisp the headphones adjust to her head and stay on snuggly. It has a long battery life as well she played for hours and it never shut off on her. The only downside is that I wear glasses so when I use these I can't wear them for too long or my ears hurt from my frames. Overall very happy.,Overall very happy.

Was this review helpful to you?, October 17 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great little entry level headphones. If you have a teen or young adult and just want to have a little peace in the car, and let them jam out, these are for you.

Pros:

1) the headband is very comfortable to wear. I love that these fit well, and do not squeeze your head. My five year old can wear these pretty easily on the smallest setting, but they do border on being just a bit big.

2) the ear pieces are also comfortable, and cup my ears nicely. They do a decent job of dampening the sound, but they are not sound canceling. They do a great job for the price!

3) sound and sound control are nice and work well. These have great sound for entry level headphones.

4) I ordered the teal, and these are awesome. The color was pleasing to 5 and 8 year old girls, and our 13yr old nephew.

5) phone microphone is ok. Not the best ever, but it works, and I haven't had too many issues.

Cons:

1) I don't really have any cons. They are great for the price!",awesome entry level headphones.

These were great for about three or four months but have now stopped playing sound out of the right ear. It wasn't like I was constantly using them either, I'm not a huge headphone person so would usually try to listen to something straight out of the device so it wasn't really them just getting over used or abused--for the most part they stayed in my desk drawer until I needed them and then one day when I needed them, the sound in the right ear kept cutting in and out and now it's gone altogether and will pop up occasionally if I move in just the right way.",Great until they decided to only play out of one ear

Was this review helpful to you?, October 19 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This head phone set is exactly what I have been searching for. My job requires a lot of phone calls and these work great for that. When I get a phone call, I put this head set on, and then place my I phone in my short pocket, and I can move to get files, make copies and even stack fire wood. The head set fits well and is very comfortable. By covering both ears, I am not distracted from the caller. Also the volume works really good. It actually will hurt your ears if you do not turn it down quick enough on certain calls.",Excellent Head set for talking hands free on my iPhone. I would buy it again.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 29 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Another case of the buyer not understanding the technology, I guess. I bought these for my daughter who posts videos on YouTube a lot and is not happy with her microphone setup. So when she asked for headphones, and I found these that are described as having a built-in mic, and are compatible with phones and PCs, I thought this was the perfect thing. However, the mic part seems to be only activated when used with a phone, and not possible with a PC. I haven't found anything on the net that explains how to use the mic with a PC and would love feedback from any viewers if they have found the info. Also, the ear pieces seem uncomfortable for my large head. The pressure is too tight and the pieces are too small. I enjoy using Sony professional headphones for work. My 11 year old hasn't complained about their size, though.","May be comfortable for a smaller head, and can't use the mic with a PC"

Was this review helpful to you?, November 18 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The structure of the headset is tough and durable. Not too find that it is wired since they were for my young son who doesn't keep still very well. The cord is long enough but personally think it could be a little longer to give more freedom for movement. The earcuffs are a good size as well. The volume is not as loud as I would like but as I said before, theyh are for a found child so that is not all bad. They seem more appealing for kids rather than asuults but either one could use them.",The earcuffs are a good size as well

Unfortunately, due to a bit of a cable tangle yank situation, the tip of the headphone jack freely dislodged itself from the rest of the jack... directly into my phone. You would not believe how much trouble it is to get just the tip of an audio plug out of a phone, and how many problems it creates when your phone thinks a headphone is there that really isn't. Bummer!",Just the tip

Was this review helpful to you?, August 18 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my children for school. The price was good and didn't expect much in the quality category but was pleasantly surprised. We're good out of the box and they have held up good thus far. Would recommend these if your not looking for high end headphones with a high price. Sound quality is average but for ththe price you can't beet them,Good for the price.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 12 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Higher quality than I expected for under $20. Sound is acceptable. Bass and low notes not great, but if you are listening on a computer to higher quality audio, you can still enjoy it. This isn't what a huge audiophile would use daily, but someone who just wants to Netflix binge without waking kids, this is a great choice. The build quality is surprisingly solid, with a braided reinforced cord. Microphone and volume control slider built into cord work just fine. Probably would be the most comfortable for someone with small ears, as the ear pads and cups are small on the small side. Again, overall a better product than I expected for the price.","Bass and low notes not great, but if you are listening on a computer ..."
4,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, December 8 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited about these headphones. They're comfortable and cute. However they do have some drawbacks. My hair frequently gets caught in the hinges or pulled by the rubber lining, which is annoying but not a huge deal.

The headphone plug is fragile. I've had these for about two months but already the wires inside the plug are showing signs of wear, to the point where I have to frequently adjust the plug or press on the cord to get full sound. I normally keep these at the top of my backpack or tote bag, and thought I was taking good care of them, especially in contrast to my old iPhone headphones, which I frequently abused and would last a year or two before breaking down.

If you're only planning to use these at your office desk and never unplug them or take them anywhere I'm sure they'll hold on fine (although the super long cord may get annoying). But if you're always on the go like me, spring for headphones that are more durable.",Fragile plug doesn't stand up to travel
5,Was this review helpful to you?, May 22 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much bass, but what can you expect for under $20? I was pleasantly surprised that the sound was clear and the headphones comfortable. Honestly I was expecting to have to throw these out but based on the good reviews I was willing to give them a whirl.

I use them for a very long ferry and bus commute to and from work (you really don't want to do that with expensive earphones, trust me!). These serve their porpoise of making it clear I'm busy so I get left alone ;) but they also really do have decent sound. Not awesome sound, but far better than I anticipated considering the price.

I would definitely recommend these if you need a pair you aren't afraid to knock around a little bit. And to that point, it's been a month or so and there is literally nothing damaged on these either, so I suspect their durability will prove to be impressive as well!",Great for kids and commuting - good sound

Over the years I must have bought her probably 6 different pairs and in almost 3/4 of those I ended up taking them back or keeping them for myself. They were too big, too tight, they were ugly.

I really hope they last, but only time will tell.",My wife thinks they are cute.

Not just for the price, but actually sound pretty good. I got them for my son, and out of curiosity tried them out for myself. Now, they don't sound quite as good as my Sony studio monitors, or my wife's Beats Studios, but they are pretty close. No idea how durable they are, time will tell as my 7 year old uses and abuses them. I'll be happy to get a year out of them for $20.",These are good sounding headphones

I am not disappointed one bit. The sound that these things put out is amazing. You can hear the bass, the mid range and the tweeters. They are so loud that I cannot listen the volume at it's max.

Mine broke after about 6 months which seems like a decent run, but they just stay at my desk at work. First one side, now both sides. Unless I tilt my head in a weird way and don't move. I imagine if you're going to be using these more regularly and taking them around they would not last as long.

They are noise canceling and the wrapped cord is perfect. The cord is extra long so you can do whatever you need to. These are stylish.

My son was thrilled with them initially (they looked cool and worked well). Unfortunately this didn't last long. About 2 weeks after getting back from our trip (and about a month after receiving the headphones), the audio connector snapped off inside my son's kindle fire. Not only did this make his headphones unusable (cable is an integral part of the headphones), but also kept him from hearing any sound from his kindle. I ended up having to take his kindle apart to remove the broken piece. This was not any easy task, and I'm lucky I didn't destroy the kindle in the process.",Nearly destroyed my son's Kindle

Was this review helpful to you?, November 18 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to buy new headphones thanks to my cat chewing through my old ones. I love theses ones because it has a nice durable nylon cord that so far has thwarted the attempts of my cats sharp teeth whenever he manages to attack them while I'm using them. One my favorite things about these headphones is how sound isolative they are, perfect for being able to zone out to my music without being disturbed by any background noise, plus they look nice and are well put together. They are also better quality than ones that I have payed more for in the past so I'm definitely in love with them. Besides the cat, im pretty harsh on headphones myself but I have had these ones for close to a month I believe and I have not had any issues with any kind of parts coming off or the cord breaking easily. At this point I don't have anything bad to say and I'd recommend them to anyone wanting decent headphones without having to spend a fortune on some",Sleek & Durable

The earbuds that came with my iPhone have sound quality a million times better than these headphones... 30 seconds of listening and I knew I was going to need to return them. Also the volume control doesn't actually adjust the volume on your device, only raises or lowers on top of the volume you've already set on the device. I had to crank the volume way up on my phone and increase the volume on the headphones to reach the level I usually use with my other headphones.

I knew at $20 sound quality was going to be a gamble, but the other positive reviews convinced me to try them. Now I'm out the return shipping, so learn from my mistake and pick some higher quality/more expensive headphones if sound quality is important to you.",Terrible Sound Quality

All kidding aside--and my jokes are terrible ones--these are lovely headphones. I'm not a headphone aficionado, but these perform just as well as several higher-priced pairs I've had over the years. Plus they're cool. The cord is wrapped in fabric and stuff. It's awesome. They're also massively comfortable and I've worn them for hours at a time without feeling the pinch.

My only complaint is that the sound adjustment is a light touch. It goes from, ""Eh, I could use a little more sound."" to, ""HOLY ****BALLS I CAN'T FEEL MY EARS""

These are some good headphones, but having them on my ears for prolonged periods of time cause my ears to sweat, clogging them, and hurts them a little bit. More.. Unconfortable, than painful, actually. The ear cups are NOT made for larger ears. I have pretty normal sized ears, and they're smaller, and don't fit over them like I personally like in headphones (I like my ears inside my headphones. I don't like them on top of my ears, if you know what I mean.) They are actually three colors, The mint, a slightly darker mint where it folds, and the grey all around. Four if you count the silver part that extends to fit your head. Speaking of that, that part is kind of a fingerprint magnet, and I suggest wiping it off if its touched a lot, especially with sweaty hands. They cancel out some noise, and on top of that, are fairly loud. So yeah. Good overall. Have a good day people.",Heyaheyaheyahey

Pro-tip: If you come across headphones that go for under $25 and have a white nylon braided cord?

I read a lot of them and these headphones seemed like a good choice. Cheap, good looking and claim to have crisp and clear sound.

However, once I got the product things started to get pretty ""meh"" in terms of quality. The packaging was obviously very cheap, but not a major concern.
The build quality seems very sub-par. They look good in the picture, but in reality they are very much plastic and I feel like I am going to break them every time I try to fold them. The ear cushions are somewhat comfortable, but feel awkward (as if they're backwards) on the ears.

Here's my least favorite part though: most of the reviews claim ""crisp and clear sound quality"". I completely disagree. These sound like cheap small earbuds that come standard with the purchase of a phone. I compared these to my pair of Urbanears (which are only about 30 bucks more to buy) and the difference in clarity is instantly noticeable. So if you are buying to replace standard phone earbuds, maybe invest a little more in a better pair of headphones.

I will give 3 stars because they're not horrible considering they're $20, so you pretty much get what you paid for. However, I'm disappointed that the majority of the reviews for the product did not accurately represent what I was getting, especially in terms of sound quality.",Beware of the many 5 star reviews - Sound quality not great

Pros:
- Decent sound
- Folding
- Adjustable
- I like the slide volume switch.

Cons:
- Ear pieces are rigid. I mean they do not rotate to meet the ears so they feel tighter on the rear of my ears, and touch much more lightly on the front of my ears. The soft pads help a bit to compensate for the rigid ear pieces.
- The ear pads are not larger than my ears. The headphones set on top of my ears rather than surround my ears. This makes them less comfortable and they don't cut out ambient noise as well.",Good for the price.

Also, the volume adjusting mechanism on the headset cord is very strange; there aren't separate buttons for + and - like there are on most other headsets. You have to use the switcher to toggle from + or -, then the button will affect whichever volume selection you're toggled to. Photo for clarity.

It is a slider control. I just use the volume control on my phone to adjust the volume. The CORD is awesome. Its like a shoelace that doesn't tangle up on you. They are easy to adjust to your head.

Had a difficult time getting it out. She's six so I am not sure if she was too rough when she inserted the headphones or if it was a defect. I know it wasn't because she dropped the tablet or something like that. It has a warranty but I figure they will say it was her fault. My thought is that it should have been more durable so I'm giving it a 3. They don't look like cheap headphones and I like how they fold up and they worked great until the end broke.,Unsure

45 Days Update (1/3/16): These headphones just stopped working for no good reason. No one could hear me properly and all the audio I was receiving was inconsistent and garbled. I have not done anything to ""abuse"" these headphones; I only use them for work, so they're either on my desk or in a section of my backpack",Garbage. Broke After 45 Days.

The audio was good the ear cups were cushion nice. It did not felt like my head was being squish like a water ballon like other headphones.

Volume control is a bit annoying in its placement - because of where it is on the cord, I kept adjusting the volume down by accident.

The headphones are also comfortable, with good adjustability.","The headphones are also comfortable, with good adjustability"

I was in desperate need of new headphones and decided to try this AILHEN set out. They were really nicely packaged and easy to open. This product does come with a warranty, which is reassuring, just in case something happens to it. The headphones fold in, making them ready to throw in a purse or backpack. The plugin part comes with a plastic protective piece which is a nice little bonus and very easy to remove. The headphones are very comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. You can just move the ears up and down to your size. I do like that they are padded and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I just wish that they were larger. Most headphones and earbuds have a volume up and down button, this has a slide for volume. It is silent and very easy to use. There is also a play/pause button too that works for music and phone calls too. This is great pair of universal headphones!

The padding is comfortable, but the headphone structure itself is not really adjustable, and it sits just slightly askew on your ears, putting pressure points in the wrong spots.

►► SOUND QUALITY ◄◄

The sound here is fairly lacking across the board from fairly weak bass to a mid-range and high-end that never quite feel like they're crisp and clear. Listening to various things with these headphones I got the feeling everything was just a bit muffled as the headphones tried to keep up with the music. The sound here might be better than the earbuds that come with most phones but it is not far and beyond better.

►► COMFORT ◄◄

I am a big guy, at 6'6"" I have a larger than average head. I did have to extend these as far as they would go but once I did they fit comfortably. The earpads are nice and soft and are comfortable to wear.

►► CONCLUSION ◄◄

The overall sound quality is just not there with this set of headphones. If you really want an over the ear headphone I'd suggest spending a few more dollars and getting something better. If you're ok with earbuds I've tested out plenty of in-ear headphones in the $20 range that blew these away.

He wore them one time and stopped using them. I asked him why, because they actually looked nice with a modern tech appearance. My son explained how the headphones didn't fit good on his head and began hurting shortly after putting them on. I decided to try them on myself... and found that the headphones are really stiff on the head. When I say stiff... I mean stiff! There is no horizontal movement built into the earcups whatsoever that would compensate for a more comfortable fit. No matter how I positioned the headphones on my head, there was always a small crack between the earcups and my head... therefore never providing a complete seal around the ear.

Overall: Bargain beat em up headphones with a bargain sound. After boosting the Bass in EQ settings they sound much fuller and less flat. Sound is muddled with no distinction of lows/mids. It feels cheaply made, which I expected, but I can't find too many weak spots on the construction. They look decent. The ear pads are surprisingly soft and well padded, but the top of the head strap is a bit hard. The clamp of the headphones is adequate for most movements and only slides around a small amount. Monoprice headphones are still leagues better. These are my goto now when I listen to audiobooks or podcasts while working out.

2,Was this review helpful to you?, July 15 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These would be a five star headphone set if they cancelled out all background noises when having them on, like if I'm watching a tv show on my iPad I can still hear my kids bickering in the background, which I'd prefer not to hear if possible. Other than that they fit comfortably, I really like the way they adjust automatically to your head size so there isn't any playing around with sizing it properly, and all the features are easily accessible and in convienent places. The orange color is a nice solid vibrant color, the cushion on the ear pieces is comfortable for about an hour or so and then I need to take them off for a little bit and give my ears some free space before putting them back on, it does start to irritate my ears after about an hour or so, but most headphones do that so it's definitely not a deal breaker for me. The price has got to be one of the best features about these headphones, as they do multifunction with a mic built in, the fold up, can adjust the volume and skip back and fourth thru music and shows easily with the touch of a button on the headset and not have to access the device, and to do all that, and comfortably with decent sound quality at this price is a steal in my opinon. I'm no expert on sound quality, but it's definitely not bad, especially at this price.
Pros:
Fold up easily, little to no effort
Auto adjust to your head
Cushion comfortable for about an hour at a time
Sound quality about a 7 on a scale of 1-10
Mic option built in
Volume control button as well as fwd/rew
Corded so no running out of battery, and the cord is reinforced at the meet of the cord and headset making it ideal for wear and tear
Durable, have been dropped many times, even stepped on a few times and still together working just as great as day one.
Price is just a deal in my opinon and def worth noting in the pros for this headset with all these great features.

Cons:
Starts to irritate my ears after about an hour or so of wear, but that happens to me on most headsets.
Doesn't have any sort of travel pouch or case to keep them in, which would be nice for when not in use.
The sound quality obviously could be better, but to expect better than what it is, I would expect a significant price increase as well and therefore not really a con to me, but for some it may be with it not cancelling out background noises as well as I had hoped they did.

Overall I would have to say, honestly I'm impressed with these headphones and very happy with them. I would recommend them to my friends, especially for kids/teens since they do appear to be decently durable thus far. I have 4 boys and they have definitely been tested here and there and they still are intact, with nothing broken or damaged and working great still, which is key for me when buying headphones. I did recieve these at a discounted price, in exachage for my honest opinion of them. I'm very happy with this purchase, and was not compensated in anyway to purchase and test this headset out in anyway.","Durable, work well, and decent sound quality"

I would rate the sound quality as medium and the comfort of these headphones are okay as long as you do not wear them for extended periods of time.

It did not currently own a pair of over-the-ear headphones and wanted to try out a pair. Because of this and the fact that I loved the color, this was perfect product to try out and was very eye-catching at the same time. The following are my thoughts regarding this product.

**Pros
1. Color - The best thing about these headphones is really the bright teal color. The color is very vibrant and will certainly grab your attention.
2. Design - The design of these headphones is quite neat since it does fold into itself. So although this headphones is much more bulky in comparison to earphones it does compress in size based on its folding capability. I also like the packaging that it comes in and would make a perfect gift.
3. Sound - I was not sure whether to make this a pro or con but in the end I do think that the quality matches the list price of this item. You are able to hear the sound fairly clearly however if you listen to music at higher volumes your sound may become slightly distorted. For every day listening however this product will provide you what you're looking for.

**Cons
1. Comfort - This call may be more due to personal preference but I found that overtime the headphones become uncomfortable to wear. It may be due to the shape of my ear trying to conform to the headphones but I find that after more then half an hour, my ears start to hurt. You may not have this issue but depending on the shape of your ear, this became an issue with this particular headphones.

Broke in three months, after very light use. Bought them in January, tried to return them in March, but they are no longer returnable.

Used them for a few business calls on skype and to listen to music on the phone. The microphone still works (people can hear me on skype) but there is no sound coming out of the speakers. I've bought lots of headphones, expensive and inexpensive, and these have been by far the least-lasting.

The AILIHEN C8 Headphones came in a nice looking retail display package, which surprised me. Based on the price, I was assuming that they would arrive in a plain cardboard box or inside of a plastic bag.

I excitedly opened up the box and checked the headphones out. The headphones seemed to be made to a decent quality. They fit on my head well and adjust easily. The earphones indeed have a decent amount of cushioning on them. The cord measures approximately 5 foot in length, which was long enough to put my iPhone inside of my pant pocket. I then plugged the headphones into my iPhone; the sound quality was rather good. I really did not expect the headphones to sound satisfactory at all, but they actually sound as good as my last way pair that was way more expensive. The cord has almost like a shoelace texture to it, and feels less likely to tangle up than a standard rubber cord. They have a microphone that I haven’t tested yet so can’t comment on that. They also have a volume control, which I have used and can say that it worked on my iPhone 5s. The headphones stayed put on my head comfortably as I roamed the house doing my chores.

My Final Verdict : I was simply looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones to wear while watching tv or to listen to music on my iPhone. I’m so glad that I found these AILIHEN C8 Headphones, which look pretty similar to beats headphones at just a fraction of the price. Now I really wasn’t expecting much from these headphones, but they actually impressed me considering the price. Awesome deal considering the price!

But when you play online you need a microphone in order to be able to communicate with other players to be able to accomplish the missions and tasks ,etc. Well they only had the regular little headphones that go in your ear before and couldn't communicate with anyone so they kept getting frustrated. Thats where i came in . I came across this headset on amazon and knew i just had to get some for them. I ordered a few different kinds but must admit that the lime green ones were the coolest ones i ordered. It was simple enough for them to be able to figure out how to use the mic . And they fold compactly so they don't take up much space. The cord was well made and made with a braided fabric material over the cord so its very durable and it was very long a lot longer than i had expected it to be . They are very good quality considering that you get them for an awesome price. Well worth the price in my opinion. Theres a lot of cushion around the ears and they cancel out excess noise well. Theres also a small about 1/2 in strip of soft material as cushion for the head to make them more comfortable for wearing them for hours at a time .They look much better in person and shine alot . My camera couldn't seem to capture that aspect of them. Sorry about that. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It did not in anyway change my opinion on the product. This is simply my own personal experience while testing out the product. This discount does not affect whether or not i give a good or bad review in any way .

These headphones are comfy to wear, block out a lot of outside sounds, and don't overheat your ears. I wore them for hours on end, listening to jazz while reading on the beach.

Controls: 3/5
This headset has a mechanical slider for volume control. To my surprise, it never got accidentally nudged all week. It's stiff enough not to shift just from moving around. I can't say what happens if you take these jogging, but when I mow the lawn next weekend, I'll see if that causes the slider to shift. It doesn't adjust the volume on my phone - just the headset. That has its pros and cons, but mostly cons.

Sound Quality: 2.5/5
The sound is a bit tinny, and there's not a lot of bass. It's noticeably low-end. By contrast, I used it for audiobooks, and the mid-range clarity was very good. Also, the cushions isolate the sound very well, so you get less outside interference. That's a pro. If your top priority is sound quality, go with something pricier / higher end.

Appearance: 5/5
These look pretty slick. I'm not a fashion guru, but I like the look.

Convenience/Folding: 5/5
I have 3 sets of folding headphones, and these are the best. They don't fold super small (not like jeans pocket small) but you could stow them in a large purse, or in my case, a beach bag, easily. They are quick and easy to fold, unlike the Skullcandy ones I have.

Durability: 5/5
These stood up to high winds, sand, and wet hair pretty well. They were kicked around by a toddler, baby, and preschooler. They were shoved in an over-packed car twice and made it out alive. They took a beating and were unfazed. They FEEL pretty tough, too.

9,Was this review helpful to you?, June 4 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the black/orange version of these headphones as a surprise gift for my young adult daughter. I knew she was in need of new ear buds or headphones and because this set also features a microphone and can answer phone calls I knew she would really appreciate it. I was right! She absolutely loves these headphones! The sound quality and clarity when making or taking phone calls is actually pretty impressive.

These have a really sleek, modern design. The cable is braided and seems to be of high quality. I actually purchased a similar set of headphones around this same price point for my son at the same time as I purchased these, the only difference being that his doesn't feature the microphone and volume control. After trying them both, this pair of headphones definitely edges out the other we purchased in comfort and overall sound quality. These also do a better job of blocking outside noise. I appreciate that they fold up nicely, which is great for transporting, packing, and on-the-go.

Overall, this is a pretty great little set of headphones. Audio quality is impressive and they are super comfortable. My son always needs to ""give his ears a break"" after wearing his similar headphones for a couple of hours, but my daughter doesn't with these as the fit and padding is better.

Inside the box are a nice looking pair of headphones. I received the neon green ones .What I like a lot about these headphones is one wire controls both speakers and the wire is braided so it’s less likely to tangle up .The speakers are adjustable to about 1 ½ inches and have a thick padding to cover your ears The headphones have a rotating and folding design which makes storing or carrying around a little easier.These headphones deliver a clear hifi sound with a strong bass and block out noise that's around you, I personally listen to hard rock and rap music and the bass delivers to my standards and for my obligation to test and write a honest review I listened to some classical and easy listening music and you can hear every instrument clear and precise .Finally I plugged into my computer tower to play some games and the headphones did not disappoint me, the AILIHEN C8 stereo headphones sound very good with the volume on low or turned up. I was very impressed and plan to purchase a pair for my daughter. My final though is, these headphones are average size but comfortable and they are collapsiblie with a single nylon wire which I like, and for around $20.00 you are getting a good deal .",CRISP SOUND WITH DEEP BASS
1,Was this review helpful to you?, June 7 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These AILIHEN C8 headphones can play your music LOUD! I found myself quickly turning the sound on my computer down from where I normally have it when using my ear buds.

The padding is very nice, and the fit on my head is snug. I personally would like it to be looser, I want to feel like there is nothing on my head, but I may be asking for too much there. The snug fit allows this set to work for children as young as a tween, up to men with moderate sized heads. They do stretch quiet wide if needed, but the length might of how far the ear pieces come down may not work for a very large head. On my head, which I hope is moderate, it fits fine and snugly and still has a small amount of slide left in how much lower the ear piece could go down.

Really everything about these headphones, aside from wanting them looser, is just awesome. I hope it helps you decide if these are what you are looking for.

I will update this review should I experience any problems. I am pleased with these overall so far. That being said, I am only using them to listen to shows I watch on my Kindle Fire. So as far as actual sound quality goes, I can't really attest to that. The one con that I did notice immediately that could be a huge issue for some people is that these headphones are not at all adjustable. Originally, I thought my 7 y/o might be able to use them with the school's iPad, but they'd be too big to stay on her head. I do notice less sound coming from the right side, but I've noticed that with other headphones as well, and am unsure if they're supposed to be that way or if I have a hearing problem. I really like how these headphones fold up when not in use; however, they are still bulky. I don't expect them to last for very long as it is obvious they are of a cheaper quality. I do feel that the listed price for these headphones is too high. I don't think they should cost more than $10. They also don't come with instructions, but they arrive boxed up very well.",I am pleased with these overall so far

I listen to ASMR videos on YouTube every night as I'm falling asleep so trust me when I say they are super comfortable. More than half the time, I wake up listening to nothing but leave the headphones on because it's comforting to me. I know that's a tad weird but hey, whatever works right? The padding on the ears is great and I wipe them down with just a tad of Purell once a week just to keep them nice a clean.

The sound is great and I like that I can adjust them on the headphones themselves as well as whatever device I'm using. I have the headphones turned all the way up and then adjust the volume on my device. I've used these while on the phone with my husband and he says my voice is more clear when using the microphone on these headphones.

I didn't pay attention when I purchased these so I was happily surprised when I saw that it had a braided cord! My old head phones got trashed because the wires and little bits of fuzz were starting to poke out of the cord. This won't happen with these!!

I ordered the grey and teal color. The color is beautiful and just as pictured. They are super cute!

When my hair is up in a bun I can extend them a bit and they still fit great. I wouldn't say this size is for toddlers but older kids maybe 10 and up will have no problem wearing them.

The folding feature is cool and will come in handy for a big move we have coming up. When folded they fit nicely in the car door or even my purse.

6,Was this review helpful to you?, May 30 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,First off I love the color orange so 1 point right off the bat. ALIHEN folding stereo headset headphones work wonders when you want the full head phone experience on the go. I ordered these specifically because I seen that they were a folding headset and there were many times that I wanted to take my larger headphones with me where I was going but decided against it because they were too bulky to carry around. The ones I ordered were in blue and I was very happy with the design and look of the headphones. They seems to be well made and not cheap and easily breakable which I was happy with. They are partially plastic and partially metal and it gives them a very cool look. One thing that really impressed me was the fact that the cord was very strong and had a cloth covering over it instead of the normal plastic or rubber coating. This makes them much more durable and I like that because I am very rough with the things I use. The sound is awesome there is complaints about that and the microphone also works just as well. Overall I couldn't find 1 bad thing about these so I gave it a 5 out 5 . Disclaimer: I purchased these orange headphones with a promotional voucher for a fair and unbiased opinion.

PRO'S:
- Product arrived in timely manner
- Design of product is nice. Colors are bright and vibrant.
- Cord is hidden within the extension of the headband for the most part.
- Extension of headphones are adequate.
- Cord is of almost shoelace material, providing unique but pleasant texture and support over strenuous wear and tear use vs other cord materials.

CON'S:
- Sound leakage: This product has terrible sound conditioning. Any bystander can easily hear what you are listening if volume is at a high level. Even with headphones on head, the sound can still be heard and nice loud volumes. User must turn down music to really escape any sound leakage, but that defies the point of listening to a headset with music/gaming.

- Material: While the headband is cushioned for mitigating any discomfort, the product gets extremely uncomfortable after long duration. Tried for 2 hours and ears were hot, and sore afterwards. Extremely uncomfortable to wear.

- Sound: Bass is terrible, even at loud volumes, sound is extremely hollow and faint. Mixed music produced same results.",Product is nice looking but sound/comfort is a no

This is a really nice pair of headphones that are working really well for me and my family. They produce some pretty great sounds that are very clear with no static or hissing even when turned all the way up. They are made well and the cable is nice and thick and attached to the earbuds really well. I have no problem plugging the 3.5 mm jack into my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my wife's iPhone 6, even with a case on. They fit my ears nice and are comfortable to wear even for long periods of time without causing any types of ear aches or pains. It has inline controls for playing or pausing the music. The headphones also fold up so they are easy to store or travel with. Love these headphones.

I am a fan of the mid sized over ear headphones. These fold down for storage and have a nice braided cord with an in line volume control and a single button that functions as your home button on an I phone but also plays/pauses and answers calls. There is an in line mic as well that has decent audio quality as well. I appreciate the low profile 3.5 jack that fits around cell phone cases. Sound wise these work out well with clear highs, appropriate mids and, tight punchy lows. The low lows are not completely there but overall the soundscape works well. These wear comfortably. I will be using these for my kids tablets mostly. I hate having to mess with Bluetooth pairing for them and the cords just work.
I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them.I got the Lime Green and Grey colored headphones and they match the online pictures perfectly in color and design.

I had several pairs of Sony earbuds found in store for $8 that are super comfortable and have decent sound, but they were dropped and broke. So I was in need of a good inexpensive pair for Netflix and Pandora. I got this pair for $9.99, so I thought it was a great deal. They look adorable. They seem good quality.

I love the color and I have to admit that it was a deciding factor, since I love anything teal. I bought the mint/grey ones, but they are not mint. They are teal. I think they got color names a bit mixed up. Anyway, I love the color. The biggest issue is they are extremely uncomfortable. I cannot even wear them for 30 minutes without my ears hurting really, really bad. I do not have huge ears or a big head. I am petite and proportionate, so I don't know what the problem is. It seems to me that they might be designed for children. If the headset was slightly bigger, it would probably be comfortable.

The cord covering not being plastic or silicone coated is great because it doesn't get wrapped around itself and tangled up so easily. The microphone works well and I was able to hear him clearly when we did a test video call. The volume adjuster on the mic piece is nice to quickly adjust. They fit well and are comfortable for him.

Sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, as well as very comfortable. Noise cancellation is well above average. When headphones are on, you cannot hear anything but what is played through the speakers. As well, when the sound is up inside the headphones, those around cannot hear in the same room unless you are sitting literally right beside them and that is with them up quite loud. They are adjustable. The cord has a mic on it so that you can answer your cell phone when listening to music on your phone. They go up, maybe a little too loud, as my son could potentially do damage to his eardrums. The bass is fantastic, the clarity is phenomenal, and the treble is perfect with great balance. The mids are good, the lows are good, and the highs are good. I literally have nothing bad to say about these headphones. I have ordered three different pair this week of over the ear headphones for under $30 and these are by far the best ones. I just cannot say enough about the sound quality. Even when speaking normally during a phone conversation, my voice is not muffled and neither is the caller on the other end. You definitely cannot go wrong with these headphones. Although I received a discount for my review of this product, I, as many other Amazon shoppers, rely heavily on the un-biased opinions of other reviewers. This review is an un-biased, 100% accurate review of my personal experience with this product.",Quality is amazing. Well built and of great durability

The pros are they work like headphones should and the sound quality isn't bad for $20.00. It's mostly mids, but it's tolerable. The cons are they are made from cheap materials and a possible fire hazard. I assume many products are made cheaply and sold for more, but when it's obvious the materials are cheap it makes one nervous (light plastic). Especially since the poorly translated English warnings mention possible fire (when plugged into a phone adapter on airplanes). So uh...I won't be plugging these in to my phone anytime soon or taking them on airplanes, but I'll keep them as a throw away pair until I can afford something better.

EDIT: I changed my review to 2 stars because they are now BROKEN after 2 months. I've barely used them and the sound has gone out in the right side. I can't even return them now. You get what you pay for, but it's not worth the risk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",They're Okay

I got these for my ten year old daughter who likes to listen to music and is a novice gamer. When she first spotted the headphones right out of the box, she loved the bright, fun colors; but then she put them on and she really fell in love! She loves how comfortable they are, and more importantly how they muffle the background noise of her siblings so that she can enjoy her music and gaming experiences without the sounds of toddlers interrupting her. She also likes how easily the menu bar on the cable operates; she notes that its simple, easy to reach, and allows for all the functions she needs to access whether its pausing her music, answering her phone or skipping ahead to her favorite song. I love that her music helps her focus and that she has been able to work more efficiently on her homework when she's not distracted by outside racket! I also love that the headphones fold to store away easily in their box!
Important to note: these headphones fit really great on my daughter, but when I tried them on, they felt a little small on my ears. I highly recommend for younger (teen - pre-teen) / smaller folks but would buy something larger for myself. The headphones do cover my whole ear, but I personally prefer the kind that encase my ears completely.

These headphones are beautiful and seem sturdily constructed, as far as the body goes. That is where the positive aspects end. They do not work for someone with a big head. They are too snug. Even worse they pinch my ears terribly. I have pretty small ears maybe even smaller than most adult women and though the ear pieces are very padded they pinch badly, especially if I am wearing glasses. This is not due to the band size but something in the ear cups construction. Now the review gets worse... The sound initially was very muffled and quiet, I noticed the only way to get these things sounding reasonably loud enough was to hold down the talk button or at-least I am assuming that is what the little knobby button is as its unlabeled. Then the sound was clear. But the button does not stay depressed so you either have to hold it or find a way to gently secure it... So you can hear your audio, their sole function. I should have returned these off the bat because of the discomfort issue but I didn't, now they have forced my hand and they will go to the great dumpster in the sky. Both speakers have gone out, I struggled with one side working for about a week and today the remaining speaker has died.

This is a step above the standard Google Cardboard, in the same class as SamsungVR. If you aren't aware of Google Cardboard it is a neat little gadget that takes the price of the VR experience down from $800-$1,000 to a manageable price for a non-essential gadget. While this was on the way I thought it would take a long setup time and be cumbersome and require special hardware to run properly that I didn't have. Turns out nearly any phone can run this and setup is as easy as scanning a QR code and downloading the app. In the future I see VR playing a role in education and instruction as it allows you to get up close and personal with historical events, animals, planets, in a way you may never have been able to before.","Better than cardboard,"

I do have smaller ears and they are sensitive so I really needed something other than earbuds as they tend to make my ears ache. I also get headaches really easy from wearing anything like headbands or snug sunglasses and these haven't caused any problems. They aren't tight but don't flop off my head either. The sound quality is good. Decent bass and the volume can be turned up very loud. No issues with outside noise or having to turn it up in loud areas. I can't even turn it all the way up or it's too loud. They have a real nice look to them as well. I really like the volume control. The mic works great for phone calls. Very good product!,Great headphones for the price

2,Was this review helpful to you?, May 25 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are HEADPHONES. The manufacturer wanted you to be sure you knew, as the word is printed in large letters on the top of the headband as well as on each earpiece. Just in case you were confused... The padding on the headband and earpieces suggested a comfortable fit but they were very tight on me (I do have a large head, this is an issue I've had with some other headphones.) The cushions provide reasonable sound isolation.

The sound quality I found rather poor. Distortion was evident at even modest volumes and there was no bass to speak of. There is an inline microphone, but your voice will sound hollow and distant if you use it. Interestingly, the module with the microphone has a slide control for volume rather than up and down buttons. There is a single button that has multiple functions depending on how many times you press it - I don't like this as much as two-button models.

8,40 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, June 5 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"[AESTHETICS & FIT] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★
I ordered the color Color: Grey/Mint. The earpads have too much yellow in them so these look dirty. I would say the color is more accurately described as seaweed. One of the earpads, out of the box, has a split stitch. I suspect the rest of the stitching will be affected by this one broken stitch over time. The material around the outside of the earpads is painted to look metal but it's plastic. The headband is adjustable and comfortable to me. I don't feel too much pressure on my head or ears and I have a fairly big head.

[SOUND QUALITY] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
The instrumentals have good surround sound quality. The vocals are clear and only low-quality music has audio trailing or echoing in these headphones. (Self-produced YouTube artists have lower production quality and it's easily picked up in these headphones.) I was satisfied with the acoustics, vocals, and instrumentals.

[BASS] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★
The bass is flat. It's not non-existent but it's not seismic. The lack of bass is distracting to me, personally, because I enjoy a rich seismic bass. My ears are looking for that quality, and it affects my ability to enjoy the music.

[NOISE CANCELLING & BLEEDING] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
Noise cancelling in these is as good as can expected for the price. The louder you play the audio the better it conceals outside noises. The earpads don't appear to buffer out much themselves. There's no noise bleeding, though, which is important if you're listening to music around others.

[CONTROLS] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
These have inline control but there's little functionality. There's nothing to pause, play or skip music. There's a volume slider but it's really hard to control. As in, it adjusts the volume too much with little in between. I prefer to use my device's volume control. As is, I have no use for the controls. I typically don't like braided cords because they create transfer noise while I workout. This cord, however, is the exception to that. I can workout without hearing the movement of the cord through the headphones.

[SUMMARY] Overall Rating (Out of five stars): 18 out 25 Stars *3.6* Star Average ★★★
For the price, these are okay. If you're an audiophile or have discerning taste, I wouldn't recommend these. These are best for kids, tweens, teenagers, and any adult looking for a cheap solution. This won't break the bank if you lose or break them. They work well enough to do the job but don't offer a high-quality music experience.

BUT, these are nice headphones for the price. They have their own volume slider, and can get pretty loud. They may not have noise cancelling, but when you have the music on, I seriously couldn't hear anyone talking around me, so to me that was good enough. They fold nicely, and have a satisfying click when they fold up, but aren't crazy hard to close either. All in all they are great headphones.",Great for the cost

Was this review helpful to you?, April 30 2017,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these for a few weeks now and I love them. They are by no means high quality in terms of sound, the headphones themselves or the microphone, but for the price they are exactly what I was expecting and work well for me. I just wanted a pair of decent headphones that would have similar quality as my $10 earbuds but not hurt my ears (or my wallet) and these deliver. Plus I really like the way they look.

It seems that after some use, the mechanism that snaps the band into place when unfolding is not as strong as it was when I first got them. Sometimes if I'm just holding them and move a certain way, they will start to fold again. Could just be some rough housing on my part. Either way, folding and unfolding still works just fine.

I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking for a cheap but usable set of headphones. Obviously, if high quality sound is what you're looking for, you shouldn't even be reading this page. If all you're looking for is something that doesn't sound completely garbage and is affordable, then these are probably the headphones for you.","For cheap headphones, these are great."

The only problem is the size of the ear cushions. They cover all of your ear but they do a little pressure over them since they rest on top of the ear ...so every couple of hours I have to take them off for a while to give my ears a rest because they hurt a bit. :(

They are NOT noise cancelling headphones, but they help to muffle outside noise. I bought them to help me cope with a construction that has been going on outside my house and when I put music in decent levels (I don't like high volumes), it covers up most of the noises! I still hear very sharp/loud noises but they are very hard to muffle.

The sound quality is clear and good! I really like them! I've had no problem with sound quality. The volume control works perfectly well and is a bit sensitive which gives you a good range of volumes. I haven't tried the microphone yet, but I'll write an update as soon as I try it.

I would definitely recommend them for a good on-budget buy! Very good value for $20. It kind of exceeded expectations, except for the ear cushions which are a bit uncomfortable.",Very pleased!

Changing him to a different bus is not an option and it was suggested for him to use headphones with his phone on the bus. These headphones have done the job we needed for them to do.

The black and orange color looks great. The photo you see is a great representation of the colors that you get. The sound quality is very clear and very bright.

I have an LG L90 phone which is an old phone but I cannot go to the next track it will only let me pause not a big deal. The earpieces swivel up and down so that they sit flat around your ears very comfortable. The folding ear cups is a great space saving feature Works quite nice.
Cons: not enough bass or bottom end. When you have the headphones on there is not quite enough pressure to create a tighter seal around the ears to give a fuller bottom end to the sound. For me this was an easy fix.headphones collapse to fold all you need to do is shove a small wedge in the Gap to keep them from opening all the way you can still collapse um but the wedge prevents them from opening which creates a tight seal around the ear giving you a fuller sound and more Bass. I just cut a piece of velcro put it in the slot now there's plenty of pressure around my ears to keep them tight so I get that full sound and full Bass.",don't expect tons of Bass.

For the price, these are pretty great. They are comfortable to wear, have adjustable ear pieces (for bigger/smaller heads), the cord is amazing because of its shoelace-like durable nature, and the color (teal) is poppin'.

If you like an emphasis on bass and are not too picky about the rest of the dynamic range, these headphones would probably be fine for you. They folded into a compact size and were soft on the ear. Also, the noise cancelling feature works well, and I loved the aqua color, stylish look.

3,22 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, May 21 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am pretty OCD when it comes to overhead headphones, I have about 20 pairs, maybe more. The two biggest issues I find, not concerning the sound, are usually the cord, it's either too short or it just breaks over time causing buzz and other problems, and the size of the headphones themselves. Even ones you can extend tend to be too small for a guy with larger head, especially ones that come in all kinds of funky colors. That said, this product is very well priced and there are several other reasons why it deserves good rating:

PROS:
- price! These are cheaper than 90% of the other ones that I have, currently priced at 19.99
- modern, original design
- adjustable band, will fit a child as well as a grown up (however if you are a man and have a larger head, these may be slightly uncomfortable for you, with the band pushing on top of your head)
- good sound, its not perfect but keeping the price in mind, i believe its about a 4/5
- comfortable padding
- smaller earpads, this could be both a pro and a con, depending on what you prefer
- volume button on the cord
- built in mic on the cord
- you can fold them up for easier storage
- great noise isolation
- the cord is woven, not coated in rubber. those tend to last longer plus it also looks way better

CONS:
- personally i prefer larger earpads, this depends on personal preference
- the cord isnt detachable, could break over time and you cannot replace it
- even though you can extend the band, it may be too small for a person with larger head
- quite some noise bleed (other people will hear what youre listening to when youre using them)

MEASUREMENTS:
headband: 1.25"" wide on top
earpads/speakers: 3"" in diameter

Sound wise these are very good, the bass is about 4.5/5, pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to headphones in this price range, I was surprised at how balanced it sounded. The noise reduction is great, when you have them on, you dont hear sounds from your surroundings (which could be dangerous if you're walking or riding a bike in traffic, so be careful ;) such as tv, radio, people talking etc.

My favorite part is the design, the silver details on the side are very cool. overall I like them, you do get a Great value for your money plus the item comes well packaged in a box.",Good sound on a budget

Very modern and chic looking. Reason it gets only 2 stars? First, the ear muff parts are kind of small for adult ears. Second, with a normal bass level, you could HEAR the speakers struggling. These things are cheap for a reason. Third, and the biggest reason; it says in the description that it controls ""ipod, iphone and ipad."" This DID NOT control my ipod. Theres no comprehensive list of what models they do work with, but the manual says, ""some models not compatible."" I wish they would tell you what those models are, instead of just saying they control ""ipod, iphone and ipad."" So, 3 minutes out of the box, they are getting returned. Still, they look nice.",Contact the company to find out what models these work with. They DO NOT control my ipod shuffle.

Was this review helpful to you?, May 17 2016,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them. This is my honest opinion.",They sound good and look great.
