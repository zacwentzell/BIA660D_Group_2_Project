,AILIHEN C8 Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control Folding Lightweight Headset for Cellphones Tablets Smartphones Laptop Computer PC Mp3/4 (Grey/Mint)
0,"I really debated to get this or not but after reading mostly good reviews I decided why not and bought a pair for the holidays for my tween- Just stopped working 2 months in -crickets that's what you hear nothing, nada, zip - Not to mention that the silver is really painted plastic not really metal! What's most upsetting is that my daughter really loved these and well now all I can do is warn other parents. Don't do what I did-instead spend a bit more for a better known brand that won't do this! Absolutely disappointed! I'm hoping amazon rectifies this as I bought 2 of the same brand different style and both stopped working within a week from each other :/"
1,This product is absolutely fabulous my daughter can talk on her tablet with face time and you can hear her clearly. The sound is crisp the headphones adjust to her head and stay on snuggly. It has a long battery life as well she played for hours and it never shut off on her. The only downside is that I wear glasses so when I use these I can't wear them for too long or my ears hurt from my frames. Overall very happy.
2,"This head phone set is exactly what I have been searching for. My job requires a lot of phone calls and these work great for that. When I get a phone call, I put this head set on, and then place my I phone in my short pocket, and I can move to get files, make copies and even stack fire wood. The head set fits well and is very comfortable. By covering both ears, I am not distracted from the caller. Also the volume works really good. It actually will hurt your ears if you do not turn it down quick enough on certain calls."
3,"Another case of the buyer not understanding the technology, I guess. I bought these for my daughter who posts videos on YouTube a lot and is not happy with her microphone setup. So when she asked for headphones, and I found these that are described as having a built-in mic, and are compatible with phones and PCs, I thought this was the perfect thing. However, the mic part seems to be only activated when used with a phone, and not possible with a PC. I haven't found anything on the net that explains how to use the mic with a PC and would love feedback from any viewers if they have found the info. Also, the ear pieces seem uncomfortable for my large head. The pressure is too tight and the pieces are too small. I enjoy using Sony professional headphones for work. My 11 year old hasn't complained about their size, though."
4,"The sound quality on these headphones is terrible. The earbuds that came with my iPhone have sound quality a million times better than these headphones... 30 seconds of listening and I knew I was going to need to return them. Also the volume control doesn't actually adjust the volume on your device, only raises or lowers on top of the volume you've already set on the device. I had to crank the volume way up on my phone and increase the volume on the headphones to reach the level I usually use with my other headphones.

I knew at $20 sound quality was going to be a gamble, but the other positive reviews convinced me to try them. Now I'm out the return shipping, so learn from my mistake and pick some higher quality/more expensive headphones if sound quality is important to you."
5,"The structure of the headset is tough and durable. Not too find that it is wired since they were for my young son who doesn't keep still very well. The cord is long enough but personally think it could be a little longer to give more freedom for movement. The earcuffs are a good size as well. The volume is not as loud as I would like but as I said before, theyh are for a found child so that is not all bad. They seem more appealing for kids rather than asuults but either one could use them."
6,"These are stylish and have exactly the audio quality you'd expect. Unfortunately, due to a bit of a cable tangle yank situation, the tip of the headphone jack freely dislodged itself from the rest of the jack... directly into my phone. You would not believe how much trouble it is to get just the tip of an audio plug out of a phone, and how many problems it creates when your phone thinks a headphone is there that really isn't. Bummer!"
7,Bought these for my children for school. The price was good and didn't expect much in the quality category but was pleasantly surprised. We're good out of the box and they have held up good thus far. Would recommend these if your not looking for high end headphones with a high price. Sound quality is average but for ththe price you can't beet them
8,"Higher quality than I expected for under $20. Sound is acceptable. Bass and low notes not great, but if you are listening on a computer to higher quality audio, you can still enjoy it. This isn't what a huge audiophile would use daily, but someone who just wants to Netflix binge without waking kids, this is a great choice. The build quality is surprisingly solid, with a braided reinforced cord. Microphone and volume control slider built into cord work just fine. Probably would be the most comfortable for someone with small ears, as the ear pads and cups are small on the small side. Again, overall a better product than I expected for the price."
9,"I was really excited about these headphones. They're comfortable and cute. However they do have some drawbacks. My hair frequently gets caught in the hinges or pulled by the rubber lining, which is annoying but not a huge deal.

The headphone plug is fragile. I've had these for about two months but already the wires inside the plug are showing signs of wear, to the point where I have to frequently adjust the plug or press on the cord to get full sound. I normally keep these at the top of my backpack or tote bag, and thought I was taking good care of them, especially in contrast to my old iPhone headphones, which I frequently abused and would last a year or two before breaking down.

If you're only planning to use these at your office desk and never unplug them or take them anywhere I'm sure they'll hold on fine (although the super long cord may get annoying). But if you're always on the go like me, spring for headphones that are more durable."
0,"Not much bass, but what can you expect for under $20? I was pleasantly surprised that the sound was clear and the headphones comfortable. Honestly I was expecting to have to throw these out but based on the good reviews I was willing to give them a whirl.

I use them for a very long ferry and bus commute to and from work (you really don't want to do that with expensive earphones, trust me!). These serve their porpoise of making it clear I'm busy so I get left alone ;) but they also really do have decent sound. Not awesome sound, but far better than I anticipated considering the price.

I would definitely recommend these if you need a pair you aren't afraid to knock around a little bit. And to that point, it's been a month or so and there is literally nothing damaged on these either, so I suspect their durability will prove to be impressive as well!"
1,"I have never had much luck buying headphones for my wife. Over the years I must have bought her probably 6 different pairs and in almost 3/4 of those I ended up taking them back or keeping them for myself. They were too big, too tight, they were ugly. So, I thought I'd try again as this is what she still wants and now two weeks later is using them and I haven't heard a complaint yet. I really hope they last, but only time will tell."
2,"These are good sounding headphones. Not just for the price, but actually sound pretty good. I got them for my son, and out of curiosity tried them out for myself. Now, they don't sound quite as good as my Sony studio monitors, or my wife's Beats Studios, but they are pretty close. No idea how durable they are, time will tell as my 7 year old uses and abuses them. I'll be happy to get a year out of them for $20."
3,"I bought these headphones for my son's 8th birthday and he has worn then nonstop, he loves them! After trying them out myself, the cushioning is extremely comfortable for extended wear and the cord seems pretty durable. I do notice that the collapsible feature of these headphones might be a little TOO easy to fold, but they do not affect performance and does not bother my son at all!"
4,"This is my second pair of this brand of headphones, I've purchased another color of the same type. Their excellent for the price, my kids live them, and their pretty durable. Volume is excellent, which my kids really like. For the money, you simply can't go wrong, plus there's a good variety of colors and their customer service is great, I've already received a email asking if I enjoy them, you'll love them!"
5,"Edit: totally forgot to update this. After the trouble I had with my first pair the seller/company contacted me. Asked me a couple of questions and replaced the product. This second item has been functioning ever since without any problems.
They were great at first but after getting knocked off my head a couple times there's s loose wire and the right ear goes on an off. Didn't hit the ground just got the wires yanked I guess."
6,"First of all this is a $20 headphone so don‚Äôt expect too much!! Sooo, for the $ it‚Äôs a fair deal, sound quality is ok not great but not horrible either.. build quality is fine it‚Äôs not solid, platicy feel but they built it good. Mic work excellent on phone calls, loud and clear at least the one I got. Earpads/foam is on the medium side so if you have a bigüëÇ or head like mine this will sit on the ear. It‚Äôs soft though so it‚Äôs üëç.. Bought it for my niece so the will be perfect for her. Is it durable?? Idk yet, time will tell.."
7,"Four starts because the headphones themselves are gorgeous - I've gotten several compliments on the color scheme and folding mechanism. -1 star because the sound quality of the music seems a little tinny or underwater sometimes - it seems to be dependent on the volume and type of music. Also, the volume adjusting mechanism on the headset cord is very strange; there aren't separate buttons for + and - like there are on most other headsets. You have to use the switcher to toggle from + or -, then the button will affect whichever volume selection you're toggled to. Photo for clarity.

For <$20, I think this is a solid pair of headphones. If you're looking for outstanding quality in music, look elsewhere, but these get the job done!"
8,"Overall I would buy again. The cable that connects to the headphones is fixed and not replaceable, It broke within a few weeks of use so I threw them away and wrote it off as a bad buy. When I saw there was a quality guarantee, i wrote to the seller and they were great about replacing them. Customer service like that goes a long way to building loyalty and trust, My kid now has a new pair and I told her to be very very careful with the cable!"
9,"Bought these for our son for Christmas. He loves them, and the sound is great. Update: Had a problem with these headphones after about 2 months. They stopped working. Contacted the company regarding the warranty on them. The warranty is for 1 year after purchase. The company Rep. was very rapid and courteous in responding. After describing the problem to the rep. They said they were sending another pair at no charge. No hassles, courteous rep. 1 yr. warranty. How can you beat that ? Very pleased with the product and company. Thanks for a great product aith a great warranty."
0,"at first I really enjoyed them... they work perfect for TV and podcasts. for music, the are pretty good too. everyone says they can hear me really clearly on the microphone when connected to my phone.

A month later, I can only hear from one ear piece unless I wiggle the cord. I was not harsh on them so I feel that maybe the quality could be better."
1,"These are nice-looking headphones with good sound for the price. However, one of the ear cushions came off in less than two months of gentle use. Amazon informs me that they're ineligible for return as that's only allowed within 30 days of delivery. So yeah, that's what passes for a warranty."
2,"I was a bit skeptical about buying these headphones but they looked so good I went ahead with the purchase. I am not disappointed one bit. The sound that these things put out is amazing. You can hear the bass, the mid range and the tweeters. They are so loud that I cannot listen the volume at it's max. It's no beats or bose but for $20 it is amazing."
3,"I was getting tired of having earbuds stuck in my ear so I decided to give these headphones a try.
The fit is great and as is the sound both from the headset and the microphone. Where my wife complaining she couldn't always hear me during call she now talks about the clarity."
4,"These headphones are just about as ""OK"" as any headphones you're going to be able to buy for $20. Mine broke after about 6 months which seems like a decent run, but they just stay at my desk at work. First one side, now both sides. Unless I tilt my head in a weird way and don't move. I imagine if you're going to be using these more regularly and taking them around they would not last as long. They look pretty good for how cheaply they are probably made, but that's the best thing I can say about them."
5,What I liked the most about these head phones is that they are super comfortable. They are noise canceling and the wrapped cord is perfect. The cord is extra long so you can do whatever you need to. These are stylish. The only thing I didn't like was the silver part is plastic but it folds easily and is adjustable. You bet I'll be buying alihen again!
6,"I really liked these headphones while they lasted, but I've only had them for two months and one side randomly stopped working. I wasn't particularly rough with them and they stopped working in the middle of me using them. I'm really disappointed because they were nice headphones."
7,"I liked these headphones. They are really cute. However, I've owned them for 3 months, and the sound has started to cut out in the right speaker. The padding started to slip off the headphone about a month ago. There is a reason they are cheap.

I do use them everyday, and walk about 40 minutes a day with them on, so you may have better luck than I if you're more gentle on them than I am."
8,"After trying a bunch of headphones for the kids, these have been by far the best. They also cancel noise pretty good - my son uses them in the car to watch movies and he can't hear me playing my music over these."
9,"My daughter uses these for school. Not the absolute best sound. But they get the job done. A child doesn't need base anyway. They are better quality than most in the same price range. Would have preferred hidden wires, but you get what you pay for."
0,Broke after 1 week.
1,"We love these inexpensive headphones! My lawyer husband has three sets now and uses them for all his cell phone conference calls. They are reliable, simple and voices are very clear! We recommend!"
2,I bought these for my grandson and he loves them.
3,My daughter is very happy with them.
4,"My daughter loved these headphones until they broke. The wire on one side came lose, and now there is only sound on one side. Ugh! These only lasted about 6 weeks!"
5,"Quality sound, daughter loves the color! Great price, arrived before projected time."
6,"Great headphones, love them. And I will be ordering more of them in different colors."
7,My son got these for Christmas and after he got back to college they broke after about a week of use. I'm sad because they were so expensive and he barely got any use out of them
8,"Seemed very promising, but the quality sucks. The headphones broke with in a month. Do not buy."
9,Kid loves them. Comfortable to wear.
0,Stopped working after 3 days. Don't waste your money.

All that matters."
3,"Earphones worked great til about the 2 month mark, they started doing that annoying ""only one ear plays music"" thing..."
4,"The foam cushions came off very easily, and now the headphones are not useable. Disappointed."
5,"Arrived quickly, works well. My husband is a DJ and his headphones broke. He needed something to get him through a wedding this weekend and said these worked better than expected and he is very impressed."
6,Love these headphones! They sound great and the microphone works well with my iPhone. They are well made and fit comfortably. The color is perfect. I would definitely recommend these.

2,Granddaughter loves these
3,"I have to say I liked this product when I first got it. The packaging was nice with no damage! However these headphone did not hold up for even a month. They did live up to their standards however the wiring did break so only one side worked, but was really drowned out."
4,"Worked great for a while. After about 6 months, one ear is losing sound. I did like that I could fold the headphones and put it in a bag easily. Sound was great while it lasted."
5,The other earphones broke sound
6,They are nice headphones for a cheep price. They work well. But if you ware them for to long they do start to heart you ears
7,"Sounds great, I decided to buy another one as a gift."
8,I received my headset and it worked perfectly but after 2 weeks of use on of the speakers stop working but that what you get for a $20 headset
9,"I bought 2 pairs for my grandsons just before Christmas, the blue pair already has a bad wire and they don't work, not sure I would buy again, less than 90 days of use, not very durable!"

1,"I typically don't write reviews, but I absolutely love these headphones. They are the best pair that I have ever owned that weren't awfully expensive to purchase. I would buy them again."
2,At first we were really pleased with this product. However it has now been exactly two months since we've purchased them and they are only working in one ear. I would not waste money on these.
3,"Great product, very durable! Great quality ! Solid sound, my son is 7 very comfortable.."
4,"They worked fine. Pretty color. You may notice I used past tense. Our puppy already chewed thru the cord rendering them useless, unfortunately."
5,Great sound. Easy to use & comfortable.
6,"Pretty color. Good quality product. Cushioned ear pads are soft and very comfortable to wear for a long time. Good sound control.
Excellent product."
7,Great!!!!
8,Purchased for daughter. Pretty color. Headphones didn't even work for a full day. Printed return label and sending back. Don't waste your money or time with this product.
9,"Love the color by stopped working about a month and a half after we purchased them, now all
Sound is muffled and sounds like you're under water, would not buy again."
0,"Love the color and love that the cord feels similar to a cloth, thin, rope."
1,"My son loves these! He's 6, and they fit him perfect and they are very durable. They also fit me! I know the noise cancellation works well, since he yells at me when he has them on lol"
2,It sounds nice I haven't had a headphones way to many years. So I have nothing to compare to. I like them so far thank you. And the color is fun and bright blue that is.
3,work ok should be extra careful with cord
4,Bought these for my little sisters birthday. They arrived on time and she loves them. The color was exactly what I expected. I'm very happy especially for the value! I plan on buying a pair for myself as well.
5,"Bought for one of our children for road trips, works great with all his electronics"
6,not very loud
7,The sound is great. The volume and mic are a great length on the wire. I use these at my job all day long. Call quality is great. i can hear them clearly as they can hear me perfectly as well.
8,Son loves them.. came on time to. Great product.
9,"You get what you pay for. The material feels cheap, the audio sounded poor and the headphones where way to wide for my head. They look decent and will work if you're not looking for high quality music streaming."
0,These broke within weeks of receiving them. The metal piece that goes into the headphone jack bent. These are not good quality and I would not recommend.
1,They are great! My son especially likes the volume control on the cord.
2,Excellent product!
3,Didn't sound as good as I had hoped. Pretty color and sturdy built and I liked the volume control. However they did not sound very good. Apple headphones sound better.
4,"They broker after a couple weeks, but while they lasted they were very good. I don't personally think it was worth the money, sorry to say. Maybe invest in something a bit more expensive?"
5,Great sound. Excellent so far. The only problem which is minor is the adjustability is for adults only. Too big for my 11 year old that I bought them for. Great price so I will keep them as a back up or use them myself.
6,My daughter wanted these to use with her laptop. They are comfortable and the sound quality is good.
7,For the money they are great headphones. Very good sound reproduction qualities.
8,"Great product for the price. The only thing (for me) is I have a big head and wish the adjustment would be longer to totally secure the ears. Regardless, the product is great and my music sounds fabulous. Highly recommended."
9,"Far from sound proof of any kind, but I know they're not advertised as that. Sound is good, and they're comfortable."
0,"I've had these for about a month, I don't use them often and I take care of them... The mic has already gone bad on it. It sounds like I'm underwater.....
They look cute though?"
1,It stop working in less than a month. the connection went out as it seems the wiring has a problem near the 3.5mm jack. Could not rehab the problem and had to purchase a replacement.
2,"The headphones may look nice and be comfy, but the audio quality is absolutely horrendous. Voices sound muffled and have a grainy quality. Mid tones are lacking and high tones are nearly non-existant."
3,"Bought them for my wife and she loves them.
She like the soft feel on the ears, not hot like some full headphones but still has good clarity.
She is going to order more and send as gifts."
4,Loved the headphones. They were a little big for my son's head but he will grow into them. The sound quality was great and the quality of the headphones were great as well. All around the headphones are amazing.
5,"Great headphones for kids, well built and great sound quality."
6,Headset appears to work good. After four (4) month only sound that could be heard was static.. Music can be heard when move around but talking would be drowned out when used on laptop and cell phone.
7,"Love, love, love all of my Ailihen Headphones they have a nice clean sound."
8,Cheap
9,Good stuff as advertised.
0,"The button pressed three times does not rewind songs, but everything else works."
1,Very nice headphones and a very nice price. Amazing sounds
2,I like that the sound was very clear and headphones fit comfortable.
3,No complaints.
4,I am extremely pleased with my headphones. Amazon has never let me down so far. And I will continue shopping with them.
5,Im completely satified!
6,Haven‚Äôt had them for even 60 days and they have a short in them. So disappointed. We are out of the 30 day return window so we are out of luck on having them replaced.
7,"These work great, sound great. Love it. What a deal!!"
8,Great value for the quality. Earbuds cover so well that our son can't hear us talking to him.
9,"Product feature is good. Sound quality is commensurate to the price. However, the product is bit on heavier side and using for around 30-45 minutes makes the ears to ache."
0,"Great headphones, have to take them off to hear what ppl are saying....ALMOST sound deadening !"
1,My son loves these headphones
2,Only one side work.
3,"After about 1 month of using this product, the sound went out. Can't hear anything through the headphones anymore. I would strongly recommend NOT purchasing these headphones."
4,My daughter loves them
5,not too happy work great but the one side already has the cushion part falling off
6,"Music play is definitely better. More continuos, also better reception during bad weather."
7,They are exactly as described. Very soft cushion on ears. Daughter loves them.
8,For the price excellent head phones! From treble to thumping bass yeow!!
9,"My son purchased these for himself and he seems to love them. The sound is loud and clear. The folding option is nice as he can fold and store with ease. Good service, fast shipping. Item arrived one day early."
0,Was pleased with this product until recently. My son received these as a gift and now the interior wire has become disconnected after a couple of months and does not work on one side...
1,"The headphones were a quick replacement for headphones that quit working just prior to a family trip to Hawaii. My son was thrilled with them initially (they looked cool and worked well). Unfortunately this didn't last long. About 2 weeks after getting back from our trip (and about a month after receiving the headphones), the audio connector snapped off inside my son's kindle fire. Not only did this make his headphones unusable (cable is an integral part of the headphones), but also kept him from hearing any sound from his kindle. I ended up having to take his kindle apart to remove the broken piece. This was not any easy task, and I'm lucky I didn't destroy the kindle in the process."
2,I bought these for my daughter for school just a few weeks ago. The color is awesome and they seem pretty durable and sturdy. I'm not sure what the cord is made out of but I love it and it looks as though it will hold up nicely. My daughter is 8 and is super big for her age so these fit her really well.
3,"My son needed headphones for school.. Green is his favorite color so these were an even bigger bonus! They work well and I am not worried about him getting an ear infection from earbuds being in his backpack for a week with who knows what, since they don't go in his ear."
4,"The sound quality was good, both listening and for the person on the other end of the line. I gave this a 3 star however, because I did not find the headphones very comfortable. They pinched my ears a bit and I am looking for headphones I could wear for multiple hours. These are on-ear headphones."
5,"I ordered this headset and liked the fit and color very much. It was a lot more comfortable than headsets I had used in a similar price range. After 4 months the 3.5 mm plug connection to the phone was not working properly and the audio would fade in and out. I contacted Ailihen and they responded promptly and made some suggestions of 4 things to try to solve the problem. After trying the 4 suggestions with no improvement, they offered to send me a new headset free of charge, which they did and I had a brand new headset within several days. They were very professional and kind in their interactions. In summary, a great headset for the price and excellent customer service."
6,10 year old daughter is loving these... I'm a little jealous too. LOL. They appear to be of very good quality and have decent sound reproduction. Love the fact they're one cord only. Daughter also likes the volume control and pause button in line. She also likes the mint green color. Can't really complain.... Pirate approved.... Arrrrrrrrrrrrr!
7,"Very cute and comfortable. The sound quality is better than I expected for the price - not bass-heavy, so it's not gonna feel like Beats-style imitation headphones, but it is clean and crisp sound. Only major problem with them so far is that the sides aren't adjustable, so they are just ever so slightly too large for my head - I wouldn't be able to work out in these because they would fall off, but listening to music or watching videos they work great."
8,"I purchased this in early February. When I got it, it was great. Good sound, comfortable to wear, worth the price.
But despite taking care of it, at the end of March, the headphones started having issues. Now my left side is wonky. I have to hold the cord a right way in order for me to hear sound coming from the left. I've had cheaper headphones that worked longer than these.

If my headphones didn't have issues a month after purchase, I would give this 5 stars."
9,"light weight, great sound.
We purchased this headphone for our son who is very ""rough"" on items. It has truly helpup to all the use he has put it though. I love that they fold down for easy storage. Great purchase for children."
0,Came broken. Do not recommend.
1,"Junk! don't waste your money! bought one and it broke right away, exchanged it for a new one and that one lasted about a week."
2,You get what you pay for. Really cheap product that stopped working about two weeks after receiving it. Return window had closed by the time the left ear fully cut out.
3,"Looks good, but I don't like the volume control - it is hard to operate with it."
4,exactly the way they looked in photo and shipped fast
5,Good quality for the $$$$
6,Came quick. Works fantastic.
7,"the sound quality is surprisingly great! Very much worth it for the price, great quality."
8,"I bought 2 of these headphones, 1 blue and 1 pink and they are great, my kids love them!!!"
9,Not even a month and one speaker went out.
0,First impression wasn't so good. But after maybe two months of use I can say that these Headphones worth it! Pretty good sound and comfortable (more or less).
1,Very good
2,"i bought these on Prime Day, and am very happy with the deal i got.
i have bought 3 pairs of headphones on Amazon recently.
One broke. One didn't work well.
This is the best pair."
3,"Compact, portable and works great!"
4,great
5,"the wire connection broke after 6 weeks - that was disappointing. Prior to that, sound quality and mic quality were good."
6,"Great headphones. It doesn't completely block out background noise, however is sufficient on trains and planes."
7,"Love these headphones. Comfortable fit, great sound, good quality and received quickly."
8,Work great. Excellent service!

5,They broke within 2 months not so happy. But quality hearing.
6,Comfortable and great sound
7,Just as advertised. Got them when promised. Great quality for the price.
8,My eleven year old son likes these headphones. Comfortable to wear and they work great. Easy to store. Happy with this purchase.
9,These headphones are okay. I broke mine very easily. Plus the left side headphone stopped working after a while.
0,"The sound is great, the adjustable fit works for both a 10-year-old and a parent. They are also exceedingly comfortable."
1,My son received these for Christmas and they are working great for him! Good headphones for the money!
2,This was a gift for our daughter (9yr old). She absolutely loves them. They are comfortable & she likes the pause & volume options on the cord. Great gift option for anyone!!
3,They are for my child and she loves them! Great product. She can listen well out of them
4,"The headphones are beautiful blue-green, comfortable, really good sound, and great price (smiles)."
5,Use these at work all the time! They fit perfect and actually look like really high quality headphones
6,"My daughter really enjoyed the headphones, though her use has been limited. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks, the headphones no longer work properly. I cannot recommend them."
7,I love my Ailihen V8 Folding Headphones. They are comfortable and the long nylon cord is an invention that makes so much sense. I just bought another pair for a friend.
8,"They look nice, but I keep getting emails about doing a review so that is why a lower rating. We haven't used them yet because they are a Christmas gift."
9,"Headphones arrived quickly and worked as expected, and as described."
0,"Excellent headphones!!! Great price, too."
1,worked great for one week then crashed
2,Lasted almost a month before one side failed
3,Bulkier than expected. Usage was for sleeping so might be my mistake.
4,Good fit and comfortable.
5,The headphones arrived right on time and the quality is much better than I expected for the price. Great deal and service.
6,My granddaughter loved them. Great headphones.
7,Too early to determine.
8,"The headphones were delivered in time. I'm satisfied by the product itself, with the only downside that it starts to hurt a little when put for too long (around 45 min-1 hour for me) and even then its more a slight annoyance than a real issue."
9,Great value and terrific sound.
0,I ordered three of these all from the same manufacturer and distributor. They were all broken by the end of the first week. One of them was defective right out of the box. When I tried to email the distributor the email address no longer worked.
1,Beautiful headset clear and flexible great that I just received another pair
2,"Exactly what I needed! I wanted something that would allow me to make phone
calls from my google phone in a crowded environment with a lot of background
noise."
3,"Color , size , and softness speakers are very clear very comfortable"
4,Just what he needed.
5,Excellent product. I got it on time.
6,My son loves them. The color and fit is perfect for his head. Thank you
7,Just ok. These look cute but are not adjustable like every other headphones I've ever seen. So if your ears do not match up perfectly with the them...too bad. :(
8,Came quickly. This is my sons second pair and he specifically asked for these saying they are good.
9,I was unhappy with this item. The sound was of poor quality.. the worst problem was that the back ground music. It would overpower the audio and could not be turned down.
0,My son LOVES his head phones!! This is a great product for a GREAT price! I definitely recommend this product!! Love how comfy they are and how they fold away nicely!
1,Second purchase. first ones lasted a long time. Very well built. Can take a beating from a 16 year old!
2,"Love! They not only look great but more importantly, they sound great! Impressed with the value and comfort and would definitely recommend."
3,This was the best $9.99 I've spent in a long time. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Sound is great. Great quality.
4,I use it for my Xbox and iPad. Good sound quality but the ear phones do not turn so if you have it on for 15 min it hurts your ears. But other wise their pretty nice.
5,"My daughter loves this headphones, they have great sound and are perfect for her, she's 11."
6,"It's for my daughter- her Christmas present as she requested. It's not been opened yet, but I hope she'll love it."
7,Bought as Christmas present for Grandson. He gives them a two thumbs up rating!
8,Its functional but light weight like cheap plastic and the ear bud is small so it sits on my ears. Cheap for the price
9,They are a gift so they haven't used them yet....I am sure they will be very happy with them!!!
0,"Bought this for our 14 year old granddaughter, and the fact that she wore them a lot after receiving, is testament enough that they were worth it."
1,These are our second pair. Both pair have stopped working after a short amount of time.
2,These were of good quality. I enjoy the sound they provide as well as the nice teal/mint color. They are fairly comfortable and worth the purchase
3,"They are beautiful, great sound, and easily adjustable. I get feedback in the headphones when there isn't anything playing. It also isn't as tall as I need them and gives me a headache from the pressure on the top of my head."
4,Bought these headphones for my daughters birthday! Of course she loves them! Very nice and comfortable to wear also good quality of sound! Also the price of them isn't bad either!
5,Very happy with these headphones. Love the color and the sound is very clear
6,I liked the style the best. Least was the lacking of depth of the sound. Would give it 2.5 stars. Am actually paying for shipping to return it.
7,Good product with good quality.
8,Bought 2 pair...both have stopped working with very little use. Had one pair replaced and same thing happed. Not a good purchase.
9,Great headphones and super service
0,only one side of the headphones works.
1,"Not bad, but they don't hug my ears like other headphones that I have used in the past. They are also inclined, and in spite of adjusting the headband, to slip forward on my head if I lean over."
2,Great!
3,Product looks like the display. I enjoy my headphones not only can I listen to music but I can also talk through the mic and people have said that it sounds very clear !
4,Beautiful color and the sound is great. They are super comfortable and love that they can fold.
5,Very pleased with these headphones.
6,My daughter loves her headphones. She said they are comfortable with good volume. And she LOVES the color!!!!
7,"ok, but far from great sound was muffled compared to better headphones still in the $30 price point"
8,"My son loves the ""adult"" look and feel of these headphones. I like the volume control, so its a win for us both!"
9,Good product for use at school.
0,"These are Stereo headphones- meaning that the higher pitched sounds will be more powerful than the bass. If you're looking for bass-boosted ones, this isn't for you. They also broke within a month of using, after I was just getting used to them."
1,Awsome you cant hear any noises out side of them and the loudest voulume is louder than my phones highest volume
2,"I liked the color, also they are comfortable. But if you really enjoy sounds, this is not the best option. It‚Äôs poor quality."
3,"Had the headphones for about a month before one side gave out, and then another week before they just stopped working entirely."
4,"Love these headphones! Great sound and cool design, the only negative trait is that my pair stopped working in only a few months."
5,Great sound and durability
6,"Gift for my 8yr old, he loves them. I tried them on and they are very comfy and noise canceling."
7,"Bought 2 sets of these headphones as Christmas gifts. With occasional use, both sets have stopped working 35 days later. Would NOT recommend."
8,Love them! Lightweight good volume!
9,Headphones work flawlessly. They are vibrant and work as described. Price is great and would definitely order again!
0,"I like mine, they are soft and fit well on my ears and head. I don't get a headache when I wear them like some over the ear headphones give me. I use then a couple hours a night while doing homework and studying. Didn't block outside noise 100% but well enough that I can focus while my family watches TV in the other room."
1,"I am in love with this headphones, honestly talking I wasn't expecting much from it but it surprise me how good they are.
1st they are REALLY comfortable you barely feel that you have them on
2nd the music sound AMAZING in them the volume is perfect you can either have it loud or low with no problem
3rd and this is a plus, you don't hear your surrounding, which for me is great cause I want to listen to my music not to what the person next to me is saying
In simple words they are perfect. üëçüëçüëç"
2,"Light weight, sound quality is good (very good for gym), and construction, even though plastic, is good. The fit over the ears is acceptable but could be better. If you are looking for significant noise cancelling, these are not for you. But they do help. Overall and for the price they are worth trying. No regrets."
3,"Great seller, bad product. Bought one set, the sound went out in one ear within weeks. Seller replaced very quickly under warranty without any hassle at all. Replacement set had the same problem within a few weeks, too- sound in one ear becomes unreliable, goes in and out when the cable moves, then stops working entirely. Wiring issue? Would buy from this seller again, but not this manufacturer."
4,I really like these head phones. Got them for my 4 year old son who has a average size head and they work great. He uses them mostly for listening to movies in the car when we go on trips. I like the volume control on the wire of the head phones.
5,Bought these for my 10-year-old for Christmas this year as he was wanting Dr. Dre Beats and I was clearly not going to spend that kind of money on headphones for someone this age. These were surprisingly comfortable with decent sound and excellent noise reduction. Highly recommend these headphones at this price point. My son loves them!
6,"These headphones have great sound for the price. But after a short period of listening, they become uncomfortable and painful to the outsides of my ears. I've tried adjusting them every-which-way, with the same results. I don't have unusually large or small ears, but maybe these headphones just don't fit me correctly."
7,"Love the color! My son loved that he could control his iPad with the controls on the cord. I like how compact they fold & I do not hear his utube videos when he is laying next to me wearing them. These fit both of my boys...Bought for my almost 6 year old, but my 11 year old like to steal them too!"
8,I bought these headphones to use at work for my music streaming on my cell phone. I absolutely love them! They fit really nicely on my ears and are very lightweight. I highly recommend them.
9,"Worked less than a year & wouldn't ya know, by the time I was able to get to the return process, it was too late :/ Crazy thkng is, I bought a set for each of us & they all crashed around the same time. I guess they're supposed to only last long enough to get you past the allowable return time."
0,These are awful. They are way too big and they hurt my head and ears. They look nice and are soft to the touch.
1,These broke off in our iPad within 1 week of using. Super disappointed and a waste of money.
2,"Bought these for my daughter and she loves them! They are comfortable, a great color and have awesome features like volume control. A great price too!"
3,"Well made, adjustable, foldable...and my kiddos favorite color. Highly recommend."
4,"High quality, great sound, and no problems. 5/5, came exactly as expected."
5,1 month and both pair i purchased went out....completely nothing works on it
6,stopped working after two months
7,Perfect just what my wife wanted
8,Very good for the price. Have Beats Solo and SkullCandy Bluetooth...these perform just as well.
9,I like them very much
0,"Decent headphones for the price. I thought I was buying ""around the ear"" headphones. These are ""on ear"". Less comfortable and less sound isolation."
1,"These headphones just stopped working after a little over a month of use. One side suddenly lost sound, and the next day, the other side did as well."
2,Very nice headphones
3,These headphones were great only draw back was they were to big for one of the grandsons but other than that everything from ordering to receiving were great
4,"My kid loves these headphones. Earbuds always hurt his ears, and these are nice and comfy. We purchased a hard case so he can put them in his backpack."
5,There a little to large for my sons head and won‚Äôt answer the phone through them like he thought but for music there great
6,My grand daughter loved this item. Perfect color
7,My daughter love the look and feel of these. Sound quality is good and perfect for her needs.
8,"The headphones aren't producing any sound at all. No matter what it's plugged into, and even if I have the volume turned all the way up."
9,"I've had these for about 2 months. They work great, but the cable is already fraying. From the looks of it, I estimate the useful life of this purchase will be 6-9 months."
0,Purchased as a gift. The recipient is very pleased with it... Simple... not a lot of bells and whistles!
1,Works great so far
2,My daughter loves them!
3,sound great for the money!
4,"The product arrived without an issue. However, I cannot give a good rating when only one ear piece stops working after two weeks of intermittent use."
5,Excellent headphones
6,A great buy for the price. Good sound and nice feel and look. Foldable also
7,"Super Comfortable, Noise Canceling. Handle with care it‚Äôs super lightweight you can barely feel them on your ears. Recommend to anyone"
8,Bought these for my daughter. She absolutely loves them!
9,"These aren't very comfortable (I can only wear them for about an hour at a time). They sound okay, good enough for what I wanted and for the price."
0,Good sound but not the most comfortable!
1,Bought this for my 9 year old son. They have worked great he has had them for about 2 months no problems.
2,Returned.
3,Good product.
4,"Worked great for about a month. Then the mic and audio controls started freaking out and now they're basically useless, music stopping and starting constantly, volume adjusting on its own"
5,"This fit me great, sound quality is good, and they are cute. My husband doesn't like the fit on him. I have not tried out the microphone just yet."
6,Very happy with these headphones.
7,Great headphones
8,"Bought these for my son to use at school, good fit, love that they fold"
9,These headphones were purchased as a replacement for another brand which I had previously replaced twice for a tween. They are used a lot but with care. So far these are great and he loves them! The foldable feature is also great.
0,One of the best sounding headphones that I have owned.
1,"Got a pair for my daughter for school, Nice because they fold up . Now ordering a second pair for home!"
2,Meet my expectation
3,Fast ship. Order as described.
4,We got these for our nine year old and she loves them! Stylish and they were great.
5,Great headphones for the price.
6,Wasn't as loud as expected
7,Only had them three months and you can only hear out of one side. Have to play with the cord to get them to work correctly.
8,I'm very pleased with the. Head phones I will keep in mind if I need them again
9,"For a kid who wants beats, these suited him just fine and at a lot better price. Great sound, comfortable wear and cool look. I love that they fold up compact and can be stored in a case to protect them from damage when not being worn."
0,Christmas present for my granddaughter!! Very nice!!! She loved them!! Wonderful!!
1,I need a bigger end plug the old kind and not the new small plug.
2,"Bought them as a gift for my son. Completely satisfied Mom right here! Now he can listen to his ""music"" without the entire house or entire vehicle for that matter hearing."
3,"great quality and color, item as expected and arrived quickly"
4,"These headphones will be for my granddaughters - giving as gifts for the holidays. I do not know how
well they work - I am sure they will be great."
5,It works well and fits my ears comfortable. Sound is fine. My only quibble is it is a bit uncomfortable on the top of my head no matter how I adjust it.
6,"Great product for the price I paid! Exactly what I wanted, a cheap set of comfortable headphones with great sound quality."
7,My kids each got a pair of these for XMas and everyone loves them.
8,They dont work for long!! I am NOT impressed. Will not buy again speaker blows out on low volumes i would Give zero stars if i could.
9,"I received the product in the time as stated. They fit well, are comfortable and sound quality is great."
0,"the sound is not loud enough,even at highest volume. Also, earphones do not block out outside noise."
1,Great product. They don't block out ALL sound. But the quality is good for the price. The headphones fold up nicely and produce good sound quality.
2,My 11years old son absolutely love it! True to display picture and Shippping was quick!
3,My son love it
4,Great head phones!
5,Granddaughter had elected these for her gift - she has been using them and seems very happy with their performance.
6,"Not working after eight months light use. Don't buy it!
Received replacement, good customer service."
7,thegvcherghfbjbghhcgygfghghfhhjfhghgahgs
8,I love this though it could be a bit louder. The colors are beautiful. But anyway it is great and I suggest it to people who are looking for headphones.
9,The sound was very good and not like in a box or underwater. The wires inside the jack did not last. Now my sound cuts in and out
0,I love tbese headphones! i use them to watch my shkws on netflix and the sound quality is so good that i can hear background conversations! lol
1,"Doesn't sound incredible, but good enough for the price. We had another set that lasted about 6 months and the plug on it now needs replacing."
2,"Shipped quickly.
Headphones are great quality.
Will be buying these again because I now have to get my daughter a pair!"
3,Great üëç
4,"Good quality sound, though the cord is a little longer than what I'm used to. So far I'm very pleased with the headphones."
5,they broke within a month of me using them. totally not worth the $20. just invest in a good pair of headphones
6,Exceeded my expectations! I‚Äôm thinking of getting one for my husband too!
7,great value
8,fit good sound great for the money
9,"Shipped quickly, good headphone a little uncomfortable to wear very long"
0,Most amazing headphones they are so great! The sound is amazing and I highly recommend these headphones.
1,We bought 2 of these and both jacks Brock off inside iPads within a couple weeks. Thought the first one was our fault but after 2 fair to say...junk.
2,They lasted only a couple months before one side went out.
3,"Pretty and comfortable headphones, but poor sound quality. If you are bass lover, this headphones are not for you."
4,"Great value. Clear sound and although not rated as noise cancelling, they do block out quite a bit of sound."
5,"Nice, but broke easily"
6,"Shorted after extremely careful minimal use in less than 2 months since received. One side no longer has sound, short seem to be at the headphone jack part of the cord."
7,Great for my 8 year old. He loves them
8,This is a gift from my kids really love them they're not totally noise canceling but for the price point I think they're really great buy!!!
9,daughter loves them
0,These are really good headphones for the price they sound good and fit well the cord is stronger than most
1,"As described, teal color is nice"
2,We have bought these twice now due to our puppy chewing up the first pair... my daughter loves them though... great quality
3,Great headphones overall. However not a good choice for running/working out. I found that these headphones made me very hot
4,Very lightweight and comfortable around the ears. Haven't tried the sound yet they are for my daughter. Very fast shipping.
5,Outstanding product...works extremely well when talking on my phone...can do everything $200 plus headphones can do
6,"Fantastic product. Very comfortable, good sound. Bought them for the extra controls that work with media players on my Android phone."
7,Thx
8,I bought these for my autistic grandson for our plane ride to Disney. They not only acted as an earplug he loved them. No discomfort
9,This product is not worth the money. I've had it less than 2 weeks and the sound started to disconnect. I would not buy this again.
0,My daughter has had these for 3 months and there must be something loose because the sound coming from the left side is hit or miss. If I tilt my head to the left and keep it there then it‚Äôs all good. 3 stars because technically they still function I guess.
1,"I'm not sure what's the hype about. I guess it's the price. To me the sound is just average, I find more treble and clarity in my ear buds. For what I use them, they're fine, but I wouldn't buy another pair."
2,"Great headphones...I had a pair that were tight, but these are a good fit. I use them at the gym and they work well. They fold, a good feature for them to fit in my gym bag. They don't shut out all the sound, but that's fine. They muffle the sound of the weights being dropped by those jerks, such a jarring sound! Music sounds good through them. Thanks for a good product."
3,"I needed these for an all day nursing simulation. They were so comfortable, the audio quality was great, and everyone heard me clearly. I like that the length of the cord. It's long enough to stand up and move around."
4,"Purchased these for my teenage grandson for Christmas --- he used them for a couple hours yesterday and several hours today --- he loves them. They appear to be very good quality and he said the ""fit"" is perfect."
5," Love these headphones so much! Honestly I was afraid to get these becaus of the price but to my suprise they are absolutely amazing. The sound is very nice and clear, and as the volume goes, it goes pretty high. I love the way it sounds and especially the look of it. I got the tourqiouse color and im ipressed with how it looks. I read other reviews on how they didnt like it but im very pleased and recommend this product. I dont have anything bad to say about this. I even like how its foldable for on the go."
6,"Bought as an Easter gift for my 9 year old. In limited use (2-3 times per week) and they are already unusable. Were good at first with solid noise cancelling ability but as of this writing in June (about 2 months) they barely play sound and its mostly muffled and broken up. Tested on several devices to ensure its headphones and unfortunately, it is. Not good quality. Do not recommend to buy at all, they don't last and you will be disappointed."
7,"They are great headphones. Love that they fold up too! I even ordered a pair for my son and he loves them too.
My favorite part is the volume on the cord. and the string is not a typical plastic covered wire, which makes working out with them even better. They don't get caught on anything and the cord doesn't tangle up either."
8,"I bought two pairs of these for my tween sons and have to say that they were one of the best purchases for the holiday so far! The headphones are not only comfortable and cleverly designed, but they were within an affordable price range. I imagine most parents with teenagers will appreciate this due to the incredible number of expensive headphones/earbuds/etc. we've purchased that have either gotten lost, broken, or flat out disappeared into thin air. Thanks, AILIHEN team for designing headphones with my kids in mind! Cheers!"
9,"Love the color of these headphones. They are a little tight after wearing for an hour but this is only a slight nuisance. These are not noise canceling but they do a pretty good job. I sometimes wear them at work, even when I am not listening to anything, to drown out colleagues talking. I like that the cord is not plastic. Definitely recommend."
0,Fast delivery. My 14 year old is in love
1,My daughter really enjoys them.
2,Just what I expected very good little loose around the heirs sound sound quality is great
3,Well made and very comfy!
4,From the moment they came out of the box they never worked so I sent them back and bought a different pair from another company.
5,This was kinda bad the sound basiclly go all screatchy after 1 week worst head set every bought
6,Tha cord is a little too long for my taste but otherwise they feel great!
7,"Purchased for my boys for Easter (purchased two). They seem to love them, have used them every day since. So far (less than a week since use started though), no issues."
8,"Very happy so far. Way better than earbuds for watching movies on my tablet, but way more reasonable than some of the ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù brands!"
9,The Microphone part of the headphones quickly broke and left them with only listening aspect. besides that they're good.
0,Good quality Great sound Great price Would recomend
1,"awesome ,love them"
2,These headphones have already stopped working. I am returning them today. I've only used them a couple of times. What a disappointment.
3,"Bought this for my son, he loves them!"
4,"Terrible product. Initially we loved them, but they stopped working after less than two months of light use! I would not recommend these headphones."
5,They lasted about 3 weeks.
6,100% satisfied
7,Did not work 2 weeks after we got them.
8,"This was a gift for my daughter, she likes them very much and so far they are working well."
9,Very cute. Soft cushions. Does not connect well to my iPhone 5s. Poor sound quality. Volume control is clumsy and there is no remote.
0,"The volume control being a slider is a little weird. Other than that, it's wonderful!"
1,So far so good. Good sound for the price paid. Are they noise canceling - no. But they do block out some noise and have decent tone.
2,"I bought two sets of these AILIHEN headphones, one for my 5 year old and one for my 8 year old. Both kids love them! They fit well and the sound is great. They seem to be very well made. I would definitely purchase again."
3,"Works well, comfortable. Great Schitt"
4,Great starter headphones for my pre-teen grandchild. Love the color choices.
5,I brought these headphones and they don‚Äôt even last two (2) months... RIP OFF FOR REAL!!!
6,One side stopped working after 3 months
7,"Love these...well did, love. They quit working 3 days after the return window. I recommend buying the insurance. I did not."
8,"I ordered these headphones, and when the package was ""delivered"" it was a completely empty envelope. Not even a piece of paper in it. Nothing."
9,My son liked the color but that's about it. Here we are 2 months later after receiving this item and it no longer works. Very frustrated
0,The headphones are of high quality and love the way they fold.
1,Wonderful headphones
2,Broke after a week.
3,Excellent and my daughter love it!!
4,"We bought these headphones for my 11 year old daughter, and they were too small. We will regift them to a 4 year old niece, instead of going through the hassle of returning. Very cute color though."
5,Very comfortable when I use them. Also I like that it arrived fast. Thanks
6,"They work great. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I personally don't like to have my ears covered, but they are comfortable. I would recommend them to my friends and would buy them as a gift."
7,"Love the color. Love the corded cable. Love that they fold up. However, they are bigger than expected and are quite loose on my 11 year old daughter, and on me (< 40 yrs) as well."
8,Speakers and microphone worked great initially. Now microphone functions only when cord is held at a specific angle.
9,Ear pad falls off easily and is not easy to put back on...it is meant to slip back under a piece which is impossible to so once it falls off.
0,Present for my 11 daughter. She loves them
1,After purchasing these for one of our daughters we bought a second pair for the other daughter as the first pair was such a hit. Colors are great too. Definitely recommending these!
2,Love these
3,A+++
4,Daughter loved them. She lives the gassy that she can fold them up and pack away in her back pack.
5,"These just arrived, and I‚Äôm already in love with them! Fits well, the volume is very accessible and such good sounds!"
6,My son loves them. He is 6 and they fit him great!
7,Very good quality.
8,Bought these for someone else. They are pleased. No news is good news.
9,Best sound quality at a very affordable price!
0,My daughter got these headphones on Christmas Eve (Dec 24) today is Dec 29 and they've already quit working!
1,Fit snugly. Came with manufacturing warranteed of 1 year. Mic and button work great. Good sound quality for it price.
2,Worked for about 2 weeks and then the cable shorted out... don't waste your money! Will be returnng!
3,"While the headphones are a fun color, comfortable to wear and foldable, they only lasted about six weeks. Not worth the money."
4,Great headphones for gaming
5,"My son is very happy with these! He just figured out that they can pause and play, as well as control the volume."
6,Very comfortable fitting and I like that I can fold them up. Good sound quality.
7,We missed the return date by one day. They quit working today. I was hoping they weren‚Äôt cheap. Super disappointed.
8,Wonderful. Told all about these
9,Not very durable. The wire inside the head band is what breaks. Good sound quality when it worked.
0,"Works great! Fast delivery, thanks!"
1,The pin literally fell out of the jack today rendering these headphones useless. And 7 days after our return policy expired :(
2,"What can I say?
This is the best headphone I've owned thus far,its really loud & blocks outside noise.Would definitely recommend."
3,Worked really good for a few days. The cord is very weak.. after a weak they break... all you hear us static... was very disappointed
4,"My son left loves them, great sound and price"
5,Great price. A little uncomfortable after an hour of wear.
6,Nicely made and work great!
7,The headphones do not fit snug on ears. Not a good purchase for a classroom set of headphones.
8,Nice headphones
9,They are a beautiful color and work really well. My daughter loves the volume and pause on the wire cord!
0,These broke within a month of buying them. They just stopped playing sound. Very upsetting for my 8 year old!
1,I enjoyed my pair so much that I ordered a pair for my grandson. Now we both enjoy are Ailihen C8 headphones.
2,I just got them today and they work great!!!! I live the color too. The cord is a little long but I can deal with it. I love the volume slider button on it.
3,"Headphones exactly as advertised. For a low-priced item, it has decent sound and the headphones are comfortable."
4,My daughter loves them.
5,Great purchase! I would definitely purchase from seller again.
6,"Broke quickly, bad sound, don't recomend"
7,Good for the price. Cute and fold up nicely. Very heavy and do not fit completely comfortable.
8,The head phones itself work well but the ear cushions come out very easily and we were unable to put them back.
9,Very nice headphones. Feels comfortable on a (10-year old) child and even on adults. Good sound quality.
0,"DO NOT PURCHASE!!! Right when I opened these, the piece that connects to my phone/iPod broke off. There is dried glue around the edges where the metal piece was clearly glued into the plastic cord. I am returning them. Rip off!!!"
1,Excellent product!! My son loves these!! And the sound quality is super crisp!! Great audio fidelity!! And a great price!!
2,"I had to buy new headphones thanks to my cat chewing through my old ones. I love theses ones because it has a nice durable nylon cord that so far has thwarted the attempts of my cats sharp teeth whenever he manages to attack them while I'm using them. One my favorite things about these headphones is how sound isolative they are, perfect for being able to zone out to my music without being disturbed by any background noise, plus they look nice and are well put together. They are also better quality than ones that I have payed more for in the past so I'm definitely in love with them. Besides the cat, im pretty harsh on headphones myself but I have had these ones for close to a month I believe and I have not had any issues with any kind of parts coming off or the cord breaking easily. At this point I don't have anything bad to say and I'd recommend them to anyone wanting decent headphones without having to spend a fortune on some"
3,I bought it for my niece in college per her request... she said she loves it!!!
4,Love them work great !
5,"Great look, decent sound, easily stored, and strong enough for my 8yr old to use at school."
6,Bought this for my son to use at school in September. It is December and they've been sent home broken. Piece of garbage!
7,So much static! Couldn't hear my media at all. So disappointing.
8,Very nice headphones
9,Great price for this product. My daughter needs headphones for school and I didn't want to get anything too pricey just in case she lost them. They work great and she loved the way they look!
0,Great headphones. Comfortable for an adult sized head
1,"Good headphones that cancels and filters noise. It's also a good color, like the outline of the green popping out."
2,The sound is ok. The band is so large it barely stays on my head.
3,I can ignore the world with these headphones on! These headphones are worth every penny.
4,Kids love it. Volume is amazing and the microphone feature is flawless.
5,Great quality!
6,My son loves these
7,Like the volume control and the adjustable earpieces
8,Decent pair for the price. They were for my 7yr old son. He uses them all the time.
9,My daughter loves them.
0,I'm giving this a 4 rating due to the non adjustment for those with a smaller head. However they work great I use them while doing my housework listening to music or my wonder Bible that I really love
1,"So far these are fantastic...fit well, look great, and the bass response is much better than I expected...For the price, they will be hard to beat..Actually bought 2 more pair for gifts to friends!"
2,"I purchased two of these. One pair stopped working after a month, the second was only used once and the connector piece that goes in the headphone port broke, not completely off but the end is wobbly. Not willing to try plugging it in again for fear it'll get stuck in the headphone port."
3,"The build quality on these is very good and so is the noice cancellation, but the sound quailtity is very meh. The highs are drowned out by the rest of the sound and are very muddy. The bass is fine along with the mids. Overall: Not great, but not awful either.

EDIT: The casing around the headphone plug is VERY weak. They were plugged into my phone in my back pocket, when I sat down the casing around the metal bit that goes into my phone snapped. Have to fidget with it before the sound comes back now."
4,I bought 4 of these. All in different colors. None of them even lasted a month or two. The sound started going out on them. You had to wiggle the cords to get sound back. Then it just finally quit.
5,"For such a reasonable price, these headphones provide great quality sound and I love that they fold up! I use these in my classroom at my computer station and they are very easy for my students to clean and put away. When students are wearing them, I am not able to hear what they are doing which is very nice for my other students. This was a great purchase!"
6,"It looks like a great product and good price too, unfortunately the wiring cable is very fragile. I bought 3 for my kids, they are all broken. I think if the cable was not attached...maybe I just could replace it..however if you still use in a safe place and you don't touch a lot, it may still work for you."
7,Got these for school to go with the Ipads the kids use. Nice that they fold up for storage and adjust easily.
8,I bought an headphone for my son and decided to buy this green headphone for myself. I didnt use it immediately as i bought it. It was still in its case etc. when i started to use it both soft spongy area came off. Making it unbearable to wear and listen to my class work undisturbed. Now i do not have a headphone. I only can look at the useless pretty green headphone as a decoration. I believe i should get a replacement or my money back.
9,"I like that it helps reduce alot of the background noise and that there is a hassle-free microphone for talking. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, it's really bulky. I'm sure that if it was reduced in size, the rating would go up."
0,Fast delivery. Work great! Thanks!
1,My son loves them! Bonus is I can't hear his games now :)
2,"The sound quality is alright, they hurt my ears after a while of use. After around two months the left side stops playing and I have to move the cord around to fix it."
3,Gratefuly surprised of the quality of sound I'm getting from this headphones
4,Great gift for anyone.
5,My daughter was in love with these but yesterday when she pulled them out of the Jack in the car the metal part snapped off! I've never heard of such a thing! She was so upset.
6,I love it a lot .. so much clearer
7,The black leather cover fell off within one week.
8,Love them
9,"One of the ear pieces didn‚Äôt work. :(. One good thing though, they didn‚Äôt charge shipping for the return. :)"
0,"These work well, but they are a little large for my head (however, I'm an adult who has a small head)."
1,Pretty comfortable and works well. Haven't tested microphone aspect.
2,No noise cancelling and you can hear the music from across the room even when someone is properly wearing the headphones. We also had problems with the MIC.
3,Love this item. I got it for my son who loves the headphones
4,bought them for a long flight. love the way they fold. great color. sounds great.
5,My 8 yr old son has used them for over a week now and they are not destroyed ... so yes these things are built well
6,Bought these for my teenage daughter. Light weight and sound is good for the price. She uses them for her laptop and iPhone. It doesn't work with her kindle.
7,"Great sound, not over the ear though. A little uncomfortable after long periods of use"
8,Very comfortable. The sound is a little more dominant on the left side but otherwise they're awesome
9,"I love these headphones, haven‚Äôt found anything wrong yet."
0,Poor quality. The wires started breaking after just a couple of months right by the jack.
1,I loved the product but it is against the law to drive with headphones covering both ears in case of emergency
2,Amazing
3,Got them for my son for his school.... totally disappointed ... Really bad.... got them after 1 week stopped workingüò©üò©
4,They have good sound! Very comfortable! And they look very stylish!
5,This product is cheap . Broke within an hour of my child using them. They break in and out now . Very cheap product .
6,excellent sound
7,"I feel so cool wearing these. My cool points go up 1000%. I can do the whole sidelong ""What are you looking at?"" and people are like, ""Woah, that chick is so cool, we better not go near her unless she shames us for our nerdery.""

All kidding aside--and my jokes are terrible ones--these are lovely headphones. I'm not a headphone aficionado, but these perform just as well as several higher-priced pairs I've had over the years. Plus they're cool. The cord is wrapped in fabric and stuff. It's awesome. They're also massively comfortable and I've worn them for hours at a time without feeling the pinch.

My only complaint is that the sound adjustment is a light touch. It goes from, ""Eh, I could use a little more sound."" to, ""HOLY ****BALLS I CAN'T FEEL MY EARS""

But that didn't take more than the one time to learn, so overall I'm keeping it at a full 5/5 stars. Cheers."
8,"Bought for teenage boy and so far they have held up well and he loves them. They are loud, to the point that when he has them around his neck, i can hear clear as day."
9,Great headphones! They feel very comfortable on my sensitive ears. I usually can't use headphones for long amounts of times due to my ears getting sore. But they feel so snug and comfortable.
0,I use at work. Very comfortable when listening to webinars.
1,"Better than the Sony set these replaced, much better. Only negative, ""made in China"" so it's 4 stars only"
2,Great headphones!
3,I love the headphones. They are super cute and the volume quality is amazing. I highly recommend them
4,Got for my grandson for birthday . He loves them love that they come in many colors .
5,The headphones exceeded my expectations. They are comfortable and sound terrific with either music or the spoken word.
6,"I really love my new headphones! They have great sound, and gold up so conveniently. Plus the color is so cute!"
7,They are for my daughter. She loves them.
8,"Sound is good for the price, only thing is it hurts your ears after a while due to the cheap ear cup cushions."
9,"I love these, exactly what I wanted and has all the features I need. I strongly recommend these headphones."
0,"VERY nice headphones for the price (on sale for 17.00), good sound. Ordered another pair for my younger daughter."
1,"Looks just like the image, it is a little painful after wearing for a few hours but quality is good"
2,These headphones work as described and we loved them enough that my wife decided to get her own and we ordered a third pair for my nine year old son who loved mine!
3,Padding for ear piece came off in a week and now won't stay on
4,"I purchased these for my daughter. She loves them. She's 9, and they are a tad too big, but they do the job."

8,Got it for my son and he loves it.

5,Great headphones. The sound is perfectly clear. A great value!
6,"In less than a month, one side no longer gave sound. A week later the ear pads fell off - this is a piece of junk!"
7,Great for the price
8,Inexpensive option for headphones and conference calls. Nice style too.
9,The sound is good but doesn't fit around your ears very well.

4,Absolutely wonderful!!
5,My son loves them!
6,Great product and the seller is quick with the shipping. I had a wonderful experience.
7,"Bought for my 8 year old in early September, and they're trash by the end. Short in one side. Do not buy."
8,really good headphones for the price
9,I bought them not even a month ago and they are already malfunctioning.
0,my son loves them
1,Only lasted six months before AUX jack broke off in iPad.
2,Very disappointed... Purchased them for my son...they stopped functioning... I need my $99 refunded
3,My husband enjoys them.
4,Sometimes they can pinch you if you are not careful when taking them off. Otherwise they are good.
5,They crapped out after three months. I'll give it two stars because i enjoyed them in the three months I had them.
6,The headphones I got have a problem. When it's plugged into my iPhone my music starts turning off and on constantly. It also causes Siri to turn on and off when I'm trying to listen to music. It's very strange.
7,"Love them! Got them when I was told , and work great!!! My teenager is very pleased and the color is awesome"
8,The sound has good quality but the headphones themselves fit weird. The earphones dont sit on my ear comfortably.
9,"GOOD SOUND,WORTH THE MONEY."
0,I have bought 2 pairs of these headphone and neither pair lasted longer than 1.5 months. I assumed the first pair was just a lemon (it happens) and that's why it only worked for a month. But after buying a second pair of AILIHEN headphone and this pair only last 1.5 month I can only assume that this is an extremely sub par product. I have never had a electronic product perform so poorly. I will never by any product by AILIHEN again - I have no trust in their brand or the quality of their products after this.
1,"It fits my 4 year old pretty well and the 2 year old too, although he's got a big head. They will still slide off if the kids were moving around but I expect them to be fine for our long plane ride since they will be seated. I previously bought soft headphones but apparently any headphone designed for kids has a volume control that is not conducive to plane travel. There's no way they would have been able to hear anything on a loud plane with kids headphones."
2,"I bought these for my daughter, who initially loved them. They were great, for a month. Last week they became staticy and today they stopped working altogether. Extremely disappointing product.

UPDATE: I am happy to say the seller reached out to me and is sending a pair of replacement headphones. I will write an updated review once the product arrives and we have a chance to use them. In the meantime, I am updating to 3 stars because good customer service means a lot in this day and age."
3,One of the ear cups broke off after second use. Could be that my 5 year old was using them or maybe these are junk??
4,"They were used and retuned by a school with writing on the side ""grade 3""......they were retuned"
5,"Really nice headphones with one key problem: The jack sometimes just stops working. I will contact the manufacturer about this, but be forwarned.

Edit: a few months have passed, and they died completely"
6,Have had these headphones a little over a month. Already broke. Everything is in tact... They seem built solid... There's just A short in the wire. If I hold the wire a certain way the sound comes through... I bought three pair of these headphones at once. Two of the 3 have this problem. Disappointed. Would love a refund or replacement. But I don't have my original box.
7,"Does the job. But I will be returning despite the return fee. The moment I opened the packaging, I already thought that it looks super cheap. After I saw that I have to shoulder shipping for return, I have thought about keeping it. But this literally hurts my ear after using it for an hour. This is the first headphone I had ever bought so I am not sure if it's supposed to be like that."
8,"I ordered these back in september and at first they worked great and i really loved them, but its October now and the right headphone only works if i fiddle with the cord for around an hour, and if the cord is jostled too much it starts messing with the volume and opening apps. The button doesn't work anymore to pause things, but the volume sliders does. I'm a little disappointed because i bought the case to protect them and everything and they didn't even last half the time those $5 headphones do."
9,"The headphones are a really cool color and feel comfy, however when playing with them I found out that other people can hear what your listening too. Not what I had in mind for headphones. Also if it's hot outside and your wearing your headphones, expect some trapped heat around your ears, aka sweaty ears. Other than that they are cool and work well. I especially like the long cord and the material surround it; wont crack and fall apart like my apple headphones."
0,Purchased for my 7 year old ti use with his Kindle. He loves it!!! I'm now purchasing for the rest of the family.

9,"IGN: 10/10

These are some good headphones, but having them on my ears for prolonged periods of time cause my ears to sweat, clogging them, and hurts them a little bit. More.. Unconfortable, than painful, actually. The ear cups are NOT made for larger ears. I have pretty normal sized ears, and they're smaller, and don't fit over them like I personally like in headphones (I like my ears inside my headphones. I don't like them on top of my ears, if you know what I mean.) They are actually three colors, The mint, a slightly darker mint where it folds, and the grey all around. Four if you count the silver part that extends to fit your head. Speaking of that, that part is kind of a fingerprint magnet, and I suggest wiping it off if its touched a lot, especially with sweaty hands. They cancel out some noise, and on top of that, are fairly loud. So yeah. Good overall. Have a good day people."
0,Great quality headphones. Sound is great and love the choice of colors.
1,Grandson loves these. They r perfect.
2,"Daughter loves them and so do I, because I finally don't have to listen to her music!"
3,9 year loves them very comfy
4,For $20 i cant believe how good these are. These are just great.
5,Great product! Seem well made and sound is good. Like the fact that they fold up for easy transport.
6,just used on plane...perfect!
7,"Got the headphones, on time, in one piece.. just lacking the bass I thought they would have?"
8,The headphones arrived on time and work perfectly with each electronic I have.
9,I absolutely LOVE them!! They produce great sound and are very comfortable.
0,I especially like the seriously good quality wire...I am thinking that this pair of headphones will last longer than others!!!
1,Not expensive but absolutely superb in tone. Much better than others I have spent more money on. They look good too.
2,My daughter loves them!
3,Nice product Purchased for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them. nice wiring and great functionality. Would definitely recommend.
4,Awesome color and awesome sound!!!
5,I have two of these for my teens and they love them.
6,wire shorted out after a week of light use. Return of item went very smooth
7,Returned. Could hear everything he was listening to while sitting across the room.
8,Great product!
9,Bought for my daughter for Christmas. It broke within an hour of opening. She is 10 yo and is gentle with her things. She loved them so it was very disappointing.
0,Only had a month and they are already broken. Only can hear out of one ear. Cute but not well made.
1,"Good, but the connections are poor. After a couple of months of light use, the cord where it attaches to the headphone has gotten even looser, and I have to hold it at a specific, non repeatable angle to get full audio, meaning that they are now useless"
2,"Kids need this one!! So far my son has not been able to mess up the cord! It's a rope style, braided. The plastic ones, he twists and has sometimes bit them and they stop working properly."
3,I bought two pairs of these for my kids for school this year. One set has already stopped working within 6 months. The other set I had to contact customer service to trouble shoot why it wasn't working after only a few months and we were able to get one set working again. I decided not to deal with them anymore and bought a different kind.
4,"These are crap. Stopped working after 2 weeks, I printed return label and ran out of packing tape... So now I'm out $20 and my daughter has no headphones. I expected so much more from a highly rated product."
5,"Purchased these headphones to replace my daughter's $200 dollar Beats that stopping working on one side after one year. I went on you tube and found multiple videos on how to fix Beats headphones. That's a clue... that Beats headphones break all the time! Moreover, I could not fix them. I did not tell her how much I paid for these Ailihen headphones. I asked her if they sounded as good as her Beats, she repied yes. Awesome purchase! Saved me $180 dollars! She can't tell the difference! Don't waste your money on Beats!"
6,Got these for my 10 year old son. After 3 weeks of normal use the cord shorted and the sound was horrible. Would not re-order this brand.
7,These were great for a couple of months. Then I couldn't hear out of one side. Then they stopped working altogether. Short life span was disappointing for the price and what seemed like good quality.
8,"Nicely packaged, arrived on time.
Seems to be of wood quality.
Nice sound.
Fits my big head very nicely... Adjustable.
Can now hear my CDs and DVDs in spite of noisy surroundings."
9,"I purchased these for a Christmas gift. My daughter used them less than 3 months and one side has stopped working. I have requested the seller exchange them. Hopefully, these were just bad ones. I will update my review if I receive an exchange"
0,The sound is great and the ability to control so easy.
1,The color Is off and it's not as soft as it said otherwise it's fine.
2,I brought this product for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it.
3,"I Love these! Great sound for music, my audio books as well as phone calls. Really comfortable too. Thanks üòä"
4,Love em.Nice color.
5,Very comfortable. Good quality sound.
6,The headphone jack broke less then a month after my teenage son got them for his birthday. Which happened to be a week after the return date.
7,"Unit is already totally dead with no visible issues with cord, etc. Waste of money."
8,This is a great product. We needed a second pair to keep at school. My grandson is autistic and he uses the ipad for communication. He wears the headphones without any resistance. Just like wearing a hat. He looks very comfortable when using them. Thank you.
9,Worked well when we received them. However less than a day later they no longer played on any device we used them on.
0,They look just as in picture and described. Will be giving as a gift
1,Perfect for our 6-year old Granddaughter! Super comfy and the price was amazing.
2,Works fine.
3,Having issues with wiring during the first week and it took weeks to ship from China. Assuming it will not be worth money it would cost to ship it back. Very disappointed.

1,I think I am gonna return it... sound quality is poor and when using to talk people can hardly hear me
2,I usually have to order new headphones for my kids every few months just because they last a while then one side stops working. I ordered two pairs of these (one for each kid). One pair showed up already broken and was returned. The other pair broke after a few days use. Definitely much better headphone options out there.

2,Perfect for my 10 year olds class & she loves the color!
3,Not a lot of adjustment for fitting to one's head; earphones hurt after a short time listening. Not a bad buy though for the price.
4,Very Good!!!
5,"I bought two of these for my teenage girls. One broke after only a month. The other one broke about a month later. This is a piece of junk that I do not recommend at all. I bought my youngest, who is a lot more careless than the older two, a JLAB one for less than $10 JLab Audio INTRO Premium On-Ear Headphones with Universal Mic, Blue and that still works great."
6,Great inexpensive headset.
7,Got product on time. Quality of headphones are great.
8,I returned my headphones because the connection wouldn't fit through the otter box case. There was nothing wrong with the headphone
9,Ours lasted a little less than 3 months before 1 ear stopped working
0,"My daughter got these for her birthday. She absolutely loves them and brings them everywhere. Sturdy enough that her 2 and 4 year old siblings haven't been able to break them yet. After showing them to her cousin, we ended up purchasing another pair for him for Christmas. Great quality, great sound, durable and noise canceling (or selective hearing?)"
1,"Love my new headphones. I use them w/ a new morning & night meditation program. The program requires that the left ear hears thru the left speaker,etc. To get the full benefit of the meditation. The sound quality is excellent.
I highly recommend this product."
2,"Worked, but were extremely tight and painful, tried adjusting just did not conform to head shape. Sound quality was meh. You can get better headphones for the price. Added one star due to customer service reaching out to me, which is better than most products."
3,"I've been through 2 pairs of these. The hinge where the ear piece bends is a plastic, thin pin, and the housing section of that joint does not last, and it will break. Also, I have experienced separation of the ear padding from the speaker section. You get what you pay for.....or a little less in this case."
4,I bought these for my daughter. She uses it every day and says they are very comfortable. Still working after almost a month hopefully they will last until the end of the schoolyear.
5,"These headphones fit over the ear and are quite comfortable. They work very well and are gorgeous! If I ever need another pair, I will definitely be ordering this item again."
6,I love my headphones but the only thing is its too big i heve a little head and they are loud but not that loud but other then that they are perfect they are so cute and i love how you can fold them and the cord its long to you dont have to worry about your headphones tingle and they are comfortable
7,"My 16-year-old loves them, and his little brother hasn't managed to break them yet (unlike the previous 4 pair from other brands). Win."
8,"Comfy and folds nicely. Unfortunately I only get the majority of sound from the R ear. At first I thought the L ear was a dud. But isolating it, sound comes out but VERY softly. So when listening to online lectures I feel like the professor is talking into my right ear."
9,I received the headphones promptly. I‚Äôm not a headphone connoisseur so I can only say that they do what I want them to do. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. I‚Äôm trying to get my 11 year old to order some because she keeps stealing mine!
0,Nine-year-old granddaughter was thrilled to receive this.
1,"My daughter loves her new headphones. Super comfortable, nice looking, and Dad loved the price!!"
2,"Defective, sound only comes out on one side of headphone."
3,"My 11 year old loves them, stylish, comfortable and great quality!"
4,Excellent sound and masking outside noise
5,Great set for children! My 6 year old loves them.
6,Broke after a few months
7,Microphone doesn't work very well. I have to hold up to my mouth for my students to hear me clearly.
8,"Got this for my son, broke within 1 week. These headphones are cheaply made and are not good."
9,My niece absolutely lovestunning them.
0,My daughter absolutely loves these !!!
1,"My son has these just a month. Already the one side doesn't work and it gets static on the other. Poor quality, very disappointed."
2,Love it. Good sound quality
3,I love these headphones my bestfriend and I both got them and couldn't be happier with them
4,Item came damaged.. NEVER worked.
5,"Take these other reviews with a grain of salt because most of them say that they got the product for a discount for their ""honest"" reviews.
I read a lot of them and these headphones seemed like a good choice. Cheap, good looking and claim to have crisp and clear sound.

However, once I got the product things started to get pretty ""meh"" in terms of quality. The packaging was obviously very cheap, but not a major concern.
The build quality seems very sub-par. They look good in the picture, but in reality they are very much plastic and I feel like I am going to break them every time I try to fold them. The ear cushions are somewhat comfortable, but feel awkward (as if they're backwards) on the ears.

Here's my least favorite part though: most of the reviews claim ""crisp and clear sound quality"". I completely disagree. These sound like cheap small earbuds that come standard with the purchase of a phone. I compared these to my pair of Urbanears (which are only about 30 bucks more to buy) and the difference in clarity is instantly noticeable. So if you are buying to replace standard phone earbuds, maybe invest a little more in a better pair of headphones.

I will give 3 stars because they're not horrible considering they're $20, so you pretty much get what you paid for. However, I'm disappointed that the majority of the reviews for the product did not accurately represent what I was getting, especially in terms of sound quality."
6,the sound is wonderful
7,These headphones broke after I had had them for only a few months. These are terrible. I would advise moving on to a different brand the next time you are looking for headphones.
8,More comfortable than other headphones in the past. Kids know how to break things in and so far both speakers still work.
9,Nice fit my 8 year old great and volume did not blast loud

7,Only had for a couple months & they don't work anymore.
8,"Very pretty, fit well!"
9,No complaints
0,"These were great for my 11 year old until they broke in about 3 months. Not sure if it was the headphones or my kid, but I'd likely buy them again. The price is right. In fact, call me crazy (should I have given 5 stars? Find out after my next purchase of these same ear phones!) but I'm going to order another pair right now and see if we can get more than 3 months out of them."
1,"These headphones sound great. I like the look and the way they fold. I have used them both with my android phone and with an old IPod shuffle. I subtracted one star because it does not adjust small enough for my head and the band keeps tipping forward and backward. However, my head is smaller than average and they will probably fit most other people."
2,Used three times and then wouldn't work!
3,"I bought these for my 10 year old sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves them and so does my family. With these headphone not only do we not hear her games or YouTube videos she's watching, she doesn't have all the outside noise keeping her from being able to hear what ever she's listening too."
4,"Lightweight, folds up to fit in my little side pocket on my backpack for school. My daughter who just turned 2 already knows how to pause and play Netflix videos with the volume control + pause/play button on it. Sound is nice. The headphones are so comfortable. The color is gorgeous and matches the picture perfectly.

I also got a coupon for another pair!"
5,"these headphones are really great! The headphones work perfectly.They Adjust fine to a bigger head. They are very comfortable headphones. The headphones fold extremely nicely!nicely, The headphones have a long cord, and look nice.one of my favorite things about these is, Works for gaming consoles,mobile devices,and computers. So Overall, they are very good headphones.They are perfect for everyone!Also they are only $20!$20"
6,"It's a good product, it's me, I wanted something lighter, this seems to bulky for me, I'll surprise someone with a gift and order something more suitable for my needs. Thank you....Bill"
7,I purchased the headphones as a Christmas gift for my mom. They are lightweight and easy to use. The price was great. The ordering process was easy and delivery was quick.
8,I was very surprised that the sound is so great. The volume control is nice especially when the grandkids are using it. The color is great too. They are a little bit bigger than what I am use to using but I noticed this seems to be the style. Very comfortable to wear for a long period. Great headphones.
9,"Got these for my little brother and he loves them! They seem to be very comfy, and he loves the bright green color. Sound quality is great, perfect for playing video games on his 3ds!"

5,They were a little loose on my 11 year old's head.
6,"Great, I love it, so ordered one for my husband."
7,"Great sound, kid loves them."
8,"Decent earphones for $20. The quality of the materials is better than I would have expected.

Pros:
- Decent sound
- Folding
- Adjustable
- I like the slide volume switch.

Cons:
- Ear pieces are rigid. I mean they do not rotate to meet the ears so they feel tighter on the rear of my ears, and touch much more lightly on the front of my ears. The soft pads help a bit to compensate for the rigid ear pieces.
- The ear pads are not larger than my ears. The headphones set on top of my ears rather than surround my ears. This makes them less comfortable and they don't cut out ambient noise as well."
9,Snug to the head. Blocks out back ground noise.
0,Fast delivery. Work great! Happy with purchase.

9,our son is really enjoying them
0,"I was having issues with low volume on my son's Amazon Kindle Fire and lots of headphones were not working very well. These did a fantastic job and he loves them. Highly recommend and given the price, a great deal!"
1,These worked great for one week. Then just stopped working all together. They were not dropped or mishandled. I contacted the seller regarding a replacement or return and never got a response. One week later I purchased another pair of headphones from the same seller but would not have done that if I had realized it was the same seller that had never responded to my message regarding a replacement.
2,These work great. The sound is so clear. I have only use them this week but so far I'm very pleased. Great headphones at a great price. They were shipped quickly as promised
3,Not a good purchase for me. Unless i tape the microphone button down the sound barely works. Disappointing the ears do not twist for a firmer fit.
4,"Initially these headphones sounded pretty good. I was hoping that ordering a set with a braided cord would last longer. Unfortunately it was not to be. After just 2.5 months, there is a short in the cord and they no longer work well at all - very staticky and sounds terrible.

Pros: fit good, well constructed headset.
Cons: not good for on the go, or for kids use. Cord easily becomes tangled and develops,a short."
5,"Bought this product for my son. He has not removed them since he got them. They are comfy and perform very well, microphone and speakers work fine."
6,"These headphones are very comfortable and love the foldable function, however the negatives outweigh the positives by a landslide. The microphone sounds horrible, but that's not the worst of it. While being relatively inexpensive, they do not last long at all before they lose sound in one ear, or both. The longest any of them have lasted has been 4 weeks. We continued to buy them because of the comfort factor but will not purchase another pair."
7,I got these to use with my roko instead of ear buds which I hate they are good as far as tv sound the cushion could be a little thicker and wider. But other than that for the price I'm happy with them. Will probably try another brand and give these to one of my grands.
8,"We purchased 2 of these as holiday gifts for teenagers in need. They arrived quickly! As it was the only item on their lists, I wanted to make sure to get nice ones. I read many online reviews before purchasing and these seem to be a solid pair. I won't be using them personally - so I can not attest to quality."
9,My 6 year old thinks these headphones are so cool and I'm happy that I didn't have to spend a lot of money to make him happy. Sound is average.
0,Great headphones for the price!
1,Stopped working within one month after normal use. You get what you pay for.

6,These are great headphones at a great price. They look exactly like the do online.
7,"Only 4 stars because I had to return them. Nowhere in the description, did it say these headphones were LARGE. I ordered them for my 8 year old son and they arrived and were too big, so I had to send them back. A hassle. I wish I had known they had a SIZE, I thought headphones were one size fits most. I only looked at them for about a minute while he tried them on, and they seemed like decent quality for the price. We never plugged them in to see the quality of the sound, but at a glance and a brief encounter, they are good, just be aware of the fact that they will not fit a youth size head."

0,"I ended up having to print out a return slip for these TEN MINUTES after I opened up the package and tried them out. I literally didn't even get to enjoy them for a full day. Immediately when I plugged them into my phone, my laptop, my husband's laptop and phone, the sound on one side was gone, and the other side was awful. The sound control thing didn't work AT ALL. And the fit was uncomfortable. The earpieces felt like they were turned just a little bit so they weren't over my ears properly.

Pro-tip: If you come across headphones that go for under $25 and have a white nylon braided cord? They're made by the same lousy manufacturer and just sold under different names and they will either not work or stop working very quickly. Brands like AILIHEN, BienSound and others. Go for a brand you've heard of. Ugh."
1,"The product received was the same one described online. The pictures were spot on. They really are that shiny. I previously owned headphones that went in my ears and grew tired of them. So I picked these out and they go over my ears. They are super comfortable because of the padding they have (I fell asleep with them on). They have a pause and play button on the side. I really don't care for the volume control. It is a slider control. I just use the volume control on my phone to adjust the volume. The CORD is awesome. Its like a shoelace that doesn't tangle up on you. They are easy to adjust to your head. You just have to pull them down on the sides. They do fold up for storage. As for the sound, everything comes out clear. There is no static. Again, I switched from in ear headphones to over the ear headphones so these were overall a great upgrade."
2,"My 12 year old grandson showed these headphones to me on Amazon and asked me to buy them for him. He gave me the money and two days later he had them. He loved them. Good value, good styling and he loved the sound.
One week later he texted me saying the headphone plug broke off in his phone. He was very upset.
They should certainly have lasted more than a week. I cannot recomend them."
3,"NOT LONG LASTING.
These were great for about three or four months but have now stopped playing sound out of the right ear. It wasn't like I was constantly using them either, I'm not a huge headphone person so would usually try to listen to something straight out of the device so it wasn't really them just getting over used or abused--for the most part they stayed in my desk drawer until I needed them and then one day when I needed them, the sound in the right ear kept cutting in and out and now it's gone altogether and will pop up occasionally if I move in just the right way."
4,"Really like these headphones, but the adapter where it plugs in is ready giving me static, and at times, the sound drops. Other than that, the sound is pretty good, and I love the longer cord. They are small enough to fit on ear and not be bulky when they're around your neck as well. The fact that they fold makes them easily stored. The earpads are fairly comfortable; keep in mind, they will get warm after longer sessions. However, they don't hurt my ears. I really like the colors and build, and I would consider giving them another shot when they completely go out."
5,"I now walk a lot and wanted sturdy head set. This allows me to talk to people who call me (they hear me great they say) and listen to great music. Sturdy- they also fold nice. Good quality. They would make a good gift too.

I had to change my review after a few months-because I don't use these all the time-I use them when my husband takes my iPhone your plugs I Kathy says the second set-and the past like five times I've walked her job using music only one here works it goes in and out if I have to play with it. I don't have a problem with either your phone so I'm going to assume it's this. I don't have anyone I said that problem. If I had given these excessive use of wouldn't care because I know I got them at a good price-but I think they should've lasted longer than this. They do still work-but only one here and the other one popped in and out"
6,Not impressed at all with these. I used them for work and they often require me to unplug them and replug them in because the Mic looses connection. They're basically just sitting here looking cute now. The are decently comfortable but that means nothing if I can't rely on them for the microphone.
7,"This is a great pair of headphones. They look really gorgeous, fit well, are comfortable to wear, and sound great. I bought these for my daughter to use, so I really appreciate that the cable is braided which will help them to last longer and not get as tangled up. I also really like how they fold up so they don't take up as much space for storage or to bring along on a trip."
8,"These are junk. Cheap headphones that do not last long at all. When they did work, the sound quality is poor. I know they are $20 headphones but I cannot believe all the good reviews for these. They just don't sound good. I was expecting a lot more from the reviews. We had these for approximately 3 months before the volume slider became a weak point and decided to stop working hence making the headphones completely unusable. The audio became low and garbled. You get what you pay for and sometimes, reviews don't tell the real story."
9,I purchased 2 sets of them for my grade school daughters since they use netbooks in their classroom. They don't like earbuds because of their small ears. I looked online for an affordable pair of headphones and thought I would try them. They arrived in a couple of days and packaged very nicely. I was surprised how good they look in person. The sound quality is amazing. Very impressed. I always look at reviews and these headphones live up to their high ratings. I recently bought another pair.
0,My six year old is using these at school and enjoying them very much. They are holding up well and performing better than the last pair she had.
1,I bought these headphones for my 6 year old son to use at school. He had previously used ear buds that were uncomfortable for him and didn‚Äôt stay in place. He loves these headphones. They are comfortable for him to wear. The cord has a fabric type covering that makes them more durable for kids. We liked them so much I bought another pair for my other son.
2,"These worked for less than 3 months. I bought a total of 3 pairs one for each of my teens. None of them are functioning. Sound has quit playing altogether through the head phones. I liked the color, style and the kids said they were comfortable to wear. Sad these didn't last longer than 3 months."
3,doesn't work all the time
4,"Sound quality is pretty good according to the teenager! However, cord by plug in to device is already frayed and shorted out so sound only comes out of one ear.....my teenager says its his fault...however exterior disc on outside of headphones on one side already came unglued, again teenager says it his fault and not product defect. I say its probably a 50/50 shot."
5,"These are great as headphones but eventually the padding came off, making them impossible to wear.
I managed to tuck them over the plastic but they fall off in my backpack."
6,"While these are cute and comfortable to wear, the music sounds terrible. Sounds hollow and echos with nearly no bass. I have only used a few times and they are holing up well, but they do feel a bit flimsy and cheap. I guess that can be expected with $20 headphones. I will be returning."
7,"Let me tell you about the glory that is these headphones. So I am not an earbud person- therefore when my cat ate through my old headphones, I was distraught. I thought to myself nightly- what am I ever going to do? I can't hear music. I can't listen to audio books. I can't even watch really stupid YouTube Videos without my roommate hearing. My cat, evil dictator that he aspires to be, laughed maniacally at me. I searched everywhere for a decent pair of headphones that were cheep enough that I wouldn't be too upset if he ate through them again.

AND THEN I MET THE AILIHEN C8 LIGHWEIGHT FOLDABLE HEADPHONES AND MY LIFE WAS CHANGED!

They're cute. The sound is glorious. The feel on your ears makes you want to divorce your husband because he CANNOT please you like these headphones can. The jack works perfectly, smooth like the strings on a violin. It works on any type of phone except the iPhone 7. Did I mention they're cute- I can now actually be one of the popular kids at school, which is impressive since I'm a grad student. If I were going to jail I would forfit my one phone call if I could just keep these headphones with me. Also the braided cord is cat- proof so liiiike I'm in heaven."
8,"Good basic head phones. Not adjustable but the sound quality is alightly above other head phones I have used and much cuter, but nothing abive and beyond"
9,"I bough 4 pairs of those (for kids). For 2 of them, one side of the headset stopped working after a few days. For the third, it stopped altogether (fiddling with the connector would sometimes make it work, but no time for that!). The fourth is still ok. So not great in terms of quality."

7,My daughter has already broken them. The sound goes in and out on them. She only had them maybe two weeks.
8,Cheap made
9,"These headphones are cheap and the sound quality is what you paid for... about $10 of sound quality. My problem with them is they are so terribly uncomfortable. After wearing them for more than 20 minutes my ears hurt terribly. Most over the ear headphones have 360 degrees of movement from the headpiece to the earphone but these only have a little bit of give up and down.

I returned these - they are too uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes at a time and I wanted something I could wear most of the day at work."

3,good product
4,"Work pretty well for calls. Decent quality for price. Would give more stars if it weren't for the unadjustable band... wish that was stated more explictly in the description or photos. I have a fairly large head and these are just on the edge of being acceptable.

45 Days Update (1/3/16): These headphones just stopped working for no good reason. No one could hear me properly and all the audio I was receiving was inconsistent and garbled. I have not done anything to ""abuse"" these headphones; I only use them for work, so they're either on my desk or in a section of my backpack"
5,Love this product and the color brightens my mood ..
6,My 11-year old daughter loves them!
7,I could be better
8,It already broke. Needs returned
9,Works great!! Happy with it.
0,Good quality. My Grandson (5 years old) loves them.
1,Great bang for the money!
2,Had less than a week and the jack broke off right in the Kindle.
3,These work as expected. Wish no one could hear outside of them but otherwise very happy with this purchase.
4,"They work fantastically well, very happy with my purchase!"
5,Cute but broke in 2 mounths.
6,"Bought this for my son, great value for the price."
7,great headphones!
8,"Amazing Quality for a nice price. Loud if you want them to be, easy to store and the price can't be beat."
9,They have a great sound
0,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my son. I didn't expect great sound given the price, but I did expect them to work more than a week. IWithin a week, the sound only worked sporadically, going on and off without warning. This was a big disappointment!"
1,Disappointing. Very short (I mean VERY SHORT) cord.
2,"Our cat tends to chew through cords so I had to buy my daughter new ones recently. This color is her absolute favorite, so I knew she'd love them right away. The sound is really good and she says they're very comfortable to wear."
3,The end broke off inside my granddaughters tablet. Had a difficult time getting it out. She's six so I am not sure if she was too rough when she inserted the headphones or if it was a defect. I know it wasn't because she dropped the tablet or something like that. It has a warranty but I figure they will say it was her fault. My thought is that it should have been more durable so I'm giving it a 3. They don't look like cheap headphones and I like how they fold up and they worked great until the end broke.
4,"This is a beautiful pair of headphones. Primarily for my wife on her laptop, occasionally I have slipped them on as well. She loves them and I do too. They are comfortable, adjustable, and have a great sound. They appear and feel like they are well made.
We love them."
5,They look awesome. They sound great. Only problem is they hurt my ears after a while where they sit over them. But I'm happy with them.
6,My daughter talked me into these because she loved the color. They quit working 2 weeks after the return window. They were used regularly but not abused or thrown around. Huge wast of money. You can get a decent pair of Sonys for about the same price and they will last much longer.
7,These headphones were purchased for a 7 year female to use with her Kindle. She plays Minecraft in concert with her brother and sister and keeps these headphones on for a long time and never complains.
8,The headphones are great! They were shipped and received quickly. Sounds quality is good and the color is fantastic. There is little to no leakage which is great being in a dorm right now. And also bonus plus if you want to muffle any sounds around you just put these on. They give me a bit more quiet when around other people.
9,I bought these for my son and they were great for 3 weeks until the jack thing that plugs into your device snapped off. At first I blamed my son for being rough with them but I see this is a common complaint. I will not be buying again.
0,"For me I had headphones close to a week. I'll say this I live in New York the temperature here is really cold. I purchase for myself for the cold, music, and gaming too why not. First I went out with it and my ears were warm and toasty nice. Second the music the headphone comes with manual volume switch and a button to answer phone call or such. The audio was good the ear cups were cushion nice. It did not felt like my head was being squish like a water ballon like other headphones. Gaming I have a ps4 and a pc audio was good but speaking it was rough some part but I was hearabl√© on most part. The material feels kinda cheapie but all else it does its work pretty well. So 4/5 ‚òÜ good pair of headphones for a good price."

5,"Very comfy. I wear them all day at work. I like that you can adjust the volume right there, so if I can't/don't want to pause something but need to hear someone else, it's easy to change the volume.

I haven't had a reason to test the mic yet. Sound is wonderful though. Although not noise-cancelling, with music playing they almost are. No complaints about leaking sound from coworkers yet :)"

1,Poor quality only lasted a month
2,I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift for her to work on audio projects. She was very disappointed by the Microphone Mic recorded voice with the loud high pitched background static noise (unbearable high pitch noise like scratching nail on the blackboard). I just noticed this last night after I bought it for her a month later as my daughter was so shy to tell me that a gift from Santa was this bad (my heart was really hurt after hearing this!). Very disappointed by this product!!! I am trying to see if I still can return this.
3,Nice headphones for a young person

5,For the price I wouldn't expect it to be so clear.but it sounds so good!!!
6,sound not what expected
7,"Do not be fooled by the attractive color, these are terrible headphones. I got them today and immediately noticed that the sound quality was poor and the fit of on my ears was just terrible. I tried to adjust them but I don't think it's possible. I was kind of annoyed by this, but figured it was worth testing them out anyway. After wearing them for 30-45 minutes I found I could no longer bear the discomfort in my ears stemming from these really hideously designed headphones. I read a lot of the reviews on Amazon before choosing to buy, and noted that many had received these headphones free for their ""honest and unbiased"" review. I think perhaps getting something free tends to improve people's opinion of the thing. I would highly advise against getting these terrible headphones!"
8,Works great...good buy!
9,"Comfortable to wear, sound is good quality, easy to adjust headphones size to head.

Volume control is a bit annoying in its placement - because of where it is on the cord, I kept adjusting the volume down by accident. It took me a while to figure out that was happening - I thought the headphones were broken, but it was just me brushing up against where I was sitting that was causing the volume to fluctuate. So be aware of that if you get these."
0,"Good sound quality, I like the longer cord. AND it fits all of my electronic devices, phone, laptop, tablet, notebook and all my home computers."

8,My brother just loves it.
9,Love them so far. Have been exactly what I wanted.
0,great experience since it looks so nice and sounds great
1,"Pros: Super comfortable and work well. Love that they fold up.

Cons: The jack stopped working less than a month after owning. We returned them and bought a different kind. The other pair we had bought of this model is still working well, so it may just be that you have to be gentle with them.

Update Sept. 2017- Other pair had its jack stop working as well. Would not recommend these headphones."
2,not comfortable
3,pretty comfortable and they fit nicely over the head
4,This works great !!!!!
5,"Seem very nice, my 11yo says they are comfy. Sound quality is fine, not spectacular (again according to 11yo) and not bad. He uses them for Xbox. Proof will be in how long they last...he blows through headphones every few months. I'll come back and raise or lower the rating based on longevity."
6,Headphone jack broke off in iPad.
7,Good
8,"I do like these, very pleased and so well priced."

3,Thank you!
4,"Saw these cute speakers, and decided to get them as a Xmas present for my grandson..but of course I had to check them out first, cause I don't want him to be upset with them, if they wouldn't be loud and clear enough. But geez the clearty was great, so I know that he is going to be really happy to have them."
5,"These headphones worked great! I had made the mistake of buying a few from the dollar section at target and they always broke so I was going to spend the money on these knowing they would last. I even bought the storage case and religiously put them in there when they weren't being used. A bit ago one of the headphone cushions started to separate from the actual headphones. Then one day it just came off. I don't use them roughly and I've taken good care of them.
Now my son needs a pair of headphones for school coming up and I wish I could order him a pair of these since they worked well while they had two connected cushions but I just can't bring myself to do it! And I cannot even find a way to contact your company through amazon to ask you to make this better so that I'd feel great about ordering him his own pair of headphones and a case. I haven't even owned them that long. The $5 target ones lasted longer."
6,met all expectations...very satisfified
7,"Not great, but some decent headphones"
8,"I ordered these headphones on 7/23 and gave them to my daughter on her birthday on 7/26. She loved them. However, yesterday, 9/1, she told me that the cord was apparently wearing out because the sound was fading in and out in one ear. Very disappointing that they would give out so quickly."
9,"My Ailihen C8 headphones are an inexpensive product that works well. I was concerned about two issues: heat on my ears and isolation from the outside world. Using the Ailihens while on long walks on several hot days, the headphones proved not too hot for my ears. The degree of sound isolation was high enough to focus the sound quite well, but yet I could still hear automobiles and dialog clearly and well, which I believe is necessary for safety and also convenient when someone offers a greeting or asks a question. The headphones are also comfortable, with good adjustability."
0,"Very comfortable. Not completely sound excluding. I can still hear my husband's voice when he talks to me. Which is actually a good thing. And they fold up nicely and fit in my handbag. They look cute, too."
1,"Bought it for my daughter for her birthday in September 2017 and it already broke.
The wire got loose inside and the sound now on and off.
Where is the integrity, people?!?!
We are working hard for our money.
Very disappointing!!!!!"
2,"Low quality and likely to break or stop working shortly. I bought two sets of these earphones for my kids. One, the head strap broke nearly immediately. The other, one earphone stopped working just after 30 days. The return policy on these is 30 days or something -- 50% of the time, yours will stop working shortly after that. I'd shop around if I were you."
3,"These meet my needs exactly. They are comfortable, work well and are nice looking. Tried some bluetooth ones, but couldn't get them to work consistently. Even though this is a plug in, I can depend on getting the sound I want with no hassle."
4,"For the most part these headphones work fine. I have only used them for about two weeks while viewing Netflix movies on my I-pad.
Why three stars? Well, I wear glasses and after 30 minutes or so of wearing the headphones, the top of my ears hurt. This annoys me greatly.
(Note: I hate earbuds. I've tried several different styles....no luck.) If anyone has a good remedy for taking the pressure off the arms of my glasses, while wearing earphones I'm all ears... (pun intended)"
5,"Love it! We bought 2, one for each car (in color matching the car) so my son can always have them when on trips."
6,I really liked them at first but they stopped working after about 2 or 3 months. I liked the color since it matches some of my gym outfits and the sound was good but then it stopped working.
7,"We bought these headphones for our boys' new tablet devices in advance of a weeks-long road trip. Both sets were broken within a few weeks. I can concede that the bent jack on one pair was likely do to boy damage, but the second pair lost sound on one side within weeks for no reason. Disappointed."
8,"Excellent sound for a very competitively priced headphones! Actually bought these for my daughter, who LOVES them, but I've tested them out and I'd be happy if I had a pair to wear too!!! (although I'd pick a different color - lol)"
9,They were a gift to my husband. He has been very happy.
0,"I am delighted with these headphones, The sound is quite good for the price and the volume control, which is a slider and the only control that I use, works well."
1,I bought these as a gift for a nine year old. He loves them and says they sound great. They also fold which is very convenient.
2,"My daughter loves these headphones; she uses them with her Kindle Fire. My only complaint is that she can't hear me calling her when she's wearing them! I guess that's kind of the point, though."
3,"For the money, these are very good headphones--comfortable, good sound quality. The only thing I wished were different is if they were actually adjustable. They fold up very compactly, but it's ""one size fits all"" in terms of the fit. Good volume slider control, and you can answer the phone with a push of the button. Reduces exterior noise very well. If you're looking for decent headphones without spending a huge amount, these are a very good value/quality for the cost."
4,"These are really great heaphones...until they don't work properly. We have only had these for about a month and the cord is all wonky, the sound going in and out whenever the cord is jostled in the slightest. Disappointing."
5,These are cute but they don't cover the entire ears and they don't move any more either. I don't really like them and may send them back.
6,"Item defective right out of the box. Mute button stuck on; only unmuted when pressed. Sadly, we threw out the box before we realized this, so no return. Live and learn, I guess."
7,"These headphones are great! The audio isn't quite as great as I had hoped, but they are still a great pair of headphones! I mean, you can't really expect too much from a pair of headphones that are this cheap! But I am pleased with the overall look and comfort of them. They are a little big for my head, but not to the point of discomfort or ridiculousness. Also, the headphones fit perfectly over my ears. I am very pleased with this product!"
8,"The sound quality on these are great. I can have the volume turned up and set them down and I can clearly hear it as if I had an external speaker attached. I used them mostly for music, but have used them for my job to take calls while working remotely and have no complaints."
9,It was a birthday gift that went over very well. My grandniece was thrilled. The headphones arrived on the other side of the country right on time as promised. Everyone was happy.
0,"Great quality. Daughter uses frequently. Pretty, too!"
1,My daughter loves these headphones. They do a nice job of amplifying the sound and the sound is clean and crisp.
2,"I have really enjoyed my headphones.Headphones,AILIHEN C8 Lightweight Foldable Headphone with Microphone Mic and Volume Control for iPhone,iPad,iPod,Android Smartphones,PC,Laptop,Mac,Tablet,Headphone Headset for Music Gaming(Black/Blue)

Would have rated 5 except the fast forward/rewind button stopped working within the second week after I bought them."
3,good sound and I love the volume control
4,Bought for grandson and he loves it!
5,My 7 year old daughter chose these as headphones to bring to school to use with the iPads and computers in her classroom. She loves them and they work very well. No issues yet and we've used them for about a month.
6,"These are awe full. I bought two pair for my kids. Neither lasted more than 2 months before having problems. One of the sides (I think it is the right side, opposite the cord ingress) goes out on them. I was going to return them, but they failed after the return window. I found this due to two reasons. Very poor wiring (tape used instead of a proper solder) for the connections, and the wires at the ingress point are susceptible to breakage due to bad design. Any tug or pull on the cord will easily disconnect/break the wiring. I would not recommend them to any one."
7,Purchased for my 11 yr old grandson and he loves them. BIG smile!
8,Great purchase!
9,Purchased as a Christmas gift. My grand son is going to love it !
0,"I bought these for my 7 year old, to use in first grade. They seem to work great, and the bright green color stands out, so it is easy for him to find his earphones, mixed in with the 20 other pairs of black ones!"
1,"11/4/17 update: these crapped out after about 6 months and one side stopped working. OLD: I got these to use with my XBox One S and they work great, mic works and they are comfortable for a long gaming session or watching a movie quietly."
2,Love the headphones. The sound is great.
3,satisfied
4,love it
5,"For the price these are great headphones, I bought them for a trip overseas...good sound, comfortable.
I've used them for a conference call & my team said I sounded more crisp than on my regular phone at work-these might be the replacement for my headset.
If they adjusted more, to be smaller, they would get more stars."
6,"I've purchased many items on Amazon, but this is the first time I've ever felt the urge to post a review. I bought these headphones for my daughter this past Christmas. She has used them periodically the past four months and they are already broken. Everything appears fine (no kinks in cables, etc) however they no longer function.

I checked the return policy and the return window closed January 31st, barely a month after purchase. That's not good business practice. My first and last purchase of an AILIHEN product!"
7,It turned better than I expected. Perfect for my kid.
8,Bought these for my daughter an she loves them..
9,"Headphones has a nice and clean sound. I like the way that I am able to fold them and store them in my bag. My husband used them, so now I have to purchase a pair for him. Colors are great."
0,I bought these for my 9yr old to use with his ipad for school and personal use. They only lasted 6wks and now he longer hears any sound when he uses them. It's hard to find a quality headphones for kids without spending a fortune on a pair.
1,"What's to say the sound is great it offers noise reduction ( for you ) and it has a reasonably long and sturdy cored. I just wished the donuts were more softer and confabulate, my ears tend to hurt after 3 hours of wearing them...than again I have been wearing them for 3 hours so that might just be it XD that one star is because I wanted mine to be purple."
2,"The reviews seemed promising, so I purchased this pair of headphones hoping for the best. I have now learned that you get what you pay for - the sound was muffled and the earpieces didn't even fit properly over my ears when I took them out of the box to try them the day they came. Incredibly disappointed. Will be returning."
3,After reading all the reviews from everyone helped me make the decision to buy them. I'm glad that I did. Worth the money.
4,"My elementary schooler went through two of these already in less than a year! The wire is intact, the pads are good but there is no volume."
5,Very good sound and i love the the folding and light weight
6,Love them!! Perfect for my gaming and for my traveling needs!!
7,"super lightweight, i got them for running cause earbuds always fall out of my ears. These are comfortable to run/walk in and the music sounds great"
8,"After 1 months worth of daily use, one side doesn't work and the side that does work has static."
9,Really good
0,My daughter used the headphones today for the first time and the pad for one of the earpices fell off! After wasting 20 minutes trying to put it back together it's still not on and now have to figure out how to send them back! seriously disappointed!
1,"This headphone were perfect then the tip of the cord broke in the mp3 device after 2 days use. We decided that it might have just been a unusual problem because the rest of the headphone was of great quality and the sound very clear.
So, we filed up for a replacement but apparently could only get reimbursed which is already great because they didn't have any complains about our request. We are now waiting for our refund, and seriously consider buying the same exact headphones if they are still available."
2,"After 6weeks of use the wire connection became loose, causing my audio to skips/fades constantly. I only use these at work occasionally, and this short of a lifespan for something I barely use is ridiculous. I would not recommend these at all."
3,"The sound is simply awful. Not much more to say. I bought them, and I stopped using them."
4,Cannot wait to give them to him for Christmas.....he will love them
5,Daughter loves them
6,After one month very pleased. Pretty color. Durable. Long cord.
7,"When I first recieved the product I was happy. Good sound quality, loud enough to block out the sounds of a college library, and I could still talk on the phone with them in. But after three weeks or so of being in my backpack, cord wrapped nicely up and tight- one side stopped working. So I had to throw them away because Ailihen would not send me a replacement."
8,"Good lightweight headphones for the money. The design, comfort and sound quality are good for the money. While these are certainly not the best sounding headphones I have, they could very well be the best ones I have in the same price range. It doesn't come with any carry bag though.

Recommended if you want something stylish and inexpensive with good but not great sound quality. For noticeably better sound quality you'll probably need to pay at least double the price.

I couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars so I'm going to say 4.5 stars for the money and round up to 5.

NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write."
9,Weight is right for a 8 years old.
0,good stuff...sound quality is ok....looks good but does not have a mic!!!!!
1,"I use this for VR headset, good sound isolation, fits pretty comfortably around headset straps. In line mic lets me take calls."
2,"These are great for children. They are a little small for my head but they work great for my 3 kids (Ages 5, 7, and 9) A plus was the cord is one of those fiber kind and not the rubber which keeps them from being chewed on, if you have a child who likes to chew on all things rubber. Overall the kids love them and it makes long car rides very quite, which makes me love them."
3,great product. I am really happy with them.
4,"Love my headphones, especially to watch movies on my iPad and my PC, they are very comfortable to wear!"
5,"Goed price, seems to do what is says on the box. Son is happy.
Update , didn't last very long. Now only in mono"
6,"These headphones broke 2 days after the 30 day return window expired. My guess is they were broken in advance of this, however my 8 year old was scared to tell me the new headphones were not working. The cord needs to be jiggled to get any sound. And then it only comes out of one side. Save your money and buy something else."
7,The headphones are crap. I've only had them for a month and a half and now they don't work. I kept them in a special case so I didn't cause any damage they just stopped working. Don't buy if your looking for longevity
8,"They work okay, I guess. Look decent too. And they also give you a massive, aching pain in your ears as the press into your head. After finally taking them off, I've got an ache in my ears, a sense of relief, and disappointment in having bought these."
9,"light weight, quality sound, and sleek look."
0,Great product. Fun color and excellent sound quality!
1,THE MIC DOESNT WORK-rip off
2,My little son is really enjoying it.
3,Arrived quick and they work great! My new favorites!
4,It works very well
5,Great product.
6,Christmas gifts!
7,Grandson loved them!
8,"In perfect condition, works great, and got in right on time"
9,"These headphones are terrible, I received them to use in my classroom as a donor choose project and have had them for 2 months and only four are still working out of the 10 I purchased. I am very disappointed with these headphones and wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
0,great product just need to make them sound proof
1,"These looked like they were going to be the perfect earphones, but they stopped working after just 4 months of very light use (my son used them at school for less than 30 ms a day).

We would return them but the window of time to return them has expired."
2,"great buy , work great"
3,Perfect for price.
4,Love them
5,Good quality. This is my second pair.
6,"These headphones stopped working after only a couple months of use. The headphone jack doesn't function properly. It was a lovely product while it worked, but sadly I can't give a good review."
7,Purchased mid August 2017. Already broke. Microphone no longer works. So if you are looking for a headset that lasts about 3 months for $20 this is your set!
8,Nice headphones.
9,Love the size and color
0,"Packaging was fine. When I took out of the box the first time and tried to use, one of the headphones was out like so many of the cheap earbuds you can buy anywhere. Don't waste your money..."
1,This Product Headphones did not last 30 days.We were traveling.coming home I realize the Headphone work only on one side and only when it wants.I am not a comp wiz and do not know what to do.Please your advice. thank's Marcel
2,I bought this for my daughter in January and by March she said that she can't hear anything anymore. I am very upset that it didn't even last over 3 months! I wish this headphones were better quality!
3,Sound quality and volume were as expected - I'm pleased with my purchase!
4,Lasted 5 weeks...just long enough to not be able to return them. You get what you pay for here
5,"Good, solid pair of headphones. Good for kids."
6,"I liked the product and the customer service was excellent. But the sound kinda fell through. I don‚Äôt know what happened the volume is really low now. But, overall it was a good Product."
7,Loved the headphones! My 7 year old uses them ecerywhere. 2 months later they broke. What annoys me is there is no one to contact to get s replacement. Stand behind your product!
8,"These work really well, they cancel out some of the outside noise which I did not really expect. They fit comfortably too. Initially I thought they were not adjustable but, in fact, they are!"
9,Worked great for a little while and now not at all. We bought them for our daughter and she loves them but can't use them now. We have the year warranty with them.
0,great sound for the price take them everywhere
1,These worked great for listening to my music working out...for around a month..now only one side works and can not be fixed. I would not recommend.
2,My son loved the color of his headphones! He needed them for school and told me no one else has the same color!
3,Fold away neatly. Sounds quality is good. Blocks out outside noises. Soft pads make them comfortable on your ears.
4,Bought these headphones for my kids. They are just as described and good quality. I will definitely buy them again. Fast shipping as well.
5,Awesome! Packaged nicely!
6,"Pretty good sound. A bit bulky but not too heavy on the ears. Overall, I'm pleased and would recommend."
7,I love it!!!
8,"Love to color, very comfortable, love that they fold. Only negative, which isn't a huge negative, is that they are not adjustable."
9,I bought them for a 15 year old. He says they are great. Good sound and likes the fact he can plug it in his phone and talk.
0,"UPDATE: 1 month later, 1 ear no longer works. The jack piece BENT! My son has been no more or less careful than he has with other headphone sets, and those have lasted years!

Took rating down from 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The Good sound, comfortable fit, cute colours, but pretty thin wire. I'm worrying about these holding up to daily use. Maybe they'll be great but I'm hesitant about giving 5 stars because--unless there is some space age technology in there--I know these won't last and I can't figure out why they'd go so thin!"
1,"I really am very satisfied with this head phone.
Because i am older, they are very comfortable to use"
2,Love them! They are so comfortable!
3,Worked for 2 months and then started cutting out in each ear piece.
4,Good for the price
5,Microphone don't even work.
6,Need to return the Blu studio selfie S070Q phone case it won't fit my phone.
7,"feel a little heavy and bulky to me, but the sound quality is fine."
8,its okay
9,Product is lightweight and very easy to use. The sound is great.
0,I've ordered these headphones about 4 times. They're really great but after a few months they stop working. I keep ordering them though because they're great while they work.
1,"These are great quality! I bought these for my son on road trips, so he could watch movies on his tablet. Before he complain that he couldn't listen to his movie with other noise going on in the car. But these are perfect. He can put them on and turn them up with no noise interruptions."
2,"Great basic headphones. I use them to watch my ""shows"" while my daughter is sleeping. They hurt a tiny bit, but my ears are super sensitive, so it could be me. Overall, great value for the product and good headphones for those who don't like buds."
3,"I expected these to be a nicer pair for my 11yr old, but within three months they already don't work. If we wriggle the wire carefully, we can get one side to work, but that's it. My daughter is very careful with tech but these just didn't last any longer than the junkiest pair, so might as well buy 5 pairs of lesser head phones instead."
4,"I love these headphones. I have had a very hard time finding good headphones lately, especially in ear headphones. These have great sound quality and having a sliding volume button on the headphones is a great feature to have. I will definitely buy these again if I need to that is!! Love these headphones!!!"
5,"They work well, they sound decent, good for a simple basic set of headphones. Works with my android phone and my ipad."
6,I use these for music and gaming! I feel like the volume control on the cord works but not very loud...I usually just use the volume control on my phone (music) or computer(gaming).
7,At first I enjoyed the headphones and had no problem with it but currently after 3 months I can't hear anything from either side of the headphones. One month prior I wasn't able to hear from the right side and I was fine but now I can't hear anything from it when I plugged it into my phone or labtop. Disappointed to say the least. I took great care of the headphones making sure the cord coiled correctly after use. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
8,This is our 2nd pair of these headphones - they work awesome for our 9-year old. She uses them constantly so she wore out one pair and we ordered the exact same ones.
9,"I break a pair of headphones a month because I'm super clumsy. I've used tons of different kinds. I've had a pair of Bose. These are my favorite. The sound is excellent. They get loud, are comfy, and cancel outside sound very well. Bonus: I plugged them into my PS4 controller for quiet gaming at night, and to my surprise, the mic works as a gaming headset."
0,Nice
1,"nice price, nice headphone, pretty good sound."
2,Broke in the first week. Can't hear out of them!
3,love them
4,Just used them a couple of times.so far ok
5,"Quick shipping, work great!"
6,Meh.
7,"I ordered these as they got really good reviews for the price - but when they arrived I was immediately disappointed. The sound is tinny, and distant - zero bass and it sounds like you are listening to music in another room. I contacted the seller because it seemed like my pair was defective, and they said ""just turn it up louder.""

So helpful.

Avoid these."
8,"I listen to a lot of audiobooks and unfortunately, the in-ear buds start to hurt after awhile. I also wanted something I could use in bed and even though I still can't lay on my side with these they work really well. I can push one off of my ear and use the other.

I love how they fold up making them travel really easily. I fold them up and shove them in my purse. I'm really pleased with these. They're comfortable and although they don't go too small, they fit fairly well."
9,I purchased these as a gift soon not know ow they work. Will not know until CHRISTmas!
0,read description carefully
1,No moment. Not my used.
2,"Exactly as described. Wire seems thick and durable, exactly how I wanted it! Sound quality is great, just what I was looking for!"
3,"I bought a pair of really nice headphones in college, but sadly, they did not last very long. I was in desperate need of new headphones and decided to try this AILHEN set out. They were really nicely packaged and easy to open. This product does come with a warranty, which is reassuring, just in case something happens to it. The headphones fold in, making them ready to throw in a purse or backpack. The plugin part comes with a plastic protective piece which is a nice little bonus and very easy to remove. The headphones are very comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. You can just move the ears up and down to your size. I do like that they are padded and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I just wish that they were larger. Most headphones and earbuds have a volume up and down button, this has a slide for volume. It is silent and very easy to use. There is also a play/pause button too that works for music and phone calls too. This is great pair of universal headphones!

I hope that this review has been helpful to you!"
4,"Update: though they broke after 4 months, after posting my review the ailihen customer service team contacted me within a day. They were very apologetic and quickly sent a new pair which are working well.
They come with a good warranty which I didn't realize.
These were great while they lasted. Took into consideration other reviews so we'lre gentle with them. Then not quite for months later the left headphone stopped working. Problem is at the volume switch on cord. It only works when twisted a certain way, which is useless. Very disappointed as these are good looking and my son had loved them."
5,"I would have really loved these except that they stopped working only a few months after I bought them. The cord bent or pinched or something and so the sound is intermittent and I have to hold the cord a certain way and keep moving it around to hear anything. Needless to say, that is not optimal. So while I liked the looks and the level of comfort on my head and ears, I won't buy this product again because it breaks easily."
6,"Decent headphones, but not without issues. The bass is good, but not as good as I wish it would be. The sound overall is good, but not as good as I wish it would be. These are over-the-ear headphones, but they get pinchy after a couple of hours. The padding is comfortable, but the headphone structure itself is not really adjustable, and it sits just slightly askew on your ears, putting pressure points in the wrong spots. The cord is super long and fabric covered, so it seems pretty sturdy. I've only been using these for two weeks though, so I'm not sure how they'll hold up months from now.

Overall, I like these headphones, and they're better than ear buds. These are not top-of-the-line, so don't expect them to be. But for the price, they're a good purchase."
7,"This is a pretty basic set of headphones that do not sound all that great. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear and the cable is long enough for most uses. It also includes a microphone so you can answer a call if using the headphones with your phone.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ SOUND QUALITY ‚óÑ‚óÑ

The sound here is fairly lacking across the board from fairly weak bass to a mid-range and high-end that never quite feel like they're crisp and clear. Listening to various things with these headphones I got the feeling everything was just a bit muffled as the headphones tried to keep up with the music. The sound here might be better than the earbuds that come with most phones but it is not far and beyond better.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ COMFORT ‚óÑ‚óÑ

I am a big guy, at 6'6"" I have a larger than average head. I did have to extend these as far as they would go but once I did they fit comfortably. The earpads are nice and soft and are comfortable to wear.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ CONCLUSION ‚óÑ‚óÑ

The overall sound quality is just not there with this set of headphones. If you really want an over the ear headphone I'd suggest spending a few more dollars and getting something better. If you're ok with earbuds I've tested out plenty of in-ear headphones in the $20 range that blew these away.

Sample provided for review."
8,"I purchased these for my 12yr old son to use for playing music/games on his laptop, tablet, and phone. He wore them one time and stopped using them. I asked him why, because they actually looked nice with a modern tech appearance. My son explained how the headphones didn't fit good on his head and began hurting shortly after putting them on. I decided to try them on myself... and found that the headphones are really stiff on the head. When I say stiff... I mean stiff! There is no horizontal movement built into the earcups whatsoever that would compensate for a more comfortable fit. No matter how I positioned the headphones on my head, there was always a small crack between the earcups and my head... therefore never providing a complete seal around the ear. I gave 2 stars for the appearance and the fact that they did play music, but these headphones need to go back to engineering for re-design."
9,"These headphones do not have good sound quality. They were tinny and the sound was dim. The noise cancelling feature was nice since they fit on the ear, but that didn't make the sound quality any better. I returned these headphones and bought a different pair from a reputable brand."
0,"UPDATE: THEY DIED!! :-( 2/6/2018 About a year and a half of usage and they finally started to fade in an out, the left channel in and out. The mic ended up working really well and no one could tell I was on headphones during a call (iphone) so that was impressive. After about 3 months they broke in a bit better and the mids sounded better. They served their purpose and remained comfortable for their nearly year and a half of usage. They lasted longer than I thought and ended up being pretty comfortable after the break in period 3.5 stars

I bought this for around 10, as running/exercise headphones. Worth it for the gym but if you want to vibe on your lossless audio skip it, don't do it. .

I directly compared these to the sound quality of Monoprice Dj Over the Ears which are the golden standard of bargain headphones.

Extra details:
Headstrap from top of ear cup to top of ear cup is 12"" expandable to 14.5""

Pros:
Good bass when EQ'd, (not heavy, just good)
Soft Comfy Ear Pads
The volume control sticks out a bit which makes it easy to get the correct output level
Cord is sturdy
Nice Color (mint/grey)

Cons
Mids/Highs are muddy, I highs sound like mids.
Top band is thin rubber on hard plastic and uncomfortable
Plastic everywhere!!!
Folding is stiff and feels like I could break them if not careful.

Overall: Bargain beat em up headphones with a bargain sound. After boosting the Bass in EQ settings they sound much fuller and less flat. Sound is muddled with no distinction of lows/mids. It feels cheaply made, which I expected, but I can't find too many weak spots on the construction. They look decent. The ear pads are surprisingly soft and well padded, but the top of the head strap is a bit hard. The clamp of the headphones is adequate for most movements and only slides around a small amount. Monoprice headphones are still leagues better. These are my goto now when I listen to audiobooks or podcasts while working out.

I will post again when these inevitably die. Cheers!"
1,"These would be a five star headphone set if they cancelled out all background noises when having them on, like if I'm watching a tv show on my iPad I can still hear my kids bickering in the background, which I'd prefer not to hear if possible. Other than that they fit comfortably, I really like the way they adjust automatically to your head size so there isn't any playing around with sizing it properly, and all the features are easily accessible and in convienent places. The orange color is a nice solid vibrant color, the cushion on the ear pieces is comfortable for about an hour or so and then I need to take them off for a little bit and give my ears some free space before putting them back on, it does start to irritate my ears after about an hour or so, but most headphones do that so it's definitely not a deal breaker for me. The price has got to be one of the best features about these headphones, as they do multifunction with a mic built in, the fold up, can adjust the volume and skip back and fourth thru music and shows easily with the touch of a button on the headset and not have to access the device, and to do all that, and comfortably with decent sound quality at this price is a steal in my opinon. I'm no expert on sound quality, but it's definitely not bad, especially at this price.
Pros:
Fold up easily, little to no effort
Auto adjust to your head
Cushion comfortable for about an hour at a time
Sound quality about a 7 on a scale of 1-10
Mic option built in
Volume control button as well as fwd/rew
Corded so no running out of battery, and the cord is reinforced at the meet of the cord and headset making it ideal for wear and tear
Durable, have been dropped many times, even stepped on a few times and still together working just as great as day one.
Price is just a deal in my opinon and def worth noting in the pros for this headset with all these great features.

Cons:
Starts to irritate my ears after about an hour or so of wear, but that happens to me on most headsets.
Doesn't have any sort of travel pouch or case to keep them in, which would be nice for when not in use.
The sound quality obviously could be better, but to expect better than what it is, I would expect a significant price increase as well and therefore not really a con to me, but for some it may be with it not cancelling out background noises as well as I had hoped they did.

Overall I would have to say, honestly I'm impressed with these headphones and very happy with them. I would recommend them to my friends, especially for kids/teens since they do appear to be decently durable thus far. I have 4 boys and they have definitely been tested here and there and they still are intact, with nothing broken or damaged and working great still, which is key for me when buying headphones. I did recieve these at a discounted price, in exachage for my honest opinion of them. I'm very happy with this purchase, and was not compensated in anyway to purchase and test this headset out in anyway."
2,"Bottom line up front: The color of these headphones are very cute and will grab the attention of others. I would rate the sound quality as medium and the comfort of these headphones are okay as long as you do not wear them for extended periods of time.

It did not currently own a pair of over-the-ear headphones and wanted to try out a pair. Because of this and the fact that I loved the color, this was perfect product to try out and was very eye-catching at the same time. The following are my thoughts regarding this product.

**Pros
1. Color - The best thing about these headphones is really the bright teal color. The color is very vibrant and will certainly grab your attention.
2. Design - The design of these headphones is quite neat since it does fold into itself. So although this headphones is much more bulky in comparison to earphones it does compress in size based on its folding capability. I also like the packaging that it comes in and would make a perfect gift.
3. Sound - I was not sure whether to make this a pro or con but in the end I do think that the quality matches the list price of this item. You are able to hear the sound fairly clearly however if you listen to music at higher volumes your sound may become slightly distorted. For every day listening however this product will provide you what you're looking for.

**Cons
1. Comfort - This call may be more due to personal preference but I found that overtime the headphones become uncomfortable to wear. It may be due to the shape of my ear trying to conform to the headphones but I find that after more then half an hour, my ears start to hurt. You may not have this issue but depending on the shape of your ear, this became an issue with this particular headphones.

Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discount however this does not influence my review of this item in anyway. I do come back and update my review if the there is anything that I missed that was not identified in my initial review.

Please indicate below if this review was helpful."
3,"The bottom line first: I would not buy these again.

Broke in three months, after very light use. Bought them in January, tried to return them in March, but they are no longer returnable.

Used them for a few business calls on skype and to listen to music on the phone. The microphone still works (people can hear me on skype) but there is no sound coming out of the speakers. I've bought lots of headphones, expensive and inexpensive, and these have been by far the least-lasting.

In terms of the design - my hair gets caught in the adjusting mechanism and I've lost a few strands that way. Other designs adjust higher up which don't pull my hair.

Review updated on June 3 2017 - Alihen sent me a new pair. Change from 1 star to 4 for excellent customer service. I still think there are better designs out there."
4,"So packaging first.. The AILIHEN C8 Headphones came in a nice looking retail display package, which surprised me. Based on the price, I was assuming that they would arrive in a plain cardboard box or inside of a plastic bag.

I excitedly opened up the box and checked the headphones out. The headphones seemed to be made to a decent quality. They fit on my head well and adjust easily. The earphones indeed have a decent amount of cushioning on them. The cord measures approximately 5 foot in length, which was long enough to put my iPhone inside of my pant pocket. I then plugged the headphones into my iPhone; the sound quality was rather good. I really did not expect the headphones to sound satisfactory at all, but they actually sound as good as my last way pair that was way more expensive. The cord has almost like a shoelace texture to it, and feels less likely to tangle up than a standard rubber cord. They have a microphone that I haven‚Äôt tested yet so can‚Äôt comment on that. They also have a volume control, which I have used and can say that it worked on my iPhone 5s. The headphones stayed put on my head comfortably as I roamed the house doing my chores.

My Final Verdict : I was simply looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones to wear while watching tv or to listen to music on my iPhone. I‚Äôm so glad that I found these AILIHEN C8 Headphones, which look pretty similar to beats headphones at just a fraction of the price. Now I really wasn‚Äôt expecting much from these headphones, but they actually impressed me considering the price. Awesome deal considering the price!

5,"Used this bag for 3 days. 2 three subject notebooks, 4 single subject books and one pencil pouch. The top handle is already tearing apart. The sides are not sewn together well, coming apart at seams. Not happy at all!!!"
6,"The sound quality was awesome . I got this headset set for one of my little nephews . Theres 3 of them ( all brothers ) and they love playing video games . But when you play online you need a microphone in order to be able to communicate with other players to be able to accomplish the missions and tasks ,etc. Well they only had the regular little headphones that go in your ear before and couldn't communicate with anyone so they kept getting frustrated. Thats where i came in . I came across this headset on amazon and knew i just had to get some for them. I ordered a few different kinds but must admit that the lime green ones were the coolest ones i ordered. It was simple enough for them to be able to figure out how to use the mic . And they fold compactly so they don't take up much space. The cord was well made and made with a braided fabric material over the cord so its very durable and it was very long a lot longer than i had expected it to be . They are very good quality considering that you get them for an awesome price. Well worth the price in my opinion. Theres a lot of cushion around the ears and they cancel out excess noise well. Theres also a small about 1/2 in strip of soft material as cushion for the head to make them more comfortable for wearing them for hours at a time .They look much better in person and shine alot . My camera couldn't seem to capture that aspect of them. Sorry about that. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It did not in anyway change my opinion on the product. This is simply my own personal experience while testing out the product. This discount does not affect whether or not i give a good or bad review in any way . I have gotten free items in the past and still given bad reviews because thats how i honestly felt about a product."
7,"Comfort: 5/5
These headphones are comfy to wear, block out a lot of outside sounds, and don't overheat your ears. I wore them for hours on end, listening to jazz while reading on the beach.

Controls: 3/5
This headset has a mechanical slider for volume control. To my surprise, it never got accidentally nudged all week. It's stiff enough not to shift just from moving around. I can't say what happens if you take these jogging, but when I mow the lawn next weekend, I'll see if that causes the slider to shift. It doesn't adjust the volume on my phone - just the headset. That has its pros and cons, but mostly cons.

Sound Quality: 2.5/5
The sound is a bit tinny, and there's not a lot of bass. It's noticeably low-end. By contrast, I used it for audiobooks, and the mid-range clarity was very good. Also, the cushions isolate the sound very well, so you get less outside interference. That's a pro. If your top priority is sound quality, go with something pricier / higher end.

Appearance: 5/5
These look pretty slick. I'm not a fashion guru, but I like the look.

Convenience/Folding: 5/5
I have 3 sets of folding headphones, and these are the best. They don't fold super small (not like jeans pocket small) but you could stow them in a large purse, or in my case, a beach bag, easily. They are quick and easy to fold, unlike the Skullcandy ones I have.

Durability: 5/5
These stood up to high winds, sand, and wet hair pretty well. They were kicked around by a toddler, baby, and preschooler. They were shoved in an over-packed car twice and made it out alive. They took a beating and were unfazed. They FEEL pretty tough, too.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I spent a week testing them at the beach in the outer banks, just to report back on them."
8,"I purchased the black/orange version of these headphones as a surprise gift for my young adult daughter. I knew she was in need of new ear buds or headphones and because this set also features a microphone and can answer phone calls I knew she would really appreciate it. I was right! She absolutely loves these headphones! The sound quality and clarity when making or taking phone calls is actually pretty impressive.

These have a really sleek, modern design. The cable is braided and seems to be of high quality. I actually purchased a similar set of headphones around this same price point for my son at the same time as I purchased these, the only difference being that his doesn't feature the microphone and volume control. After trying them both, this pair of headphones definitely edges out the other we purchased in comfort and overall sound quality. These also do a better job of blocking outside noise. I appreciate that they fold up nicely, which is great for transporting, packing, and on-the-go.

Overall, this is a pretty great little set of headphones. Audio quality is impressive and they are super comfortable. My son always needs to ""give his ears a break"" after wearing his similar headphones for a couple of hours, but my daughter doesn't with these as the fit and padding is better.

9,"AILIHEN C8 lightweight foldable headphones. they are package in a gray box with a clear front to display these very cool looking neon green headphones along with the manufacturer name and detailed specifications clearly written on the box. Inside the box are a nice looking pair of headphones. I received the neon green ones .What I like a lot about these headphones is one wire controls both speakers and the wire is braided so it‚Äôs less likely to tangle up .The speakers are adjustable to about 1 ¬Ω inches and have a thick padding to cover your ears The headphones have a rotating and folding design which makes storing or carrying around a little easier.These headphones deliver a clear hifi sound with a strong bass and block out noise that's around you, I personally listen to hard rock and rap music and the bass delivers to my standards and for my obligation to test and write a honest review I listened to some classical and easy listening music and you can hear every instrument clear and precise .Finally I plugged into my computer tower to play some games and the headphones did not disappoint me, the AILIHEN C8 stereo headphones sound very good with the volume on low or turned up. I was very impressed and plan to purchase a pair for my daughter. My final though is, these headphones are average size but comfortable and they are collapsiblie with a single nylon wire which I like, and for around $20.00 you are getting a good deal ."
0,"These AILIHEN C8 headphones can play your music LOUD! I found myself quickly turning the sound on my computer down from where I normally have it when using my ear buds.

The padding is very nice, and the fit on my head is snug. I personally would like it to be looser, I want to feel like there is nothing on my head, but I may be asking for too much there. The snug fit allows this set to work for children as young as a tween, up to men with moderate sized heads. They do stretch quiet wide if needed, but the length might of how far the ear pieces come down may not work for a very large head. On my head, which I hope is moderate, it fits fine and snugly and still has a small amount of slide left in how much lower the ear piece could go down.

Really everything about these headphones, aside from wanting them looser, is just awesome. I hope it helps you decide if these are what you are looking for.

We have 6 people in the house who use earphones frequently. I ordered this pair for one of my sons since his favorite color is green and it makes it easy to color code belongings. They have a good sound quality and feel comfortable on the head. They are not the type that go completely over the ear but they are well padded. The set has some nice deep tones and have been working well. No complaints.

2,"***EDITED*** One side stopped producing sound not long after I posted my original review.....

I will update this review should I experience any problems. I am pleased with these overall so far. That being said, I am only using them to listen to shows I watch on my Kindle Fire. So as far as actual sound quality goes, I can't really attest to that. The one con that I did notice immediately that could be a huge issue for some people is that these headphones are not at all adjustable. Originally, I thought my 7 y/o might be able to use them with the school's iPad, but they'd be too big to stay on her head. I do notice less sound coming from the right side, but I've noticed that with other headphones as well, and am unsure if they're supposed to be that way or if I have a hearing problem. I really like how these headphones fold up when not in use; however, they are still bulky. I don't expect them to last for very long as it is obvious they are of a cheaper quality. I do feel that the listed price for these headphones is too high. I don't think they should cost more than $10. They also don't come with instructions, but they arrive boxed up very well."
3,"I really love these headphones! I've been using them every night for about two months now and they are perfect for my needs.

I listen to ASMR videos on YouTube every night as I'm falling asleep so trust me when I say they are super comfortable. More than half the time, I wake up listening to nothing but leave the headphones on because it's comforting to me. I know that's a tad weird but hey, whatever works right? The padding on the ears is great and I wipe them down with just a tad of Purell once a week just to keep them nice a clean.

The sound is great and I like that I can adjust them on the headphones themselves as well as whatever device I'm using. I have the headphones turned all the way up and then adjust the volume on my device. I've used these while on the phone with my husband and he says my voice is more clear when using the microphone on these headphones.

I didn't pay attention when I purchased these so I was happily surprised when I saw that it had a braided cord! My old head phones got trashed because the wires and little bits of fuzz were starting to poke out of the cord. This won't happen with these!!

I ordered the grey and teal color. The color is beautiful and just as pictured. They are super cute!

When my hair is up in a bun I can extend them a bit and they still fit great. I wouldn't say this size is for toddlers but older kids maybe 10 and up will have no problem wearing them.

The folding feature is cool and will come in handy for a big move we have coming up. When folded they fit nicely in the car door or even my purse.

When my husband came home he liked mine so much I ordered him his own pair!!

I definitely recommend this headphones and have already purchased two pairs now. I think these would make a great gift for a music lover or really anyone who prefers the classic over the ear style headphones."
4,"Got it yesterday and so far I love them! I originally ordered them because I have a crap pair that hurt my ears when I want to watch with my noisey family around, but this pair is more than I expected. First, they got here fast. Secondly, the sound is so good and the ear parts don't hurt my ears after several shows on Netflix. Thirdly, They're cool as heck. The fold up feature is awesome, the texture of the cord is like a shoelace, the volume part on the cord actually controls the volume while watching (unlike my crap pair), and they seem durable like they will last! 10/10 so far, good job with this one."
5,First off I love the color orange so 1 point right off the bat. ALIHEN folding stereo headset headphones work wonders when you want the full head phone experience on the go. I ordered these specifically because I seen that they were a folding headset and there were many times that I wanted to take my larger headphones with me where I was going but decided against it because they were too bulky to carry around. The ones I ordered were in blue and I was very happy with the design and look of the headphones. They seems to be well made and not cheap and easily breakable which I was happy with. They are partially plastic and partially metal and it gives them a very cool look. One thing that really impressed me was the fact that the cord was very strong and had a cloth covering over it instead of the normal plastic or rubber coating. This makes them much more durable and I like that because I am very rough with the things I use. The sound is awesome there is complaints about that and the microphone also works just as well. Overall I couldn't find 1 bad thing about these so I gave it a 5 out 5 . Disclaimer: I purchased these orange headphones with a promotional voucher for a fair and unbiased opinion. Everything expressed in this review is based off my experience using the product.
6,"I bought the headphones for my daughter's birthday and she really likes them. She basically chose them due to the bright green color that matches her phone. The head band is adjustable and the part that covers the ear is softly cushioned and very comfortable. This headset works nicely with Iphone or a Droid phone. (I tried them with both.) The sound quality is very good. When wearing the headphones and listening to music, it is difficult to hear what someone is saying to you. That is a pro not a con. The headphones seem to be a nice quality set and my daughter uses them daily."
7,"These headphones sounded okay when they worked - but they stopped working after a couple of months. Slowly, the sound got scratchy when moving the cord around and then the sound started going out completely on one side and they are now totally not usable. This seems like a big waste of money for headphones that lasted 4 months with only occasional use. I emailed customer service at Ailihen - we shall see how they respond and I will update the review based on the response."
8,"Have had this for a few months now and purposely have waited to report on the quality/worthiness of this set of headphones. Brought these for my 9 year old daughter and although she is pretty careful with her stuff, I've notice the cable does get tangled up from time to time. So far, no problem. She likes the sound quality (and I've checked them out as well and they are very good.) Seem to be well built and I especially appreciate the way the headphone are attached to the head piece. I think these will last just as long or longer than previous sets we have gotten for her. I have them saved on my wish list and will buy them again, if the occasion comes up."
9,"These headphones were a great price and I like the way they look. Works very well for phone calls. I would have liked the volume control on the headset to work differently. I had previous headphones sets where if the volume was on low, it was the same volume as the device it was plugged into. This set, if you lower the volume, there is none - so it definitely is not loud enough for me when listening to speech files, etc. for work."
0,"Great product at an awesome price. The sound quality is great and they are very stylish. I love the color. They are comfortable and can be stored away in small spaces, since they fold. I would have given 5 stars, but this product does not work with my Amazon Kindle Fire.I assumed that it would work.(My fault, I should never assume anything. I forgot that.) Since it is combatable with so many devices, I thought it would work with that too. I use my Kindle a lot, so that is a disappoint. Overall, it is a great product. It was delivered fast, securely, and safely."
1,"For the price, these are a decent pair of cans. I needed something to wear at work that could also be used to make calls and I didn't want a pair of earbuds. These have good sound quality, especially considering the price point,and the Mic provides decent voice quality for calls. My only gripe is they do get a bit uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them, the headband squeezes my head a little too tightly and my ears get a little sore."
2,"We have had this item for two months. It worked great for a little over a month, now it has static and the sound goes out in one of the ears randomly. We love the look and over all feel of these headphones, but the quality is lacking for the price."
3,"Be prepared to return these. They worked for the first few times we used them, then the sound became muffled and vocals could not be heard. Also, when folded, the headphones do not stay put. Instead they kind of dangle. Pay just $6 more the the Sound Intone headphones. We've had those for a month and are super happy we purchased that brand instead."
4,"This review will be broken down into pro's and con's to expedite effectiveness of review.

PRO'S:
- Product arrived in timely manner
- Design of product is nice. Colors are bright and vibrant.
- Cord is hidden within the extension of the headband for the most part.
- Extension of headphones are adequate.
- Cord is of almost shoelace material, providing unique but pleasant texture and support over strenuous wear and tear use vs other cord materials.

CON'S:
- Sound leakage: This product has terrible sound conditioning. Any bystander can easily hear what you are listening if volume is at a high level. Even with headphones on head, the sound can still be heard and nice loud volumes. User must turn down music to really escape any sound leakage, but that defies the point of listening to a headset with music/gaming.

- Material: While the headband is cushioned for mitigating any discomfort, the product gets extremely uncomfortable after long duration. Tried for 2 hours and ears were hot, and sore afterwards. Extremely uncomfortable to wear.

- Sound: Bass is terrible, even at loud volumes, sound is extremely hollow and faint. Mixed music produced same results."
5,"My Ailihen C8 headphones arrived earlier than expected which is always nice. I gave 3 stars due to the fact that I have had these headphones for less than a month and the sound sometimes goes in and out or has a strange static sound. I have noticed this on multiple devices (my HP laptop, Android phone, car CD player) so I can only assume it's an issue with this product and not my devices. But for the cost they aren't bad.

I love the style, color, foldable over the ear parts, and that you can manipulate the volume from the cord. Speaking of the cord I love that it's fabric and not just a plastic cord which I have found tangles, tears and damages much easier."
6,"ok so I've had the chance to use these headphones a few times at the gym. So far on the elipitcal , treadmill and just casually sitting at homeThey fit comfortably and have an adjustable band. They are designed very sleek so I do not look totally stupid walking around with big huge headphones. I use them at night to watch tv while hubby sleeps. The noise canceling is o.k but occasionally I would get a feedback type buzz. All and all these are a good value keeping in mind they are not ""Beats"" or ""Bose"". I have used them only for a short time now and will update my review if anything drastically change As an active person I felt this fit right into the type of product I can review with experience with similar products"
7,"Headphones,AILIHEN C8 Lightweight Foldable Headphones with Microphone and Volume Control for iPhone,iPad,iPod,Android Smartphones,PC,Laptop,Mac,Tablet,Headphone Headset for Music Gaming(Grey/Green) by Ailihen

This is a really nice pair of headphones that are working really well for me and my family. They produce some pretty great sounds that are very clear with no static or hissing even when turned all the way up. They are made well and the cable is nice and thick and attached to the earbuds really well. I have no problem plugging the 3.5 mm jack into my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my wife's iPhone 6, even with a case on. They fit my ears nice and are comfortable to wear even for long periods of time without causing any types of ear aches or pains. It has inline controls for playing or pausing the music. The headphones also fold up so they are easy to store or travel with. Love these headphones.

I am a fan of the mid sized over ear headphones. These fold down for storage and have a nice braided cord with an in line volume control and a single button that functions as your home button on an I phone but also plays/pauses and answers calls. There is an in line mic as well that has decent audio quality as well. I appreciate the low profile 3.5 jack that fits around cell phone cases. Sound wise these work out well with clear highs, appropriate mids and, tight punchy lows. The low lows are not completely there but overall the soundscape works well. These wear comfortably. I will be using these for my kids tablets mostly. I hate having to mess with Bluetooth pairing for them and the cords just work.
I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them.I got the Lime Green and Grey colored headphones and they match the online pictures perfectly in color and design.

I purchased this product at a discount / free for me to test and review. I am not affiliated with this company and make no promises of a good rating while reviewing the product. I test the product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions."
8,"I Love this! Very nice...This is cool.Perfect for me.. having away from home I can use this not only for gaming but can use perfectly through skype with the built-in Microphone.
-Headphone is just right its not hurting in the ear..its so smooth, foldable and it's too easy for me to bring anywhere.
-The color is so natural and nice so pleasing on the eyes.
-Even the design and the making of this headphone is remarkable. very fashionable.
-So easy to used compatible to my Samsung Galaxy Note4, MP4 and even in laptop
-Its so hands-free can received my call not holding my phone... the volume is so loud and clear with the adjustment of volume you desired.
- Highly recomednded. Perfect for gift. Received this product with discount"
9,"Lightweight delight. While some reviewers worried these may be too small, I find them perfect for me at the smallest head setting. They block outside sound well. I like the non-kinking braided cord in a gray color that won't show dirt. The ""mint"" is more of a vibrant teal and I love it. I'm not an audio expert, but have used headphones to listen to music for years and these deliver better tone than others in this price range. And while I did not buy these for phone call use, they work well for that, too."
0,"I bought these for my daughter who has managed to break three or four pairs of headphones with what seems to be ""normal"" eight-year-old use. So far, they seem to be solid. Mostly I like that they fold up, so they are less likely to suffer the accidental fate of the others.
We tested with a laptop, android phone, and iPad; no problems with any of the devices."
1,"I have been through many pairs of headphones and earbuds, trying to find something comfortable. I had several pairs of Sony earbuds found in store for $8 that are super comfortable and have decent sound, but they were dropped and broke. So I was in need of a good inexpensive pair for Netflix and Pandora. I got this pair for $9.99, so I thought it was a great deal. They look adorable. They seem good quality. I like the design and the cord. The sound quality is very good and they are doing a great job at noise-cancelling. I love the color and I have to admit that it was a deciding factor, since I love anything teal. I bought the mint/grey ones, but they are not mint. They are teal. I think they got color names a bit mixed up. Anyway, I love the color. The biggest issue is they are extremely uncomfortable. I cannot even wear them for 30 minutes without my ears hurting really, really bad. I do not have huge ears or a big head. I am petite and proportionate, so I don't know what the problem is. It seems to me that they might be designed for children. If the headset was slightly bigger, it would probably be comfortable. I was unsure whether to return them or not, but I figured for $9.99, why bother. I can use them for short term, like to watch short youtube videos or listen to a song or two. I will keep looking for a perfect pair in the meantime."
2,These headphones work well. They do not cancel out all of the sound but they do a good job. I can still slightly hear things close to me. The sound quality is great and everything sounds like it should. I use these daily and I would purchase these again. These you would make a great gift for anyone.
3,"Update: They stopped working properly. I returned them. I guess they weren't so durable after all.
They seem to have decent sound quality. The earpieces block noise but that makes it more difficult to hear someone speaking to me more often than it helps me hear music. Cord is durable and has a volume control and play/pause button, so that's good."
4,"I love them. Before I purchased I read the reviews about being comfortable and the great audio sound, the audio is wonderful however no two ears are the same. They are somewhat comfy for an hour or so but I wouldn't fall asleep in them. But like I say all ears are shaped differently. Other than that I love them as well as having the volume switch on them verses going to my device."
5,"These were for my son and he has only been using them for a few days, but we've tested the functions and overall are very happy with the purchase. The cord covering not being plastic or silicone coated is great because it doesn't get wrapped around itself and tangled up so easily. The microphone works well and I was able to hear him clearly when we did a test video call. The volume adjuster on the mic piece is nice to quickly adjust. They fit well and are comfortable for him. Here's 9.
My husband also bought a pair for himself and he has enjoyed them so far so well."
6,"Having used them for several days now, I like them. My only concerns are, will the ear foam break down and peel, will the controls fail, and will the cord break. These issues will only show up over time so I just have to wait and see. So far I like them."
7,"These headphones are great! Sounds quality is awesome for the low price. I am a college student who attends online, so I use then to submit my oral assignments, microphone works great and I always have a clear audio for my work. Super cute style and color!! I am in love!!"
8,"Quality is amazing. Well built and of great durability. Sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, as well as very comfortable. Noise cancellation is well above average. When headphones are on, you cannot hear anything but what is played through the speakers. As well, when the sound is up inside the headphones, those around cannot hear in the same room unless you are sitting literally right beside them and that is with them up quite loud. They are adjustable. The cord has a mic on it so that you can answer your cell phone when listening to music on your phone. They go up, maybe a little too loud, as my son could potentially do damage to his eardrums. The bass is fantastic, the clarity is phenomenal, and the treble is perfect with great balance. The mids are good, the lows are good, and the highs are good. I literally have nothing bad to say about these headphones. I have ordered three different pair this week of over the ear headphones for under $30 and these are by far the best ones. I just cannot say enough about the sound quality. Even when speaking normally during a phone conversation, my voice is not muffled and neither is the caller on the other end. You definitely cannot go wrong with these headphones. Although I received a discount for my review of this product, I, as many other Amazon shoppers, rely heavily on the un-biased opinions of other reviewers. This review is an un-biased, 100% accurate review of my personal experience with this product."
9,"These headphones are only okay. The pros are they work like headphones should and the sound quality isn't bad for $20.00. It's mostly mids, but it's tolerable. The cons are they are made from cheap materials and a possible fire hazard. I assume many products are made cheaply and sold for more, but when it's obvious the materials are cheap it makes one nervous (light plastic). Especially since the poorly translated English warnings mention possible fire (when plugged into a phone adapter on airplanes). So uh...I won't be plugging these in to my phone anytime soon or taking them on airplanes, but I'll keep them as a throw away pair until I can afford something better.

EDIT: I changed my review to 2 stars because they are now BROKEN after 2 months. I've barely used them and the sound has gone out in the right side. I can't even return them now. You get what you pay for, but it's not worth the risk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
0,"Upgrade from earbuds!! Bought for my daughter, she LOVES them!
I got these for my ten year old daughter who likes to listen to music and is a novice gamer. When she first spotted the headphones right out of the box, she loved the bright, fun colors; but then she put them on and she really fell in love! She loves how comfortable they are, and more importantly how they muffle the background noise of her siblings so that she can enjoy her music and gaming experiences without the sounds of toddlers interrupting her. She also likes how easily the menu bar on the cable operates; she notes that its simple, easy to reach, and allows for all the functions she needs to access whether its pausing her music, answering her phone or skipping ahead to her favorite song. I love that her music helps her focus and that she has been able to work more efficiently on her homework when she's not distracted by outside racket! I also love that the headphones fold to store away easily in their box!
Important to note: these headphones fit really great on my daughter, but when I tried them on, they felt a little small on my ears. I highly recommend for younger (teen - pre-teen) / smaller folks but would buy something larger for myself. The headphones do cover my whole ear, but I personally prefer the kind that encase my ears completely.
* I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am under no obligation to write a positive review and only review after fully testing the product"
1,Nice headphones for priceless. Comfy and sound good. Until 2 days after return window closes. Then month old headset has short in cord near plug. So that sound comes and goes. Better off buy something last more than just long enough they won't stand behind it
2,"Dear AILIHEN, I am very disappointed to inform you that I purchased these lovely headphones and they worked beautifully for the first three weeks. Then the plastic adapter broke and they no longer work. My Mother had bought the same ones (the only difference was the color) and she loved them as well. When I saw mine had broke I looked at hers and noticed that her adapter was metal and solid, where as mine was cheap plastic and broken in less then a month."
3,"I bought these for my son. He loves them he said they are super comfortable the sound is really good and they cancel out alot of noise!
UPDATE sound always goes out after a couple weeks, we have replaced them 2x already.It was a waste of money we now have to buy yet another pair of headphones"
4,These work great and they look good. They aren't noise canceling - but I didn't expect them to be. These are good for listening to Netflix or music or for conferences over Zoom. I've recorded a few lectures on these as well and they sound fine.
5,"After spending all night on the road with these headphones (Vacation baby!) I have to say these headphones are OK at best. The look sleek from a distance, but the silver color on them just LOOKS like cheap plastic. They feel like a toy but are somewhat comfortable. The colors are really nice but I am not quite sure i can tell my friends to pick them up. The looks are ok, the feel is not. The sound quality is OK but i get the same sound quality out of a cheap pair of 5 dollar earbuds from walmart.

These are OK at best.

Disclaimer: I was provided a discount in order to review this product"
6,"Bought for tween daughter who was thrilled with them as they do look great. Unfortunately, only a month later the sound began to falter, strangely couldn't hear vocals any longer, just the music. Then one earphone failed completely and we haven't used them since. Switched to angled earbuds too for more comfort as after a while her ears would be sore from these."
7,"Our young son is fairly picky about how headphones feel on his ears when wearing them. We ordered these headphones last year and he has really liked them! He needed a new pair for school this year so we made sure to purchase the same kind. We really like that there is padding on the part that sits on your ears, that the cord is covered in a nylon fabric (does not get tangled) and that the headphones fold easily. They are great for traveling!"
8,"I bought these July 18, 2016 for my son's birthday and he loved them using them while playing games on his tablet. But it is now December 18, 2016 (5 months later!) and there is only sound every once in a while in one side and that's only after messing with the volume slide for a while. VERY disappointed. They are going in the trash."
9,Captians Log...Star date 1/23/2017...My headphones arrived recently and I have found myself intrigued by the product. Good product. Just what I expected for the money. Delivered quickly and in great shape when they arrived. Would buy again. Kirk out...
0,"I received these headphones on October 6th 2016. These headphones are beautiful and seem sturdily constructed, as far as the body goes. That is where the positive aspects end. They do not work for someone with a big head. They are too snug. Even worse they pinch my ears terribly. I have pretty small ears maybe even smaller than most adult women and though the ear pieces are very padded they pinch badly, especially if I am wearing glasses. This is not due to the band size but something in the ear cups construction. Now the review gets worse... The sound initially was very muffled and quiet, I noticed the only way to get these things sounding reasonably loud enough was to hold down the talk button or at-least I am assuming that is what the little knobby button is as its unlabeled. Then the sound was clear. But the button does not stay depressed so you either have to hold it or find a way to gently secure it... So you can hear your audio, their sole function. I should have returned these off the bat because of the discomfort issue but I didn't, now they have forced my hand and they will go to the great dumpster in the sky. Both speakers have gone out, I struggled with one side working for about a week and today the remaining speaker has died. RIP headphones you were terrible but will be missed.... only because now I don't have any working headphones."
1,This product is very durable. Even the cord is wrapped in a wonderful fabric that is usually the point at which she sings fail. I keep this next to my living room chair so I can quietly listen to things on my computer without disturbing family members nearby
2,The jack broke off in the ear phone slot not even a week after we bought them! Very sad about the quality of this product.
3,"Amazing sound quality!! I got these at a special price. I think like $13.99 or something like that. If i see it for this price again, I'm definitely getting another one. I still have my N-Tune Headphones but it seem like the sound quality on this is a little bit better in my opinion. Well, to me sound quality is different for everyone. Some people like loads of bass and some people like a little bass with more treble. Anyways, just got them today and i hope they at least last a year or more. Love it!!"
4,It was just what I was looking for. The ear covers are much more comfortable than the ones I previously had. The color is very close to the color on my computer screen. I especially love the working volume slider. I still get head aches but that's usually due to how I wear them not because of wearing them in general.
5,"These headphones are great! Clear sound, no problems with the cord, comfortable and adjustable headphones. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones. It is a little odd that the cord is on the left, but not a deal breaker."
6,After two days the jack that goes into my daughter tablet broke off into the jack insert in her tablet now her tablet is damaged since I don't know how to get the jack out of it. Now I have a three hundred dollar tablet that you can't hear any sound. Very upset!!
7,"These headphone are nice, but not very comfortable for long use. I really don't recommend these. If you are wanting something quick then go for these but look for others. They started to hurt my ears some after a few days. To me they seem cheap, not will designed. My headphones broke. I was only getting sound out of one site and not both. I am extremely unhappy with the product. I also don't want to pay the extra costs of shipping them back. I do not recommend these headphones at all. Look at other headphones don't get these."
8,"The headphones looked high end but they weren‚Äôt. The headphone jack ended up breaking in my daughter‚Äôs iPhone so now the phone believes headphones are in so now you can‚Äôt get any calls. She can‚Äôt hear people. Headphones just not built to last, cheap and when you buy cheap you get what you pay forüëè"
9,"Pretty, functional, sound great and are comfortable. I like that they fold and fit nicely in the case (bought separately). Can't hear much around me when wearing them. They block outside noise very well."
0,"they were good headphones for about 5 months, until suddenly on a phone they would start pausing, unpausing, skipping, and opening siri by itself with no way to stop it. they worked fine on the computer until the audio wouldn't work unless you positioned the cord a certain way, and then it only played out of one side and then they stopped working completely!! so yeah i'm pretty pissed right now"
1,I purchased a pair for my daughter and a pair for my son. My daughter‚Äôs cord broke after a few weeks and I returned for a refund. My sons just recently stopped working for u known reason and now the window has closed to return it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting Beats or Bose but was hoping they would last longer then a few months.
2,"I have a few VR headsets, from simple Google cardboard to plastic headsets. This is a step above the standard Google Cardboard, in the same class as SamsungVR. If you aren't aware of Google Cardboard it is a neat little gadget that takes the price of the VR experience down from $800-$1,000 to a manageable price for a non-essential gadget. While this was on the way I thought it would take a long setup time and be cumbersome and require special hardware to run properly that I didn't have. Turns out nearly any phone can run this and setup is as easy as scanning a QR code and downloading the app. In the future I see VR playing a role in education and instruction as it allows you to get up close and personal with historical events, animals, planets, in a way you may never have been able to before."
3,"Stopped working after 1 week, light usage. Terrible mic/ audio quality"
4,"Super cute colors, I use them to watch tv on my iPad so they work great for my purposes. They‚Äôre a little bit tight on my head though, so if I wear them for a while they start to hurt."
5,"I ordered these from my daughters wish list for her birthday on 4-3. She was so happy because they are also noise canceling, something she needed for a college class she is taking."
6,"I have had these headphones for 6 months. I though I'd give them a try because of the reviews; I was wrong. The microphone and the right ear-piece stopped working after a month of use. Unfortunately, and coincidently, it was right after the return service ended. Save your money and buy something else!"
7,"I bought these for Christmas presents for my 2 & 7 year old daughters. They have used them from December through now (mid March). One set had the ""plug"" become detached when it was being pulled out from the headphone jack of our iPad & the other just no longer works. They didn't even last 3 months.

I did give 2 stars because I do like the concept of the folding headphones & being able to pause/control the volume on them as well."
8,Super high quality! I love the look and feel of these headphones. The sound quality is awesome and the headphones have a noise cancelling quality to them. They are great for the gym!
9,"My 9 year old daughter received these as a Christmas present. She opened them on December 27th and on 12/29 the one side of the headphones didn't work. On 1/1 the jack plug broke in half. She's careful with her electronics and keeps them put away when not in use. She's very disappointed that they didn't last more than week. My sister in law wasted her money on this product. My other children's ""kid"" head phones are still going strong with a lower price point."
0,These headphones are comfortable and sound great. The mic works very well also. This is the best set of headphones I own and I use them every day. I can't imagine anyone needing anything better
1,I like the headphones. It is larger than I thought it would be.I wanted it to hang behind my neck. the product does exactly what it is supposed to. I love the cord for the headphones they are not easily broken.
2,these headphones are horrible the same day i got them they started shorting. they are very cheap and aren't reliable. disappointment.
3,The ear pad came off after 6 months of light use. Short product life.
4,"I ordered 2, first one broke within a couple weeks. The seller replaced and sent me another one, sadly both of those broke within a matter of weeks. Definitely not durable and NOT KID FRIENDLY."
5,"I received these headphones as a gift from my older sister for Christmas. At the time, I was living in a dorm room with really noisy people, so these headphones helped me a lot. It doesn't block outside noise completely, but with music on, it helps. Unfortunately, the headphone jack got bent. So my sister contacted Ailihen and they gave me a new pair completely free. I love these headphones, and they are so cute!! And the customer service is really nice. I think what happened to my old headphones was just a fluke, so don't worry!"
6,"I bought these headphones which were delivered Jan 30. After only two months, the cord shorted out and they stopped working. I tried to message the seller to ask for a refund or replacement but received no reply, i wasted my money on these poor quality headphones. Buyer beware!"
7,"These headphones are very comfortable and lightweight, with great sound. I love the durability of the cord, it looks to be one that should last. I have only used them a handful of time so so far, but am quite happy with my purchase. Especially since the price was go great!"
8,Broke within a week of receiving
9,"Sound is ok. Very lightweight. BUT, no removable cord at the earpiece means broken cord that you can't fix without taking the whole kit apart.

For that reason alone-- I say stay away. I bought a different set for my son-- the wire broke-- and I just replaced it. simple."
0,"Love these and so does my 6 year old! We have used these for several months and really enjoyed them. Sound quality is good, volume control is easy for my kiddo to operate and comfortable on. The fold up feature is nice for storing."
1,"Bought these for my 5 and 7 year old boys. They were so excited to get them. They look great. They have very impressive sound quality. Both boys have been constantly wearing them for the past week. They must do a good job drowning out sound because they can't hear us when they are on...not that they would come running before when we called them! They are a little big on my 5 year old but he doesn't seem to mind. Mainly got them for plane ride, but haven't left yet, not confident they will work great. Highly recommend"
2,"I bought three of these headphones for my kids. twin 11 and 9 year olds. All failed the same way. They worked when we got them and the kids liked them, but one pair failed within weeks, the second pair a month later and the third shortly after that. The first started with one ear stopping to work, then eventually no sound at all."
3,"Great headphones. Got them for both of my boys (tween and teen). They love them. The foldability is a nice feature. Also the cord is more like a fabric nylon, so I imagine that will hold up well to the rigors of teen boy product testing."
4,"Amazing quality for the price!. The noise canceling aspect makes them great for studying and the wire is braided so it wont bend easily. Also I love how they bend easily to fit in my bag.
My only issue is it fits a little snug around the ears, but that is more of a personal preference.

Update: I lost sound in the right ear after a month and now the right hinge broke off...Its to late to return but overall its not as great as I first thought"
5,"I bought these headphones for my daughter and they broke with in a few weeks. The end piece broke off inside the laptop. Apparently, this is common for these headphones. Do NOT waste your money."
6,The sound quality for the price is phenomenal and better than Beats (not that that is difficult to do). The microphone is weak and in a bad location but it's decent audio.
7,"Got for daughter. Worked for about 6 months. Then the Bluetooth stopped working, then the cushion on the right side cane off."
8,The color of these headphones is just gorgeous! I just wish the bass was stronger and the overall volume was a little louder instead of me having to jack up the volume on my phone.
9,"I‚Äôve had these for just about a year now, and they‚Äôre holding up well! The only issue I have is that I wish the parts that cover the ear were a little bigger or shaped differently or something. After a while, my left ear sometimes gets sore because the padding rubs against my cartilage piercing."
0,"I don't know how ppl are giving good reviews. Mine suck. The little controller on the chord is way too sensitive, making static, and ruining the music every time the chord it even slightly touched. Pretty frustrated, and disappointed."
1,I have worn these headphones for almost six hours straight and they haven't hurt my ears. I do have smaller ears and they are sensitive so I really needed something other than earbuds as they tend to make my ears ache. I also get headaches really easy from wearing anything like headbands or snug sunglasses and these haven't caused any problems. They aren't tight but don't flop off my head either. The sound quality is good. Decent bass and the volume can be turned up very loud. No issues with outside noise or having to turn it up in loud areas. I can't even turn it all the way up or it's too loud. They have a real nice look to them as well. I really like the volume control. The mic works great for phone calls. Very good product!
2,I've had hear for maybe 2 weeks and they just fell apart as I was heading out of the door. No man handling in my part I literally lifted them off of my table. Don't waste your money just buy reliable like the $20 Sony - I bought mostly for the color and now I'm paying for it.
3,My whole family is enjoying these headphones. Great sound and affordable. Works great with my laptop.
4,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this! The cord was cut when I opened the package. This is what I get for trying to save money and buying used.
5,"In the past my kids have not liked headphones that go over the head because they are large and bulky. These headphones are bigger than I had expected them to be, but the are very lightweight and fit snugly to their heads. They adjust well for my 9 year old as well as my 15 year old. The sound quality is great and it is nice that you can adjust the volume on the cord. The cord is durable and very heavy duty. I am extremely pleased with these headphones. The only problem we seem to have is that we have one set of headphones and three kids."
6,Nice! Bought these for my daughter who is pretty rough on her headphones & has broken a few pairs already. These have held up well so far!
7,"Thanks to Ailihen for their support with their product. Complete honesty: First pair arrived and after 1 week of use went defective, Ailihen proactively contacted me for follow up and sent me another pair looking exactly as the previous one, but these worked perfectly. Great customer service. Keep it up."
8,"Okay first off, the quality of these headphones are absolutely incredible, and the mic is so great and easy to use! But I was highly dissatisfied mainly because of the fact that these headphones didn't even last me a whole month until the right ear started to cut in and out and now it doesn't even work!!! There's no damage to any part of these headphones. I was hoping that these would last me a lot longer but unfortunately they couldn't hold out. Wouldn't recommend"
9,"Very lightweight and build quality seems decent. It is definitely a good price for these headphones. Not the best audio experience, but good enough for dialogue based audio."
0,"I really liked these headphones when I first received them, but unfortunately they broke almost immediately. About a month after I began using them, there is only sound out of one side. I am disappointed in my purchase."
1,"Gorgeous Color, Perfect fit and Great quality. My 8 year old Daughter is using them at school and She loves them!
Quality and loud sound tooüòâ"
2,"I only give them 4 stars because they are a Christmas gift and haven't been opened yet. I can tell you packaging is great, color is exact to picture, and shipping was fast. The foam ear pieces look think and comfy for the ears. After they are opened and used ibeill update review"
3,These are amaaazing! Could do better with a bit more bass but definitely really well made. Good build quality and noise reduction
4,"The sound - when it works, is wonderful, as is the microphone. I got mine sent to me via Amazon as a gift for my birthday, and the right headphone doesn't always work. I thought it was my phone at first, until I could test the headphones on other devices recently which proved it IS the headphones. I don't know if it's worth it to get a new pair of these for the price if there is a risk of them coming broken."
5,7 year-old loves them. They work well. Great color. Mother approved.
6,"Lightweight, and ideal for traveling. I am on the road allot, these help maintain sanity by allowing yourself to relax with tunes or a movie. They are a comfortable design, so they wont kill your head when wearing them. The bold vibrant blue is gorgeous, so they are easily unisex. They woudl make a great gift for anyone. I use them with my tablet and phone to listen to videos and music. nice clear crisp sound they are a great headphone!"
7,"The headphones stopped working after three months of buying. And as of today April 25, 2017. have not been replaced, I have communicated on several occasions and have not solved my problem."
8,Looks great but only lasted a few days the jack that plugs into the head phones is of poor Poor quality as it bent after the fourth use now the headphones are not working
9,Loved these when I got them but after less than 2 months of using them the padding on one side detached from the headphone making them unwearable. No way to fix them. Amazon is giving me a refund after some discussion since it was filled by an outside vendor.
0,"I went through 2 pairs of these. Poor connection with the cord to the headphones, when that area bends the wires inside break. I lost sound in one or both ears. Don not buy these. Not worth the $20."
1,Always wanted headphones like these love them great quality and love the color the doing is great I also got this product for free or on a discount the wire is long enough and the bass is. Nice
2,The quality of this product is amazing. I felt like I was back at my clubs days in the 1990s. I am very happy with this product.
3,Bought these for my son and one side quit workin within 1 month. Garbage. Buy something else.
4,"I am very happy with these headphones. They are lightweight, and fold nicely to fit into a bag. I am no sound expert, but they sound good to me, balanced and even. They do get warm on the ears. This is good for me, as I bought them for flying, which is often cold. But maybe not for running in hot weather. The cable is fabric wrapped, and doesn't tangle. I love the color too. Overall, these are very nice headphones for the price point."
5,Cute and comfy. Works for both me and my 5 year old.
6,These lasted only 6 weeks before they shorted out.
7,I was hoping for some inexpensive folding headphones for travel but these are a bit larger than expected. Aside from that they seem like a good value.
8,"Very nice headphones for my grandson - and he LOVES the color!!! He uses these with his Nintendo DS, iPad, laptop PC, LG Android phone - basically all of his devices."
9,"The end connector broke completely off in less than 2 months of use by my 11 year old, rendering the headphones unusable. Very disappointing."
0,"Love the color, folds together nicely, quality product"
1,"Pretty good. Bought them for my daughter, they look good and sound good, can't beat the price."
2,"My husband bought these for me. They are Super cute, and they were pretty comfortable, but after about a month of regular use and now they don't work üò≠. It started with sound citing in and out of one side and now neither side works. I know things wear out, but that was kind of ridiculous."
3,Headphones came as described. They are adjustable and comfortable. Would buy from seller again.
4,"Love, love, love the headphones. My problem is that not even a month into own these headphone they broke, I can‚Äôt heard out of one ear unless I hold my iPod a certain way and jiggy the area where the headphone jack is. Very disappointed."
5,"I got these for Christmas, and started using them on December 26th, 2017. As of January 31st, 2018 they stopped working altogether. Nothing is wrong with the wiring outside the headphones, just zero sound now from the headphones when something is playing. I'm incredibly disappointed with this product."
6,I like the headphones enough but the cord last 6 weeks. Just outside of the return window.. Now they only play out of one ear.
7,Quality is not there even for the price. Jack cracked and works intimitantly at best.
8,So far I really enjoy these headphones. I haven't used the build in mic. The only reason I'm going to take one star is the plastic part were the volume control is seems a little on the cheaper end. But thus far have had no issues with it. I would repurchase these again! I also really like the color
9,Nice sound quality. I like this better than my ear buds as it helps cancel out the background noise. I work quite a bit from home and usually the tv is on which I find distracting and works perfectly to cancel that out. I really like the color. My 11 year old loves it too.
0,"Great headset! Comfortable to wear, easy to carry on the go! Works very well with my phone and laptop. Sound is well balanced, ear pieces give you good sound with loosing the surrounding sounds you may need to hear (like car horns, alarms, someone calling your name). I love them, far better than those tiny uncomfortable ear buds!! Well packaged, easy to open, delivery very fast. Received a follow up email from seller to be sure I was pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend this product and the seller!!"
1,These are very nice head phones for a nice price. Now they dont have to much bass but that doesn't mean they are not good. They have a great sound quality and would recommended them to anyone looking for a compact nice set of headphone for on the go.
2,I have to admit that I wasn't expecting them to work as good as they do at the price that I got them. They work great!
3,BOUGHT THEM FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER AND SHE WENT NUTS........JUST LOIVES THEM!!!!
4,"My daughter just received a pair of C8 headphones through Amazon for Christmas. They were comfortable and worked great for her until the left speaker quit working after less than a month of use. Based on our experience, these headphones do not seem very dependable. I would have given these four or five stars if they would have lasted more than a few weeks. Don't lose the warranty card!"
5,They worked great for the first month then the input jack tip broke off. I went to return them but I missed the return window by 3 days. I'm hoping the company will replace them or contact me.
6,"Great headphones, wore them to watch a movie on a tablet, great sound, and very comfortable. Wore with my phone to make a phone call and was very happy they could hear me very well!"
7,I bought this as a gift for my dad who is always on his IPOD. He loves the comfort and fit and inline controls. However he complains that the inline control is to high up and awkward to use. Overall a great set of headphones for casual daily use.
8,"Ailihen, thank you for making these great headphones. I can now stay in the living room with my husband at night while he is watching sports and I can play on face book. They work like a charm! The fit is very perfect, they are adjustable and, the sound is precise. I give them a very strong 5 stars and would recommend to anyone."
9,I bought these headphones for my girlfriend and they are amazing!! they fit perfectly over her ears and do a really good job of blocking out noise. she works out with them on and keeps telling me how happy she is they stay on her head at all times. and of course sound quality is amazing (i tested myself!). will definitely order from Ailihen again!
0,I've only had them for a few months and they have already stopped working.
1,"These headphones are extremely awesome they do exactly what were said, the color is also beautiful too. Thank you!"
2,Really loud she said happily. Only had couple weeks but so far so good with my 15yr old daughter.
3,awesome headphones constantly have people ask me where they are from. work great look great and amazing price
4,"My son initially loved these headphones but when they only worked for 10 days we had to ship them back,"
5,"Very nice! Had them for several weeks, sounds great, and no problems.

The headphones are not one seamless color like the product pic, but plenty of customer photos depict this. I like them, though."
6,"So far so good. Love the color and works great when doing online trainings for work. Haven't tried the microphone feature, as that wasn't a need for me with these. Price was good and so far, so are these."
7,"My Daughter loves it, and i love how the wire is protected and cannot break easily."
8,Great product for the price. These have been dropped by my daughter several times and never broken. Very durable.
9,"They're comfortable, cute and the sound is good but they only lasted for 3 weeks before the sound died in one ear. They brag about their lifetime warranty but I sure hope that you can jump through the multiple hoops they require for you to actually use the warranty."
0,I bought these for my 6 year old son. He loves them. Most of it is plastic but it doesn't feel flimsy. They are on ear but the faux leather is soft so they feel good. The best part is the chord is made of a nylon material not rubber which I love because it doesn't tangle and looks like it can take a beating from a 6 year old. I listened to the sound and its not great for an audiophile but it doesn't matter to a 6 year. They fold up nicely too.
1,The metal connector broke in half where it plugs into the devise the first time using the headphones.
2,Comfy fit at a decent price. I like that there is only one cord that doesn't tangle. Comes with a neat volume control that slides up and down. The button below can be used to answer calls or pause music. I am happy with this purchase.
3,"I received these headphones at discount through the Amazon review club for an honest opinion. These headphones are INCREDIBLE! Comparable to some priced much higher. Love the colors, and the sound is amazing. They fit the kids and adults both. I plug them in to TV, phone, and computer even when I don't need to for the sound experience. Its like having a portable movie theater. We are going to have to get at least one more!"
4,"I purchased a pair for my nephew. The first time he tried to use them, the jack broke off in the computer. Of course this was after the date to return them was closed. If I could, i would give them a zero star rating."
5,"After wearing these for a little while, they make your ears hurt"
6,"Ordered this as a gift for my little niece as a gift, and it stopped working after 3 weeks. Called Amazon, and they issued my a refund for this defective product. It looks good, but I don't think the quality is good."
7,"Hello, I'm starting up a YouTube channel that promotes products. I'd like to get a sample of these headphones to promote them. Thanks."
8,My son loves these! There is a button he can push that pauses the video he's watching ON THE HEADPHONES! Amazing!
9,Ok they sound great but they fell apart in a month.üò©
0,They were great headphones for about 2 weeks. My daughter went to remove them from her tablet and the end of it bent/broke.
1,One speaker blew out within a week. Very disappointed
2,My grandson loves them. He says they are comfortable and when he plays his games the sound is great!
3,I bought this item for my granddaughter and she is absolutely pleased with it. The quality is great! They are very soft against the ear. They work very well. The price is reasonable. I recommend these headphones to anyone.
4,Gift for relative.
5,"Really good headphones. The sound quality is excellent. These are terrific in-ear headphones that look and sound awesome. I really like the look of these, quality construction"
6,a little tinny sounding but good for the price
7,"Bought these as a Christmas gift, so they were used for 3 weeks, and then the audio went out on one side."
8,They are perfect for my 5 year old. She uses them for her tablet and in the car for her DVD player. She loves the pink color.
9,"Very happy. Thanks, Tom."
0,My son loves watching his iPad and I purchased many headphones that never sounded great for the same price or more.... I now want a pair of my own of these! Great deal! Great sound! Great price!
1,Very happy with how quickly they shipped and arrived. The quality is good and exactly as advertised. I do like the blue.
2,Its great and my daughter can't stop using them and did any one notice that the girl wearing the headphones from the sideshow looks fake
3,Listen to the sounds of wonder... Great headphones
4,Happy with the purchase. My daughter loves them.
5,Everything I expected it to be
6,Love these!!! Excellent for the price
7,"I really, really liked the way these looked, and the sound quality was pretty good too. Unfortunately they broke after about 6 weeks."
8,A++++++ item these head phones are very lord and fit very well
9,They looked and sounded great but bought as xmas gift its only january 15th and the 3.5mm jack just fell off end of cord maybe mine were defective comfort was a 10 sound was a 8 my quality was a 1
0,"The sound from these are amazing. I am very pleased. The only issue I can report is the padding on the ear muffs starts to become uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. Otherwise, great product and quick shipping."
1,"Ah, I can hear again! After my last pair of headphones ceased to work I ordered these up and the fit the bill. These headphones are primarly used by my son. The most important feature in this case was price as I am sure these will eventually be broken. What I liked about the ALIHEN C* headphones is that they are collapsible and have the volume control right on the wire. The sound quality is great and will serve our needs. The packaging was nice and easy to open."
2,I bought these for my grandson's 13th birthday. He absolutely loves them (he actually told me that). He is visiting for the weekend and has them on most of the time. Score one for grandma!
3,Great!
4,"I purchased these for my grandson, who is a gamer. He was very pleased with these headphones as the quality of his video chat was significantly better than the much more expensive headphones he had been using. The headphones appear durable and fold for easy storage."
5,"Nice headphones! I bought 2 pairs, one for each kid for using in the car with their tablets. They so far have worked great. I love that their adjustable so they fit me too if I want to use them. So far I have no complaints."
6,I bought them for my niece and she loves them.
7,"These are HEADPHONES. The manufacturer wanted you to be sure you knew, as the word is printed in large letters on the top of the headband as well as on each earpiece. Just in case you were confused... The padding on the headband and earpieces suggested a comfortable fit but they were very tight on me (I do have a large head, this is an issue I've had with some other headphones.) The cushions provide reasonable sound isolation.

The sound quality I found rather poor. Distortion was evident at even modest volumes and there was no bass to speak of. There is an inline microphone, but your voice will sound hollow and distant if you use it. Interestingly, the module with the microphone has a slide control for volume rather than up and down buttons. There is a single button that has multiple functions depending on how many times you press it - I don't like this as much as two-button models.

The manufacturer provided a free set for review."
8,"I haven't tried them myself yet, but they look like what they do in the description. I won't have a better review until after Christmas when my sister opens them."
9,Really good sound quality but mic quality is low. Not extremely poor but matched to the quality of the headphones the mic doesn't quite match the quality.
0,"It looks great and I really like the chord. Pros: color matched the picture, material was soft and comfortable. Arrived really quickly too. Only con is that the ear-phone size is a little smaller than I thought it would be. It kind of presses my glasses and ears a little too snugly so I cannot wear it for too long w/out breaks."
1,I bought these headphones because my old $200 dollar ones were breaking down. The sound quality was ok but I was used to headphones that sit around the ear and not on it so I found these uncomfortable but fine for $20 but then after just over two weeks the sound gave out in the right speaker. Needles to say I am returning them.
2,"I'm INCREDIBLY pleased with these. They are so much better than beats, as they are sewn together, rather than glued. The sound quality is excellent , and is also is great with smart phones to use to speak on the phone.

So wonderful for such a low price!"
3,Pretty sure I received a defective unit. Constant feedback in the form of humming and any time the wire is twisted it pops and crackles.
4,Excellent quality and powerful little headphones! The foldable part helped very much on a trip we took recently. Sound quality was great!
5,My son loved these headphones! Unfortunately they only lasted about two weeks before the cord on them broke.
6,Bought for Christmas. Shipping was as expected. I like how it folds and the wires are covered with material. They fit comfortably as well.
7,"The earbuds that come with my iPhone have better sound quality. Songs come through faded, tinny, and lacking any depth."
8,My daughter loves these headphones. She was complaining of pain from earbuds that she had and now no more pain and she loves the comfort of the soft foam. Very nice!
9,"I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Green is one of her favorite colors and she said it really blocks out the noise. She's happy, I'm happy!"
0,"My kids love them. I bought 2 pairs, 1 for ps4 and the other 1 for pc gaming.Great headphones."
1,I'm very pleased with the headphones. They are comfortable and work very nicely.
2,I am so happy with these headphones! I ordered them becuase earbuds hurt my ears and these are so much more comfortable. I love the color! My kids are already trying to confiscate them.
3,I use these every day for singing on a sing app on my cell phone and they work pretty well. Definitely not studio quality but they work awesome enough. Love how they fold for easy storage.
4,Nice set of cheaper headphones
5,Got these for my young daughter to use with her chromebook at school. She seems to like them okay. She has trouble with earbuds always falling out of her ears so she really needs over the ear headphones. Sound quality is good and they are adjustable.
6,"They sound wonderful, but the wire has a flimsy connection to the microphone and ripped quite easily. Just be careful to not catch the wire on anything."
7,I got them and I was so happy!!! I used them and the worked just fine. About a week later they started not working. Now the sound is very muffled and if you want a clear sound you have to turn them just right. Not very good quality. :(
8,So I bought these for my son to use on his kindle tablet. Day 2 and a piece of the part you insert into the headphone jack broke off and is stuck inside. Now we have a useless tablet because he can not use any sound to play his games. Not a happy camper!!!
9,"Comfortable. While they don't have the best sound or carry much bass, they're great for video game voice chat. These aren't Beats or the gaming version of Beats. They're simple and functional."
0,Perfect!
1,The quality seems pretty good and the sound is great just what I needed. They are also very comfortable on ears.
2,"Worked great at first, but now the sound is cutting out intermittently at the tiniest movement of the headphone jack, which makes the sound quality for my commute on public transit especially poor."
3,"[AESTHETICS & FIT] Rating (Out of five stars): ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
I ordered the color Color: Grey/Mint. The earpads have too much yellow in them so these look dirty. I would say the color is more accurately described as seaweed. One of the earpads, out of the box, has a split stitch. I suspect the rest of the stitching will be affected by this one broken stitch over time. The material around the outside of the earpads is painted to look metal but it's plastic. The headband is adjustable and comfortable to me. I don't feel too much pressure on my head or ears and I have a fairly big head.

[SOUND QUALITY] Rating (Out of five stars): ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
The instrumentals have good surround sound quality. The vocals are clear and only low-quality music has audio trailing or echoing in these headphones. (Self-produced YouTube artists have lower production quality and it's easily picked up in these headphones.) I was satisfied with the acoustics, vocals, and instrumentals.

[BASS] Rating (Out of five stars): ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
The bass is flat. It's not non-existent but it's not seismic. The lack of bass is distracting to me, personally, because I enjoy a rich seismic bass. My ears are looking for that quality, and it affects my ability to enjoy the music.

[NOISE CANCELLING & BLEEDING] Rating (Out of five stars): ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Noise cancelling in these is as good as can expected for the price. The louder you play the audio the better it conceals outside noises. The earpads don't appear to buffer out much themselves. There's no noise bleeding, though, which is important if you're listening to music around others.

[CONTROLS] Rating (Out of five stars): ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
These have inline control but there's little functionality. There's nothing to pause, play or skip music. There's a volume slider but it's really hard to control. As in, it adjusts the volume too much with little in between. I prefer to use my device's volume control. As is, I have no use for the controls. I typically don't like braided cords because they create transfer noise while I workout. This cord, however, is the exception to that. I can workout without hearing the movement of the cord through the headphones.

[SUMMARY] Overall Rating (Out of five stars): 18 out 25 Stars *3.6* Star Average ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
For the price, these are okay. If you're an audiophile or have discerning taste, I wouldn't recommend these. These are best for kids, tweens, teenagers, and any adult looking for a cheap solution. This won't break the bank if you lose or break them. They work well enough to do the job but don't offer a high-quality music experience.

4,So far they are working good. My daughter love them.
5,My daughter loves these.
6,"Can be folded, put on the luggage is very convenient"
7,"A good set of headphones for the kids. They really enjoyed it. The earpiece does get hot during long hours of usage but that is to be expected. It is lightweight enough for them to toss around and can fold easily into their backpack or storage bins. Sound quality is as good as headphones costing twice times as much, I would say on par with $40 sets of headphones. Construction seems to be above average, with a solid connection from the headphone cable. The pause and volume buttons on the cable work quite well for Ipads which the kids love and they can pause their youtube with it."
8,"The item arrived in perfect condition, a color that's cute and at a great price. This is a Christmas gift so I won't know how well it functions until end of year."
9,"The work nicely and I love the color. The silver part is made of some sort of cheap plastic material though, so they do look a bit cheap. But if you just need comfortable headphones in a nice color these are great."
0,"My grandson wanted these for his birthday. He just loves them, and has thanked me for them many times."
1,Worked great for a month. Not working so well now.
2,"These headphones have great style, the recipient loved it, but noted that the headband in a bit inflexible and makes wearing this item for a long time difficult."
3,So far so good. I love that I can control that volume on the wire instead of having to reach in my pocket to get my ipod out. Will buy more for my kids.
4,These were a gift for my 12 year old sister. She loves them! They seem to be good quality for the price.
5,Love them they work great and down out my boyfriend's rage gaming. They are super comfy and fit in my purse perfectly.
6,I was very unhappy with them. The wires broke with one week. The wire broke by the ear and then microphone quit wotking. I have a 2nd pair that the same thing is happening
7,Good product.
8,The headset was purchased for a preteen. It was a perfect fit of cost and quality.
9,"I am a teacher of a large classroom of third graders in an inner city school. I created a project on Donorschoose to receive funding for a set of headphones for the technology that I have gotten for my classroom. Although they are very pretty and my students were so happy t receive them, they began breaking within the first two months of use. At this point, we have had 6 pairs of headphones that no longer work due to the same problem (no sound will play). This was a great price and look great but their durability is horrible. I could see that maybe one or two would break, but they are all broken in the same way. Very disapointing and will not order them again."
0,Love the color. Sound quality is adequate for this price. Highly recommended for young ones. Would make a great Christmas gift.
1,"Pretty, easy to use. I like the pause button and volume on the cord."
2,"They worked fine for about a week, then they just stopped working. I can‚Äôt hear anything anymore"
3,This a great product. Bought it for my 7y.o. and she loves it...
4,Work great.
5,"You get what you pay for..volume control don't work, it is ether off or on very loud, no control over headphone. would send back b ut not worth the trouble."
6,"Cheap Headphones, They stop working after 4 weeks of use. Sound quality not that great. Don't Buy!"
7,"Works well for the kids in the car, they listen to theirs and i now have quiet. Is nice"
8,They work great. They are light on my head.
9,I got these headphones for my son for when he is playing his xbox so the rest of the world doesnt have to listen. He said they work great for him :)
0,Arrived quickly and looks like we had hoped!
1,They look great and are packaged well. I don't know how they work as they are a gift.
2,"Very good! Perfect service, one of my headphones don't work well, they shipped me a new one quickly. My son likes it very much."

9,Item as promised. Would buy from again. Thx!
0,Great to the price. Love the color!
1,My daughter adores these. They work well and are the right color.
2,These headphones are the perfect size and adjustable. It was an added bonus to have the volume control on the cord for this price. They fit well around the ears without putting too much pressure on them. I'm glad I took the chance and bought them. I plan on getting more for my kids when they have a discount again.
3,i like it
4,My niece loved this
5,Very comfortable my wife likes alot
6,They were perfect. My daughter loves them.
7,"Very lovely headphone, would recommend it"

3,Good headphone for price paid
4,Works great so far.
5,Good sound and very comfortable
6,"cool poo lol but it is cool
k done"
7,"These headphones look nice, work great and have a decent fit but the ""hinges"" where you can fold them up looks poorly designed. These would be ok for an adult if they were a careful person bit definitely not for children."
8,They're super cute and work great!
9,You can not hear very loud then the wire broke..
0,Great üëçüèª
1,Gift for my granddaughter--thrilled her!
2,Not at all comfortable and terrible sound quality.

4,"Excellent, very comfortable."
5,Great

9,Such an amazing product! Works so well. Best headphones i have owned
0,
1,Great!
2,Great thanks you guys are best
3,good
4,Its beautiful...awesome i love it!!!
5,I did give this as a gift to someone else they love the style and sound.
6,This is such a nice product to have as I travel alot and is comfortable and private for the plane. Light weight and great sound.
7,one side stopped working within 1 month
8,Well it just so happens that I don‚Äôt have one problem with this.
9,Awesome
0,These have a great sound and great style. My only complaint is that they can press my earring into my ears.
1,Broke in first montj of use
2,My Students love the style and functionality.
3,Just as described nice compact design.
4,the wire inside got damaged with use of a few week even though the outside remain good as new.
5,"The headband on the product is too tight and uncomfortable. It hurts the top of my head despite adjustments. I would suggest using more padding. I cant even get my resilient kids to wear it at all. Also, it would be nice if there was noise cancellation feature."
6,"Had to give 'em away as a gift. Not adjustable and too big for my head.
Sure liked the looks of them and wish that it said it was one size only."
7,"Didn't even last a month and half. So disappointed to buy a product and not be able to return it.
BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
8,Judi
9,Work just fine for my grandkids.
0,"Very pleased with the quality. Also purchased the Ailihen Bluetooth, so glad to finally find a good product, thank you!"
1,"Got these headphones for my girlfriend, Misunderstood that she wanted noise cancelling and that she wasn't going to even listen to music... BUT, these are nice headphones for the price. They have their own volume slider, and can get pretty loud. They may not have noise cancelling, but when you have the music on, I seriously couldn't hear anyone talking around me, so to me that was good enough. They fold nicely, and have a satisfying click when they fold up, but aren't crazy hard to close either. All in all they are great headphones."
2,Very comfortable and great for being portable and noise blocking. Only thing is the volume switch is a slide and if it's in the all the way up position when you plug them in you can't put your volume up any further would prefer buttons.
3,"This pair of headsets is an absolute steal for the price. For my purpose (using them at home to watch TV without disturbing others), these work wonderfully. They are good quality and comfortable.!"
4,"Sound quality is good bit great, and they are comfortable and fold down nicely. Great quality considering the price."
5,My 9 year old loves it. He listens to audio books on his iPad and pause button works out perfectly for him.
6,Great packaging and headphones - got them on sale and feel like I got a steal! Love the real color of them as well.
7,"I bought these recently and for the most part, like them. I wanted something that I can plug into my phone or computer so that I can listen to music or an audio book without disturbing others. I find the ear parts to be a little too tight sometimes. I am happy though due to the price and they are nicely constructed. The volume control is quite handy."
8,Bought these for a child and they work okay. The ear pad covers fall off constantly which is annoying.
9,"I bought this for my 5 y.o. girl to use in school. I purchased it because of the fun colors offered, the affordability and it was being sold by a reputable source. It is adjustable, the cord is an appropriate length, and it worked for her. It stopped working within four months. So the durability is within average but product longevity was below average."
0,"These are junk. My daughter can hear music, but not the words when she listens to songs. She has to hold the wire a particular way to try to hear the words. I would return them if she hadn't thrown the packaging away as soon as she got them."
1,"Cute headphones but I wouldn't call them quality. Good bang for the buck though! I absolutely love the braided cord and the way they fold together. The volume toggle is very touchy and the microphone is sub par, but I didn't order them for the microphone."
2,"The sound is a little bit tinny, but they are sturdy and they work just fine for my son."
3,These work great! They are cute and functional...what more could you want?
4,They've stopped working after 2 months. Very disappointed.
5,"The sound is so great, plus even without music playing you can't hear people talking to you."
6,My son absolutely loves these. I am very happy with the quality. Wish I could have purchased more than 1 pair!!
7,Broke within hours of opening the package. Have had no luck reaching customer service for returns. I really am disappointed. Something like this should last longer than one day!
8,"Purchased this for our 4 year old granddaughter. Works, fits, and sounds just fine :)"
9,"Cheap, great sounding pair of headphones"
0,These headphones were the perfect thing for my husband. He loves them and they work great.
1,"So far, so good. My son loves them!"
2,Great sound for the price.
3,"These headphones were delivered on time, they work great, and fit well. I like that they're foldable too so they take up less space when not in use."
4,They work great. I'm really happy with my purchase.
5,Great for the price!
6,I bought this headphomes as a gift and she love them.
7,Fantastic headphones. Arrived timely.
8,"I would like to buy it, it looks nice and good quality, if you were to buy'll do an update of my review."
9,Sound is great and volume control is handy. It's a little tight on the ears after awhile of wearing them.
0,"For the price, they are amazing. I got them on sale. They are comfortable."
1,Great for the price! Love the color and fabric cord.
0,got it for a 12yr old boy bday gift and he has it on all the time and said its soo much better quality and can't hear outside noise! lol
1,"These completely broke within the first six months (first the right ear was out for a while, and I just lost the left yesterday). Not durable. I would reference my warranty but I'm out of the states and I'm not sure that would work anyway. :/"
2,My son had these for about a week. The jack broke off. I do not recommend
3,The teal/mint gray color scheme is pretty. Sound quality is ok. Be warned that there is sound leakage and the people around you will most likely hear whatever you're playing. It's comfortable sitting over the ears and it's a good headset for the price. I plan to travel with it.
4,These headphones are perfect. They drown out all noise from my coworkers and have easy controls. The soft cord around wire makes it harder for any breaking/obstruction to occur.
5,"My headphones don't work after one month, I am very unhappy, the first month the headphones worked great from there the whole thing has been a bust"
6,"Looks great. Color and all. Feels very comfortable. The sound was okay. I had it hooked to my equipment. That may have been the difference. Maybe they will sound better in my phone. I plugged the jack into a headphone (jack) adapter to go into my Mixer. I had to fight to get it in.
But for the money, it's worth it. Again, feels comfortable and the color is beautiful. It's worth the money."
7,"decent sound for being a cheaper headphones. works with xbox one, fits over my 9 year olds ears just fine"
8,"My daughter got a pair of these for Christmas. The cord broke off and got stuck inside the tablet by mid-January. We sent them back to the company, and seeing it wasn't our fault, they sent her a new pair. Those broke within a month and a half that she got them. This time, the sound just slowly cut off. The headphones work great for the first 2 months you have them"
9,"Good looking and the sound from them is very good for the price. However they are extremely uncomfortable as the back of the earpiece presses harder against your ear then the front. If you happen to wear glasses as I do, it‚Äôs even worse, couldn‚Äôt wear these for longer than ten minutes before having to take them off."
0,I use these all the time and wore them on a plane for almost 12 hours straight and other than my ears getting hot they worked great. My only complaint being that the cups are just ever so slightly too small for my ears so it can be hard to keep my ears from getting cramps. Other than that they work great and I love the sound quality.
1,They work. The sound quality isn't as good as my apple earbuds. The volume control is really small so it's easy to accidentally blow your ears out. The ear cups do little to block out outside noise.
2,These are great headphones. The adjustable volume control on the plug wire is a great feature. They are comfortable to wear and fold when not in use. Great product.
3,"These are great headphones, the sound quality is fabulous. The volume and controls work great. I absolutely love the mint green color. These are my favorite pair of headphones to watch movies on my iPad"
4,"Very nice,clear sound with these! :) I actually had to turn my PC down as the old ones were crummy."
5,Bought them in February for my son he loves the color and for me and mom they work great when in restaurants and my son is playing with our Tablet . We have had them for about six months and they just started not working I'm about to contact AiliHen to see if they will stand by there warranty. I think they will we do like them!!
6,I was excited to receive these for my son. The sound quality and look were great. They were also comfortable for him to wear. My frustration is that they started to fall about with only a month of use. When I looked into possibly exchanging them I was given the prompt that I missed the window for a return. I don't want a return. I want a product that will last more than a month.
7,I needed some cheap new headphones to listen to online course study and to play games in my spare time. Working out great for the price.
8,"Well, I‚Äôm not sure what I expected for $20 but I got what I paid for. Cheap plastic housings create a tinny, hollow backdrop for a completely 2-dimensional sonic disappointment. If you think these are going to be acceptable for anything but video games or podcasts, think again."
9,These headphones are awesome. I listen to them in the office and they are loud only to me. I love them so much I bought 3 others for my children.
0,"These broke within the first two weeks of using them. It started with one of the ear pieces not working, then with a little manipulating with the cord, it would work. then the wire just came out of the ear piece. No way to fix. Not happy with this at all."
1,"Cute headphones but I wouldn't call them quality. Good bang for the buck though! I absolutely love the braided cord and the way they fold together. The volume toggle is very touchy and the microphone is sub par, but I didn't order them for the microphone."
2,"excellent product for the money love the color , I use these for my job taking calls. crystal clear no static. love these ."
3,Was a GREAT success with my 14 year old grandson! He was thrilled! Would buy again!
4,Item was purchased for my son..Was really surprised and the sound quality if the headphones.
5,"Good quality headphones: nice sound, good material, the cord is really sturdy. They hurt my ears a little bit when I wear them for a while, but most headphones do (i have weird ears?) so I wouldn't hold that against them. I really like the color and style so it's worth it."
6,Good fit with adjustable sizing. Cute for the granddaughter. Good sound for use with her tablet.
7,"Received these March 26, 2017. Worked real well for the few months actually used. Seemed sturdy. The fit was pretty good. Sound was good. Actually started using in July. Only used these with my cell phone at night before sleep. Unfortunately they broke completely last night. First the right ear lost sound a few days ago then last night Sept 4, the other ear quit. Would have given 5 star rating if they hadn't died."
8,"I probably should have done more research, but I purchased these to wear outside while running. The wind noise is unbearable! But wearing them on the treadmill is fine. The color is really pretty though!"
9,"Good headphone, very soft and feel very comfortable. My son loved them. And they are light weight"
0,"I love these. Nice and lightweight and work great. I use them for a keyboard, so wasn't interested in wifi and just wanted some well-fitting headphones. My head is small and most are too big and too heavy. These are light and fit great and are comfortable and the colors are a bonus. I did have to buy an adapter for the larger keyboard connection, but that was expected."
1,"I've been using these for a few weeks now and I love them. They are by no means high quality in terms of sound, the headphones themselves or the microphone, but for the price they are exactly what I was expecting and work well for me. I just wanted a pair of decent headphones that would have similar quality as my $10 earbuds but not hurt my ears (or my wallet) and these deliver. Plus I really like the way they look.

It seems that after some use, the mechanism that snaps the band into place when unfolding is not as strong as it was when I first got them. Sometimes if I'm just holding them and move a certain way, they will start to fold again. Could just be some rough housing on my part. Either way, folding and unfolding still works just fine.

I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking for a cheap but usable set of headphones. Obviously, if high quality sound is what you're looking for, you shouldn't even be reading this page. If all you're looking for is something that doesn't sound completely garbage and is affordable, then these are probably the headphones for you."
2,"These headphones accomplished just what I needed. They fit well, can be adjusted, block out unwanted noise, provide reasonable sound quality, fold up for easy storage and the cord is not crap.
I am happy with this purchase after using it for a few months every night when I go to sleep and very often in the afternoon to just relax and listen. I've used it in my CD player, my computer and my Android phone."
3,"The product was just like it was advertised and exactly as in the pictures! I LOVE the color and the design above most of the other headphones!

The only problem is the size of the ear cushions. They cover all of your ear but they do a little pressure over them since they rest on top of the ear ...so every couple of hours I have to take them off for a while to give my ears a rest because they hurt a bit. :(

They are NOT noise cancelling headphones, but they help to muffle outside noise. I bought them to help me cope with a construction that has been going on outside my house and when I put music in decent levels (I don't like high volumes), it covers up most of the noises! I still hear very sharp/loud noises but they are very hard to muffle.

The sound quality is clear and good! I really like them! I've had no problem with sound quality. The volume control works perfectly well and is a bit sensitive which gives you a good range of volumes. I haven't tried the microphone yet, but I'll write an update as soon as I try it.

I would definitely recommend them for a good on-budget buy! Very good value for $20. It kind of exceeded expectations, except for the ear cushions which are a bit uncomfortable."
4,Best Headphones for price & comfort. Nice and snug cover over my ears with a durable feel cord that does not tangle. Have not utilized the mic as yet - but figure that is always a possibility during my next game day. Might just have to buy another color of these to bring to work for a better listen than I have now with my other brand.
5,"Bought them as part of an Easter basket. They use them with their iPod, singing songs from YouTube, and while playing games on the computer. The volume control is great the microphone are a smart addition. the colours choices are awesome. I do not know who loves them more me or them. My only concern is the longevity of the sound within the headphones but fingers crossed this will work out. So far no issues!! The customer service was very personable as the company followed up after I purchased them to make sure everything was working. I would definitely buy from this company again"
6,"Bought these to use for Webinars, speaker works great. Nice quality, cute color, fit well. The bonus is that I love using them to listen to music on my iPad and the sound quality is excellent with a nice bass to high range"
7,"I really like the AILIHEN C8 Headphones. They are very lightweight so that after wearing for a while, I don't feel like I've been wearing them at all. I purchased the grey/mint color and the silver on the ear muffs make them look more than they actually are. I am using these with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Toshiba Chromebook and they work great with both. The cord is similar to a braided cord for a phone charger. Description states AILIHEN products come with 1 year warranty and are 100% money back guarantee. This would make a great gift!"
8,"I wasn't expecting much when I replaced my Bose bluetooth headphones with these, but for what you pay they are pretty decent quality. Nothing special, but definitely listenable. Haven't made a call with them yet so I can't speak to the mic quality, but I'm sure it's fine. If you are looking for a budget set of headphones, look no further."
9,"overall these are a great value.. I bought them to leave at my desk at work as opposed to leaving beats on my desk overnight. I mentioned the beats a point of comparison. These are light weight and feel good on the head, but they just don't feel as solid. The main reason for the point drop is because of the mic quality. I do use them frequently for webex meetings and I am often told to speak up. That said, for this price point I would recommend them to a friend or some random person taking the time to read this."
0,Pretty cool color and it stands out. Great quality and used it on an international flight. Great price too!
1,My daughter raves about these headphones... she says the sound quality is amazing and she loves the color
2,"I did buy it for my wife and she is very happy with it.
it's a great head phone and I'll buy again."
3,"It's too big for my head and it hurts my ears which have a lot of earrings. Normally headphones like this don't bother me because the hole for the ear where the speaker is is normally big enough, but the speaker area is a bit small in that regard and pushes against my earrings. I wouldn't suggest if you have earrings, especially cartilage ones."
4,"Just what I was looking for
Fits comfortably. Sound is clear; no outside interference"
5,"Purchased to test for my supervisor to listen to employees call recordings. So far so good, I have received all good feedback. Supervisors can hear clearly and the large ear muffs drown out the background noise. They are easily adjustable to fit different head sizes."
6,Great quality for price. 14 yr old son loves these. He says the sound quality is excellant and loves that he can also use them to talk to his friends over his XBoX. Only thing that would make it better would be a zipping travel case.
7,They look like nice headphones but my son had these less than a month and they've stopped working.
8,No stars. Got them at Christmas and no longer working by Valentines Day. Would not buy again. Disappointed in them.
9,These headphones fit nicely and are comfortable.The color is pretty. The mic seems to work well. The sound isn't as good quality I had hoped but they work decently and will continue to use them.
0,Headphones sound great. Bought them for my son for Christmas and he loves them. Unfortunately one side stopped working after 2 months. The wire for the left side broke near the jack.
1,"I like this product. It is not too bulky. One of the downside is though that if you have your music turned up loud, it's not noise canceling."
2,"Amazon: Once again Great Deal, Great Quality and a decent price. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend for a pre teen child for Ipod, phone, or tablet use.

R, Navarro"
3,"If you are a glasses wearing person like myself, the pressure from the headphones starts to feel uncomfortable after some time. Mostly used for work so perfect sound quality isn't needed, these get the job done for the price. Would recommend for recreational use."
4,We got these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They fit great and sound great!
5,"Just what I expected---and that's a good thing! Very light, good sound, can answer my phone while listening to a book. I walk two miles everyday, no problem hearing traffic."
6,these are for my daughter and she is 9. they fit her perfect and she loves the color.
7,"Bought these to use at work. These were inexpensive and was not expecting anything great. When I opened them, i immediately loved the color. They are more of teal shade than mint. The sound quality is excellent. Once these go on, I hear nothing but my music. I drowns out all office noise & chatter and once a fire alarm. Very happy with my purchase."
8,We are still looking for good quality headphones at a reasonable price. We tried Ailihen C8 but they lasted two weeks of daily use. Now the headset produces no sound unless the jack is wiggled.
9,"Love these headphones! I actually bought two pairs: One for myself, and then another pair for my boyfriend after I tried them out (that should tell ya somethin'). I was very surprised by the sound quality, it was honestly better than I expected (nice range, great bass). Of course, these can't compare to the $100 and up headphones you might buy elsewhere, but for the price, definitely worth it!!"
0,"My daughter is over the color pink and wanted some teal headphones and it looked like these would be perfect for her. And so we ordered them, they came on time and she loves them. She says the ear piece is comfortable. And they work well."
1,"Bought as a gift for my grandson. He is happy with them and has made no complaints, so good deal!"
2,"These headphones had great sound quality but they started hurting your ears after about 20 mins. Also, something broke in the cord and that made it so only one ear speaker could play. Okay for the price but you might want to spend more money on something that will last longer."
3,"Very good sound quality, especially for the price. I love that they fold up and can travel in my bag. They are comfortable, and the rubber inside the head strap thing keeps them from slipping off my head, but after using for a couple of hours, they make the tops of my ears hurt. Maybe I'm using them for too long at once, or maybe I just have big ears. Either way: very good!"
4,They fit great! Music sounds great in them. I love that they fold up for easy way to transport them or even just to put them away.
5,These were a gift for my grandson. He no sooner plugged the ear piece into his ipod and the end came off in the ipod. We don't know how to get it out of the ipod. If I send them back can I get them replaced? Other than that they seemed very nice. My grandson liked them but they broke right away.
6,"The package came very dirty, the box was semi flatten... and the tapes to seal box was not shut tight, looked like it was a return product. The padding's color was not bright, looked used. I am upset about it, but my daughter needed it right away to do her computer tests in school so I couldn't return it. Wish they would do a quality check before they shipped to customers."
7,"They worked good for about a month. Now, they've started making a buzzing sound and the volume is very low no matter how much it's turned up. It also restarts my daughter's phone when you plug it into the phone jack. I am unable to return it now. My daughter spent her Christmas money on it, so she's pretty disappointed."
8,"They are comfortable, sound quality is decent. And the microphone works great with phone calls, love the color and style of them."
9,I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.I STRONGLY RECCOMEND THESE.
0,Love them light weight so not at all heavy on my head...volume is adjustable on the headphones. Very pretty color too.
1,"very light and comfortable. Can hardly tell they are on your ears.
Quick delivery and a good value."
2,Great quality. Got this for my nephew as a gift to go with his MP3 player.
3,Great headphones fro a great seller. I bought two pairs of these and my boys love them. Highly recommend for ages 8 and up. They were delivered quickly and came very well packaged.
4,"Great sound, but the ear parts are at an awkward angle so it hurts my ears after ~1 hour. Overall , I'm satisfied, just wish the ears were adjustable."
5,These headphones were great! Except for the fact they stopped working only after about a month. The part of the cord that plugs into your device must be positioned just perfectly or the music won't play through both speakers. Definitely no good at the gym. Disappointed because I really liked these!
6,"headphones started out well, but 3 months in and one side doesn't work anymore. cheap garbage. I would attempt to fix it but I don't see any way to disassemble them. Apparently you really do get what you pay for."
7,"They look great and sound OK when they work properly, but the build quality stinks. With less than a single day of use, the speaker in the ear cup that has the wire attached began to crackle with the slightest movement. I determined that the connection at the in-line volume control was the problem. These are getting returned."
8,"I order a pair of these last year for my son, and while I wish they had lasted longer the 12months I did not mind buying another pair. They are EXCELLENT!!"
9,I like the headphones nice clear sound and bass the cord is very durable and long and having volume control is a +
0,"Bought these last week after my trusty earphones bit the dust. Honestly, the only drawback is the fact that they fold; the headphones don't quite come down far enough to cover my ears all the way. Not even mad about it though; they work well for the price."
1,"Very good and lightweight. Sound quality is good. They do get pretty warm the longer you wear them, although fair warning this is the first non-earbuds I've worn for as long as I can remember, so take that with a grain of salt. Also, the cord is particularly long, maybe too long for most, but I'd take that over the other extreme for sure. I use them with an MP3 player, they work great. I would recommend them for sure."
2,"Horrible item, lots of static for no reason too small for my little ears. I thought after reading the reviews I would get a great deal NOT!

Don't waste your money folks,"
3,I've only had these a short time but so far they seem to be a fine product.
4,Sound is terrible. Earphones don't trap sound. Ear pieces don't even fit head or ears properly.
5,"Good for the price. Sound quality could be better but again, good for the $"
6,"Product arrived in time in fantastic shape. I like that the cord is protected by this braided fabric type stuff. Sound is great. My only problem so far is the size of the part that goes on your ears. They don't surround the ear, but put a tiny bit of pressure on the ear and after about an hour my ears hurt so I keep ear buds on me as well when I travel so I can switch them out when they start hurting."
7,"The headphones broke in the first week of use. The sound was not so great, but then only one side of the headphones worked. My son feels so disappointed. A bad product."
8,"At first the connection from the wired in volume control seemed loose, but after finding my preferred setting I haven‚Äôt really had an issue. They have great sound and are comfortable to wear on the ears and around the neck. I took them on 15 hours worth of flights! They made it, and fit inside my carry on. For the price, definitely worth the buy."
9,"very good, fits head nice and is comfortable and has good sound and great service."
0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and one side stopped working 6 months later. Extremely disappointed, she LOVED them when they worked."
1,Broken within 2 months - can't return. Don't waste your money buy a better pair
2,This headphone is perfect. No complaints. Fast shipment and I love the price. Thank you.
3,Second time I used them the ear cushion came off and now I am unable to use them. There is no way to get it back on.
4,"I bought these for my daughter for her piano class. She loved the way they looked and initially they worked well, but they quit working just outside of the return window."
5,"I never write reviews, but these headphones deserve it. My older daughter got a pair of Beats for Christmas and ever since, her younger sister has been begging for a pair. Not wanting to spend that kind of money on an 8 year old, I decided to give these a try. We couldn't be more impressed! They are the best pair for the money. I'm actually shocked they were so inexpensive because they rival a quality pair. You won't be disappointed"
6,The headset was just what I was looking for. Very compact when folded and the sound was great on the plane. Very good purchase.
7,Great! I love the way they fold. Have used for a few trips and have had no problems.
8,"Initially, the headphones worked wonderfully. On day 2, the sound coming through the HD microphone became very static, and we are unable to stop it. Disappointing."
9,my son loves these.. they suit his PC gaming needs just fine and he thinks they look cool too.
0,Sound quality is terrible.
1,"These were great at first. Gorgeous color. Comfy. Braided cord was great. All in all, I thought they were a solid purchase. Fast forward a month and a half and the headphones barely work. If I don't have the cord a certain way, the sound cuts out completely. Pointless to buy if they're only going to work for a month and then you have soundless headphones."
2,I am very happy with these headphones. Wonderful product. I got them for my daugther to keep her own in her classroom. She loves them and I will be getting more for the whole family.
3,"Only used them for a few days, but they feel great and work well. I have not used the mic but the audio is better then most. I think I got these for around $20. If you find headphones for less then that they are usually pretty poor quality. These are a good value at twice the price."
4,I purchased these for my daughter who needed headphones for school. The price for these were nice and I trusted the reviews when I got these. My daughter love the colors. We will see about the longevity of this item and will update my review and rstings as needed.
5,"These work as advertised. They are really light, foldable as mentioned, and have decent sound quality for the price. I use these at work to bang tunes to drown out the distractions and my son uses these to play on his Xbox."
6,"I love these headphones!!! I use them when I workout and run and they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. My workouts sometimes last a few hours and these are weightless, snug, and have perfect cushion and support. I would buy this product and recommend it over and over again!!"
7,First pair broke after my son wore them a couple of times. Ordered a second pair and they broke as well. I give up. This is a poor product.
8,Even though they were described for kids they are still pretty big. These. Were bought for grandchild for school.
9,"Very good headphones for the price. Package came in great condition. If i had to compare the sound, i would say they are basic just like the earphones that come with your iPhone. Great for listening to music and talking on the phone as well. Just make sure when you get them you put the volume all the way up on the actual headphones."
0,Finally headphones that don't squeeze my head like a Facehugger.
1,"I love the headphones! I use them for work and personal use. Love the color, color is exactly as described. Fit perfectly. I have tried several other headphones, but these are by far my favorite. I work as a medical transcriptionist, they block out background noise and have a great sound quality. Best price out there! Very, very satisfied!"
2,"These break almost immediately with minimal use. I contacted the seller after the first one started working and then not working depending on how I held the cord. They replaced it. The replacement pair is now breaking in the exact same way. I want a refund, honestly."
3,I purchased this as a Christmas present. It seemed to work well for a couple of weeks but then we had problems with the sound. Suddenly completely stopped working. We tried a couple of different devices but no luck. These will be returned.
4,Sound is great! Love that I can answer my phone with the headphones. Only downfall is I wish I could get them a little tighter. Maybe I have a small head because they fit hubby fine.
5,My daughter loved them. But the whole foamy part that rests on her ear came unglued in two days. Can if be re glued. Probably. My husband is checking. I was just disappointed that they didn't last more than a couple days.
6,"They are great headphones, but do get uncomfortable after a short amount of time. I like the color. The wire that runs from the headphones is a little annoying since it is a fabric cord wire, and it gets tangled easily."
7,"Had this product for about 20 days before they stopped working entirely. I don't feel like I was particularly hard on the headphones or the cord, but within two weeks the right side only worked if the cord was held in a specific place and just today both sides died on me. To contrast, I paid $20 for my last pair of headphones and they've lasted more than a year and still work. Very disappointed."
8,"Don't mind my brothers face‚Ä¶üòÇ, The color was exactly what I was expecting, it's a little brighter, but it looks great, but it completely stopped working after two months,and I didn‚Äôt even use it that much,so yeah..that sucks"
9,Good sound quality and comfortable to wear. I didn't know what expect. These are great for the money. The fit and finish feels cheap but i assure you these are great headphones. I have had good quality sound. I even dropped them a free times and the sound is all good.
0,"Bought for my 15 yr son to game with. He says the sound is ""perfection"". He'said happy and I don't have to hear all the gaming battles so I'm happy too!"
1,"Pros:
Good mic even when used outside in the wind.
Good sound for music for under U.S. $20.
Shoelace style wire which does not become tangled.

Cons:
Wire stopped working after 2 weeks so returned promptly.
Somewhat uncomfortable wearing over 4 hours per day."
2,This is an updated review. They DO NOT last long. I'm late in updating this but the headphones went out about 2 months ago and I did not get much use out of them. I took a chance but never again!
3,"Fits a little loosely for my head, so the ear pieces don't sit right on my ears, rather one has a small gap between the padding + ear. Minor annoyance, but they still stay on my head just fine. Volume controls are nice (sits on the cord about breast level) so placement good too."
4,Nice fit very decent sound for the cost. Will have to see how long it lasts. Good shipping/packaging. Positive so far.
5,"love love love these headphones, they are comfortable and fit well. They do their job well. The sound is good not great, wish I had more control over the settings. But they fit my ears so well. Makes up for other defiencies. Would buy again."
6,"Item purchased as a gift for my daughter. She seems very happy with them. Item broke in less than 2 weeks. Returned, have not found a suitable replacement."
7,"These are really great headphones. I bought the for my son when is second pair of really expensive headphones broke in the exact same spot each time. I refused to once again buy those overpriced headphones and thought I would try these. He loves them. Great sound, same features of more expensive headphones. Would recommend these."
8,"I bought two pairs for my daughters and they love them! Their older cousins were definitely eyeing them as well. They have great sound range, comfortable fit for tweens and above! Also, you can't beat the price. The quality of the product is solid."
9,Great headphones. Good quality sound. Microphone in cord.
0,"They are of good quality and no regrets on the purchase. However, one of the headphones has an issue with the input jack, it has to be twisted in a certain direction for both sides to work. If it wasn't for that I would give this a 5 *.

I would return it but we went overseas for a vacation and really wanted to use them during the flight..."
1,"Great value, they look and sound expensive without the high price tag!"
2,"I previously owned the Amazon Basic headphones so I'll compare it to that

Sound: Amazon
Sound isolation: AILIHEN
Design: AILIHEN
Comfort: Amazon (this is the biggest factor for me, AILIHEN would hurt my ears if worn for more than 30 mins at a time, this may not be a problem for people with smaller ears)
Portability: Equal"
3,"I love my headphones! I use them for my online classes, while my husband is watching TV and my four kids are running a muck.t hey sound great. My only issue (which is with all headphones and hats alike) is I have a smaller head then the average person. They are not as snug as I would like, but they are the most comfortable I have found yet."
4,THese headphones were exactly what I was looking for. THey are light weight and have great sound quality.
5,"They make sound. The volume slider works, but is interesting. The fold up design is a little strange. Its made of really hard plastic, and the ears aren't to comfortable. Works well for maybe 2 hours, cant wear them much longer than that."
6,"I would recommend having a pair of these head phones for anyone who wants quality of product and sound. The head phones can be adjusted accordingly, and has a fit snug that I don't have to worry about outside noises. The best part is not only the color design, but that it is also collapsible, making it easy to carry around ether on your neck or in your pocket."
7,"I purchased this two months ago, and used it lightly. However, the left side no longer plays any noise."
8,Bought them as a gift so I didn't use them but they came on time and were cute.
9,"I BROUGHT THEM FOR MY HUSBAND HE JUST LOVE,LOVE THEM THE SOUND IS GREAT."
0,"I was nervous to purchase these as some of the reviews said that the wiring was bad. I have to add the caveat that I only really used them for our trip for 2 weeks. But during that time, I had them folded up, wrapped the chords around them, unwrapped them, etc... lots of times. They worked well for what I needed! I don't like in ear buds and these were comfortable enough to sleep with while wearing. They don't quite cover my ear completely, but almost do!"
1,I bought these headphones for my son who is on the autism spectrum and has ADHD. He rides a monitored bus to school every day with other students with disabilities. He recently complained of the noise level on the bus. Changing him to a different bus is not an option and it was suggested for him to use headphones with his phone on the bus. These headphones have done the job we needed for them to do. They block out the sound of the other students and provide good quality sound for him. They are also sturdy enough for his use. I'm very happy with my purchase.
2,"I have started using them and they work great. They seem well-made and are comfortable. Purchase was rather recent, but I will update if they fall apart. Color and appearance match picture. I love that they are foldable. We use them in an office environment for training, so storing them easily is important for me."
3,"Pros: headphones are lightweight but feel solid. The black and orange color looks great. The photo you see is a great representation of the colors that you get. The sound quality is very clear and very bright. It's a rope type cord that feels good. length is good, quality feels good, nice gold connectors. volume control works well answering phone calls ending phone calls, Button works well. I have an LG L90 phone which is an old phone but I cannot go to the next track it will only let me pause not a big deal. The earpieces swivel up and down so that they sit flat around your ears very comfortable. The folding ear cups is a great space saving feature Works quite nice.
Cons: not enough bass or bottom end. When you have the headphones on there is not quite enough pressure to create a tighter seal around the ears to give a fuller bottom end to the sound. For me this was an easy fix.headphones collapse to fold all you need to do is shove a small wedge in the Gap to keep them from opening all the way you can still collapse um but the wedge prevents them from opening which creates a tight seal around the ear giving you a fuller sound and more Bass. I just cut a piece of velcro put it in the slot now there's plenty of pressure around my ears to keep them tight so I get that full sound and full Bass."
4,"Love these! The ear cushions are soft and they really dampen outside sounds. I think these headphones are great (and stylish!).
It also came in a great box (clear front, sealed, gift-worthy). I could easily slap a bow on the package it came in and gift it as-is, that's how nice it looks. :)"
5,Wonderful headphones. Fit around my ears so they don't feel smushed. The sound is clear and oftentimes I have wondered if i had them properly plugged in because it doesn't feel like you are listening through headphones. When being used they completely cancel out sound around you and give you a surround sound experience.
6,"Great quality feel and comfort of the headphones, they cover my ears quite comfortably and the sound quality is not a problem at all. The cord is not like those flimsy plastic wires that easily get tangled so I'm never dealing with knots, and the headphones adjust easily to fit over your head without you having to hold it to your ears or anything. It's solid quality, and a great price, and the picture and color match so it's not a case of getting something different to what you're looking at. Highly recommended if you want something other than cheap in-ear headphones that gather dust in your pocket."
7,"These headphones were great when I first got them, I was using them all the time and loving this! Then after about a month or so (so after the 30 days return policy...) one of the sides stopped working. Over the course of another month, the other side slowly stopped working as well and now if only works if I twist the plug in a certain way. All in all, these headphones fake you out into a sense of security for about a month, but as soon as there is no way to get your money back they start breaking. Will not buy again. I thought they might be too good to be true. Will stick with Sony headphones in the future because mine worked well for at least 3 years before one of the sides stopped working. I think they spent most of the budget on looks for these headphones and not much on actual sound quality to lure you in. Sony doesn't look as nice, but at least they work for more than a month."
8,"I bought the mint color and I must say that they are more of a teal in real life. That said, they are very nice to look at. I love that the cord on these headphones is braided so that it does not get tangled. These headphones are also very good at blocking outside noise and they have very good sound quality, especially for the price."
9,"I bought these headphones in the start of summer, and fell in love.
The Bass is phenomenal, just as good and better than my Sentey earbuds (which have been through the wash more than once)
They are also stylish, and go with many of my outfits as well as enhance my facial features (Have gotten many comments)
I highly recommend the C8 headphones to all my friends.

My only complaint is the length of the cord, me, being quite short and very active, not to mention forgetful stepped on it all the time.
to prevent this I had to wrap it around my body, which was less than comfortable.

Also, I did not get a warranty card or user manual. Today I stepped on the cord and the jack was bent at a nearly 90 degree angle, I was very upset to find no warranty card in my box as the description lists. I will buy another pair because I love them so much."
0,"Wow! Great sound quality, especially the bass. Volume was excellent also. A good buy!"
1,"My daughter was a bit disappointed that these would not work on her phone because of her waterproof case. But, she uses it with her Chrome book just find and they are comfortable for her."
2,Great item high volume quality almost like beats our son love them
3,I love this head phones. Nice padded ear covers and I love that the head band is adjustable. I would recommend it.
4,"Worked great for a couple months then one side quit working. Disappointed since my daughter loved them and found them ""super stylish."""
5,this was bought for my 11 year old grandson. he loved the color combo and loved everything about them until our puppy chewed the cord and now they won't work. We will get him another pair of these. Good product.
6,"Microphone was VERY soft, even when turned to full volume. Colors were very cute, but these didn't last through the school year, which was the goal. It's off to electronic recycling."
7,"I love these headphones! They are awesome for music and for phone calls. They are not completely noise cancelling, but I prefer that as it is safer to be able to hear surrounding sounds in the event of emergency."
8,Not enough volume.
9,"As someone who loves listening to music, but is not a confirmed audiophile...I find it difficult to quantify headphones correctly. I've owned SHURE phones in the past, and have had a couple of good off-the-shelf pair, but I've never been someone who NEEDS perfection.

So, that said...for the average person who doesn't want to spend a fortune on headphones, these are pretty awesome. They have really good range. You can hear the bass, but it isn't fuzzy and the upper range isn't tinny. They fold nicely, and the joints don't seem like they're weak spots in the design. I really like the cloth braided cord, and the inline mic and volume control is pretty cool too. They feel comfortable on my big head, but still adjust to fit my toddler nicely.

The one thing I don't like, and it's small...is when something is made of plastic but is painted to look like metal...like the rings around the speakers on this pair. Oh well.

I received this product at a discount for an unbiased and honest review. I *did* however buy a second pair for our family at regular price...so I do like them quite a bit."
0,I bought these for my grandson for Christmas. As far as I know they work great and he loves them
1,Great sound and comfortable. Would definitely purchase again.
2,"So far my son loves these for the PS4. I had gotten him a different brand that didn't last a month, so we are very happy so far with these."
3,"I've had it for about a month or two, I only use it at work at my desk, and it's already broken. The cord is short circuited and only one speaker consistently works now. I would've returned it, but my window closed to return it like 20 days ago. Also, the headphones are so tight that my ears were sore after using for half an hour or so."
4,Got these for my granddaughter and she lives them.
5,These are great headphones with great sound. A little big for my head but that's no problem since I just use them while sitting. The microphone is great & the controls are fantastic and easy to use. The Mike is close to your mouth so folks can hear you without having to hold it up to your mouth. I got the mint\grey & i love the color.
6,These look good and are comfortable but after only eight weeks of light use there‚Äôs no sound on one side. This seems to be a common defect based on the reviews.
7,not sound proof but descent headphone for the price if you like your base
8,I have purchased 3 of this companies and they only last about 10 days if that.
9,Not working :(
0,They looked good as they were purchased for a church give back for school children in need.
1,The foam ear parts do not stay on and I have to keep putting them back on every time my son takes the head phones on and off. The plug in bent on our first and only trip. This is not an item that was used for more than 4 hours and it didn't hold up. Unfortunately it's beyond my time to return them or I would have. He's 6 and responsible with electronics. The item simply just isn't well made.
2,Both pairs of headphones I purchased stopped working after 6 months.
3,Bought them for my daughter and she loves them. She says the sound is great and they are comfortable to wear. She has recommended them to her friends.
4,These are lightweight but the sound quality is aweful. I'm literally surprised at how bad even for the price.
5,"comfortable fit, love the color, and most importantly they sound really good."
6,Bought these for my grandson who is visiting for the summer and his olds broke. He loves them and uses them every day. I haven't heard him complain about the sound or the quality.
7,"The sound quality was alright, but it doesn't block out noise entirely. These also only lasted about 2 months before one side stopped working. Kind of a shame that I paid about $20 for 2 months when earphones for $6 lasted over half a year."
8,One side of the set went dead in 3 months! I have a 2md set & hope this lasts longer.
9,"Ii like them, but noticed that if I unplugged and re-plugged I may not hear anything without turning my phone off than back on."
0,They work great. My grandson loves them. I purchased 3 different pairs and colors so he always has a pair where ever needed.
1,Headphones arrived quickly and work great. Sound is good especially for the price. Happy with the purchase.
2,"Great headphones for my daughter. She loves them and the color is very bright and pretty. However, ear padding started to tear less than 24 hours of having them."
3,Son loves them. Nice color and comfortable on the ear.
4,"Purchased for my nephew, he absolutely loves them! Great sound clarity."
5,Everything you need without breaking the bank. Solid sound and a good looking product.
6,"I purchased two of these, this one broke within a month of purchase."
7,I love these headphones. They are comfortable and the sound quality is pretty great.
8,A gift for my Grandson!! He loves them!!!!
9,"Great set of headphones, noise cancelling, clear crisp sound."
0,"Not quite as good sound quality as the I35 headphones, but there's a volume slide thing and you can actually skip songs with the button, which is neat. Also blocks out more sound than the I35

I'm not sure if I would pay $20 for it again but it's pretty okay (and I don't want to go through with the hassle of a refund lol)"
1,Great - my son goes through these things like water.. I am hoping they last longer than a few months... so far so good>
2,Works really well. My daughter loves this item
3,"Good headphones. The volume is good, and the mic sounds clear and good. I just wish the volume control were buttons instead of a lever."
4,Sound is good. Hurt my ears a little after long period of time.
5,Did not have to wait long for it‚Äôs arrival. Really like the way the item folds up.
6,"These headphones are attractive, durable, and life savers when it comes to my boys playing on their Kindles and 3DS's. Definitely a great value!"
7,Its cute but after a time only 1 side worked
8,Bought these for my 9 year old and she loves them. They fit her head pretty well (collapsed to the smallest size) and are comfortable on her ears. The cord is pretty rugged and they fold up easily for storage. Very happy with the purchase.
9,While we loved them when we got them 5 days into use the headphone plug bend and almost snapped. So angry about it simply because stuff like that shouldn't happen and it hasn't happened with any other headphones set we ever owned. Lets hope they will still make it through our trip becaue I have no time getting new ones.
0,"The sound quality is really good and I received my order faster than I expected. I was hoping I could plug it into my landline phone but unfortunately, it doesn't fit. I'm going to try and find some kind of adapter."
1,"The headphones work great at canceling out noise and are comfortable to wear. The color (orange) was also appealing due to the fact that I am a student and it is easier to misplace things and with orange, they are easier to locate. The fact that they also fold helps keep my already overflowing backpack neat and organized."
2,"Considering the price, it exceeded expectations. Comfortable on the ear, great sound quality, and folds up nicely too. Very happy with it so far."
3,I have been looking for a pair of headphones with a good mic that I could use for calls on my Smartphone. It may be too soon to tell but so far all feedback on the other end has been very positive.
4,We have one pair of these and liked them so much that we ordered this pair!!!
5,"They are great looking, but these headphones lasted 2 1/2 months."
6,"These are very comfortable and they sound great. I really like that the cord is covered in a tough material so you don't have to worry about tears. They fit my head perfectly which is particularly nice as I've had problems with headphones being a little too tight (and my head is normal sized, presumably)."
7,Only lasted 2 weeks. Metal piece that plugs into tablet broke off in tablet. Headphones useless and tablet has no sound.
8,After I bought it i seen that it only works for smartphones so i was a bit concerned but i got it early and used it on my computer and it worked so i'm satisfied with it. I haven't gotten to use it too much since I just got them but so far pretty good.
9,Very comfortable and allows great sound while providing ample background reduction.
0,"We love these, my son uses them for the phone, and to listen to music and they're noise canceling on top of that! Great Find"
1,They worked great until my dog ate them lol
2,These headphones look good and my son seems to like it.
3,"Pretty, sound is perfect and adjustable, comfortable"
4,I bought these for my 5yr old daughter. They have good sound for her and the price. The color is very pretty. The folding is nice but it feels a little stiff like one of these times it could catch and break...this has not happened though and like I said they are perfect for the price and our application. I‚Äôd buy them again.
5,Very comfortable and lightweight.
6,"I received these yesterday. Ordered to listen to music and movies on my computer. I was pleasantly amazed at the sound quality, appearance, and construction of these headphones."
7,Kid uses them for gaming and skyping. She loves them. She wanted foldable headphones and says these are great!
8,"This product has been purchased for a 10 yr. old for Christmas. They look great, but, they are a gift (I have not tried them out for sound quality).
At this time I would say, yes, I would purchase this product again."
9,Great headphones and really cute
0,They sound good but they are big in size. And there is no way to make them smaller.
1,perfect. my kid loves them. the sound is perfect.
2,"these were a gift to someone else, but came great was a beautiful color, and from what i heard from the person they have great sound quality, and long cord."
3,Really loud and good bass. It's for my 8 year old so he has to keep the volume down but it does have a very easy volume knob that's really convenient.
4,OK fit but volume control is on or off. Not much control
5,The headphones feel quite heavy and my kids are unable to use them since they find it very uncomfortable. WIsh I had not bought 3 pairs without trying one but I read the reviews and took a chance. Not happy with the purchase unfortunately
6,Bought these for my 10 year old son and he is very happy with them...easy and comfortable to wear and he thinks the sound is great.
7,"Great headphones, works and looks great. Right as expected."
8,Bought for my fianc√©e and he loves them! He said sound is good and works when we travel. Love how they fold and easy to pack (also bought case for them).
9,"Although the headphones arrived quickly and nicely packaged after using them for three days I really can't use them. They keep sliding off my head, the button is terrible to use and the sound quality horrible. Completely tinny and no bass to speak of. All and all a waste of time and money."
0,"The sound quality is fine for my needs and the headphones are comfortable. The cord is sturdy and the length is enough to comfortably plug into a PC. However, as an adult female the headphones barely fit me on their smallest setting. I feel like there should be just one more size option"
1,"Super comfy, very durable. I like the volume control on the headphones. They pack easily into my backpack. I ordered one for myself months ago, and they are still great. I just ordered two more recently for my parents. They look good too, so far."
2,"Nice headphones, cool color and solid sound."
3,My mother needed these for her chemo treatment and they are exactly what she was looking for. Arrived earlier than expected and provide great sound and quality!
4,We got these for my 11 year old daughter. She loved them! The sound is really good and the best part is how long the cord is. You can adjust the sound on the cord. They also fold up which makes them easy to put away or take on a trip.
5,"Received Oct 19th and my
Daughter has only used a handful of times and they are already broken! The sound cuts in and off and we have to mess with the cord into the headset to get it to work. After if she moves her head it cuts back out! Not happy as she has had them a little over a month and we already have to buy a new pair!"
6,"I purchased this headphone set to replace the one I received with my Yamaha Electric piano - mine had worn out. This headset is terrific, rich sound, comfortable to wear! I am very pleased!!!"
7,"great sound, durable design."
8,We bought these for the start of the school year. My daughter is entering middle school and wanted something a little snazzier than the standard black headphones. The color on these is great and they feel quite substantial. I listened to them for a few minutes and the sound was more than adequate for the price we paid. Overall I am quite happy with the purchase.
9,"Worked great, except the cord eventually got loose or something? I have to buy new ones and it's only been 6 months."
0,Comfortable and works great
1,My son enjoy it he like it
2,Daughter loves them! Nice quality!
3,"I was satisfied with the bass sound but the mid wasn't quite strong enough for my liking, which is of course a personal preference. If you like an emphasis on bass and are not too picky about the rest of the dynamic range, these headphones would probably be fine for you. They folded into a compact size and were soft on the ear. Also, the noise cancelling feature works well, and I loved the aqua color, stylish look. Very satisfied with the company's customer service."
4,Update: Customer service contacted me immediately after I posted the review about an issue with the product and will send a replacement soon. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this. My daughter absolutely loves them!
5,Best $20 I ever spent. I wasn't looking for anything fancy or anything expensive--just something I could use to listen to music around the house (ear buds are too big for my ears and won't stay in) I use these all the time not only to listen to music on my iPhone but also to play games on my kindle. and the added bonus was the color matched my iphone case! :)
6,This was actually my second headphone purchase. The first 1 still works had no problems. I took this 1 out the box and it only worked twice. Because I have a child on the ASD Spectrum and she is constantly chewing things I always have a back up. She never even got close to it.
7,Really like these headphones. They are very comfortable and I especially like that I can adjust the volume with the headphones.
8,Pleased with these -comfort and quality
9,I haven't had them two months yet and they already stopped working
0,"I appreciate the sturdiness of these headphones. The cable seems to be covered in some material that makes it more durable and less susceptible to internal breakage. I always appreciate a volume control and look for hat feature. What I would change about them is the plastic leather like pads. They do help to muffle external noise but they hold in heat and sweat. Sweaty ears is not my favorite sensation. If the room isn't noisy, just position them slightly off the ear for air flow."
1,"These headphones are affordable with sound quality to match. I bought these for my little sister since she likes to listen to the same song over and over. Despite her leaving them on the floor, kicking them around, and just in general being a kid, they are still in good condition and work just fine. The cord not getting all tangled up and the folding for portability really add to the durability, I think, since my sister likes to bring them everywhere.

My only complaint is purely cosmetic. The colors could maybe have more variety, or just a different set entirely as none of them were particularly nice, at least to my sister and me.

Pros:
-Affordable
-Durable
-Good sound quality for price
-Cord rarely tangles
-Easily packed

Cons:
-Bad colors"
2,"These were a gift and the recipient loved them. After learning how good they were I ordered a pair for myself.
There was one downside. The original purchase included a coupon for a discount if I ordered more that I did not know about until after the second order had been placed.
Not the sellers fault but it would have been nice to know before hand .
Perhaps with the multiple emails from the third party seller wanting feedback for the product this could have been mentioned.
Que Sera Sera"
3,Best headphones for this price. Now I can listen to my music with disturbing (or being disturbed by) others when I'm working or on the lightrail. The microphone works much better than I had expected for something under $20. This is the second pair that I have purchased because my first pair broke (you could only hear music if you held the cord at a very specific angle) and I didn't know about the lifetime warranty. *facepalm* I'll definitely remember this time!
4,I am contemplating on purchasing a second pair just cause! I love these headphones. They work great and are a bit noise cancelling but not so much! very comfortable and usually I am the type to have to keep adjusting due to all of my ear piercings but never with these.
5,"Let it be known that I wasn't paid in anyway to write this review (I also wasn't sent the product for free to review it).

For the price, these are pretty great. They are comfortable to wear, have adjustable ear pieces (for bigger/smaller heads), the cord is amazing because of its shoelace-like durable nature, and the color (teal) is poppin'. I like the on-wire controls for volume as they come in handy when you need to turn them down as fast as possible. Oh, and the microphone works swimmingly.

The only thing I find lacking is a good bass sound... But really, for how cheap these were, I can deal. Everything else is pretty sweet.

P.S. As a full-time student who also works a few part-time jobs, it's awesome that these fold up well; I can put them in the top of my backpack and not worry that they'll break."
6,I have not been impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. There was a short in the 1st pair I bought so one side didn't work. It fell within the warranty period and so were replaced. The same thing happened to the 2nd pair--a short in one side so you cannot hear. Kinda important in a headphone to be able to hear. I have been impressed with the customer service. They noticed the 1st pair still was within the warranty period and sent a replacement.
7,"so far my 14 yr old hasnt broken them and it has been a 2 weeks! He even brings them to school, and if u knew him you'd understand my excitement!! good sound, fits well, and an added bonus for him is the outside noise blocking- not a bonus for mom ;-) thank you for a good product so far. ..here's to hoping they last longer and i can share the second set u bought as a backup, expecting they'd break."
8,"These are horrible. We ordered 2 pairs. The first one broke within 2 days after they fell from the table. The other ones power cord actually broke off inside our ipad after a month and we had to dig it out! I contacted customer service after the first one broke and they contacted me very quickly and said they would send out a replacement. I was very happy...yeah, they never sent it and it's been months. These headphones are pretty, but not durable at all!"
9,"Bought these headphones in May. Love the fit and the sound quality. 7 months later now, the sound is cutting out from the right side. Really sad as I use these all the time between my computer and tablet. Will probably buy another pair but might just dish out the money for a wireless set. Rather sad because I really did like these a lot.

Update: After speaking with their customer service (who was very helpful btw!) I will probably just end up ordering a new pair of these same ones as I really do like these headphones."
0,It broke leaving a piece inside the iPad.
1,"I teach English Language Learners. In the spring of each year, we give them a test to see how their language has improved. For a portion of the test, the students must complete a speaking section. These headphones with microphones were AWESOME! They worked out GREAT and picked up the students' voices very well. I will be purchasing more of these headphones with speakers!"
2,"Very good for its price. I was mostly looking for headphones that had volume control and this one does the job fine. You can slide the control up and down, and it operates separately from the volume bar on your phone. The sound quality is all right, I usually need to go to high volumes to hear my music clearly. The headphone wire is very long but it's a minor detail. Overall, it's a nice purchase."
3,They didn't hold up not pleased
4,I love them so great !!!! sound really nice will buy again for sure !!
5,"Very clear sound, very affordable and the color is great!!!"
6,"Very good for the price. I like the controls on the cord. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the round ear pieces. Hate to say it, but I have a big head. :-). And those ear pieces pinch after a while."
7,Great sound for the price! I wear these when I work out 5 days a week. They are easy to clean and fit snugly.
8,Good sound and microphone. Bought them to use in a busier office setting for phone meetings. The headphones block out much of the background noise and the microphone seemed to work well. I highly recommend.
9,"These headphones have been used lightly for 3 months, mainly when the kids are laying in bed watching a movie. The sound is good and they are comfortable. I give only 3 stars because they have stopped working after only 3 months. If you twist the cord just right the sound will work but that shouldn't have to be that way."
0,Perfect for me! Good quality for the price!
1,These are a Christmas present for my son. I cannot give you an honest opinion just yet. Hopefully they work good and last long.
2,Great headphones with nice features at a great price. What's not to love?
3,Cheap headphones that conked out on me w/in two monthsüòï Not worth the money.
4,"I purchased this pair knowing the Audio quality is poor, actually after hearing them, they are real bad, but I modified them using a pair of 40mm, 50 Ohm, Sennheiser HD-559 drivers. Perfect fit in less than fifteen minutes I replaced both drivers, including soldering the new drivers and locking them in place. Talk about the ""WOW"" factor, they sound incredible, at least 90% better than the original ones, you can't even tell they were modified, until you listen to them. No cutting, no hastle everything fit in place, if you have older beat up broken or ugly pair of higher end Headphones, then theses Headphones are perfect!!! I'm going to try and upload pictures."
5,My 9 year old daughter got these with a gift card and seems very pleased with her purchase.
6,great color and size
7,Suitable for a child
8,"Great looking and comfortable. Sound is not as rich as I would like, but good for work."
9,"My daughter loves her new headphones.
She's happy.üòÅ."
0,"Nice fit, good sound."
1,Gave these to my 6 year old nephew for Christmas. He has already managed to break the audio end off in his iPad. Honestly I don't know if it was him being to rough or of this product wasn't up to taking on a 6 year old boy. When he opened it it looked to me that this product would hold up under his wear and tear...
2,Use these at work all the time they are comfortable and don't make my ears sore.
3,"Very nice design. Love the volume control function as a slider. I am still searching for a compatible case for these headphones but I don't think they are as fragile as they look, which is a great thing."
4,These stopped working after two months of very light use. Next time I'll spend a few extra dollars for headphones I won't have to replace after just a few uses.
5,"I don't blame the seller, but the auxiliary prong snapped off after first use (no unusual bending, etc.). Sound quality was good for the 10 minutes they worked."
6,"The padded ear cover came off within 2 days of using it and it couldn't be put back on. I know they weren't very expensive but I expect more than 2 days, and if this part coming off is a problem then the part it goes on to should be removable so it can be put back on."
7,Seem to be working out really well so far. No complaints
8,"Product lasted 3 months of minimal use. Sound great and look great, just don‚Äôt last!"
9,"Bought these for running, they are ok - not good, nor bad. The music doesn't turn up really loud, but loud enough, and my ears sweat a lot when doing cardio. The fit is what you would expect, ears didn't hurt from having them on for more than an hour. I love the neon green, it's the same as it is in the picture."
0,"I am pretty OCD when it comes to overhead headphones, I have about 20 pairs, maybe more. The two biggest issues I find, not concerning the sound, are usually the cord, it's either too short or it just breaks over time causing buzz and other problems, and the size of the headphones themselves. Even ones you can extend tend to be too small for a guy with larger head, especially ones that come in all kinds of funky colors. That said, this product is very well priced and there are several other reasons why it deserves good rating:

PROS:
- price! These are cheaper than 90% of the other ones that I have, currently priced at 19.99
- modern, original design
- adjustable band, will fit a child as well as a grown up (however if you are a man and have a larger head, these may be slightly uncomfortable for you, with the band pushing on top of your head)
- good sound, its not perfect but keeping the price in mind, i believe its about a 4/5
- comfortable padding
- smaller earpads, this could be both a pro and a con, depending on what you prefer
- volume button on the cord
- built in mic on the cord
- you can fold them up for easier storage
- great noise isolation
- the cord is woven, not coated in rubber. those tend to last longer plus it also looks way better

CONS:
- personally i prefer larger earpads, this depends on personal preference
- the cord isnt detachable, could break over time and you cannot replace it
- even though you can extend the band, it may be too small for a person with larger head
- quite some noise bleed (other people will hear what youre listening to when youre using them)

MEASUREMENTS:
headband: 1.25"" wide on top
earpads/speakers: 3"" in diameter

Sound wise these are very good, the bass is about 4.5/5, pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to headphones in this price range, I was surprised at how balanced it sounded. The noise reduction is great, when you have them on, you dont hear sounds from your surroundings (which could be dangerous if you're walking or riding a bike in traffic, so be careful ;) such as tv, radio, people talking etc.

My favorite part is the design, the silver details on the side are very cool. overall I like them, you do get a Great value for your money plus the item comes well packaged in a box."
1,We love these! Sturdy and cool.
2,"Great for the price, they aren't really over ear and are a little uncomfortable. It's kinda in the middle of over ear and on ear and its awkward because of this. Look great and sound good for the PRICE. Volume/pause control is way to high up you cant see while adjusting if the headphones are on your head."
3,These headphones are huge. Even on a huge head they are uncomfortably big and keep sliding back and off my head and this is on the smallest setting. Sound quality is a little quiet. Microphone works great! They also aren't compact at all.
4,My son loves it! I so do I no noise!
5,These work great. I use them with my Kindle. Very happy! Thank you.
6,Arrived QUICKLY and on time! Excellent condition...excellent sound...love the color! Thank you!
7,"Purchased these a birthday gift for my son who just turned 12 and he absolutely LOVES them! ""Best headphones ever"" he said. Thank you AILIHEN for the quick turn around and great product!"
8,"I bought 3 of these in different colors for a Christmas gift for 3 of my kids. Unfortunately, as of right now all 3 are broken. 2 of them ended up breaking the tips off in their kindles, and now they can't plug any headphones into it. And the other one, the plug in tip is bent and will not work. I know kids can be rough, but really? All 3? Very disappointed in these."
9,My daughter is liking this.
0,Headphones worked for 3 months then started having static in the audio. poor quality
1,Nice for the price
2,"Perfect! These headphones fits on my ear very comfortably. Theses headphones are soft and nice to listen too. Don't let the price fool you, these headphones are so good. I already order one from this company, but I accidentally broke it, so I ordered another one. And I'm gonna keep ordering from these guys again, and again."
3,My daughter loves them! Made the perfect gift
4,I gave this as a gift to my 12 years old and she loves it as it is light and very comfortable. The size is comfortable for adults too. I must add that the company AILIHEN has provided great customer service when I needed it.
5,"Bought these for my husband, then bought me a blue set. I like these, but if I wear them for a long time (more than an hour) my ear starts to hurt on the outer part."
6,Folding headphones are so portable!!
7,Sounds great i have a big head fits snug but everything does;)
8,They look great but it is a gift so don't know how they work.
9,"good sound quality for the price. headset width is not adjustable, reduces overall comfort."
0,"These are the best headphones I have ever bought. I love the way they look, feel, and sound. I love the way you can turn down the headphones themselves without touching your device volume. If your buying depends on this review, then there is no doubt that you are buying this!"
1,I got these headphones for my son for school. He has several classes where he uses his iPad and the teacher requires the students to wear their headsets. Headset is light weight and comfortable. My son says he enjoys wearing them.
2,My son loves these. He takes them back and forth to Nana's house so we really like that they fold. The sound is great and these have a microphone.
3,Great headphones! I use them for my CD player!
4,I bought these headphones for work (just listening to music while I input data). They are comfortable and the sound is good. I've had them for a few weeks and I would definitely buy them again. The teal and gray colors are BEAUTIFUL.
5,My son really liked these for school
6,"Exactly what I had been searching for, for my 9 year old! She loves them. And doesn't complain that they hurt her ears!"
7,Pretty good headphones for the price.
8,"Sound is good, love the color. However, within 30 minutes my ears were hurting. These seem like theyd work better for a child."
9,The headphones are comfortable and reduce outside noise. Great sound.
0,I use these with my hearing aids listening to music on my IPhone SE.
1,We bought these for our 4 year old son to use with his tablet. He's had them since Christmas and they work great so far!
2,These headphones are great for the price. I was surprised at the clear sound. I am very pleased with them.
3,"Purchased for my 10 year old. At first glance, they look big, but they fit my 10 year old and myself perfectly. Excellent sound and easy to adjust volume control."
4,"The product came on time, which is much appreciated. Foldable headsets are the way to go. This is a great product."
5,Love these headphones! The sound quality is great and I really like the color. I've gotten many compliments on them.
6,Clear and great buy for the price
7,7 year old son seems to love them
8,"Ordered these for my son to use on his Ipad- They are very nice for the price! Sound quality is not on par with a higher end headphone, but Honestly fro the price you shouldn't expect Beats or Bose. They are comfortable and have no bleed out of sound, so I don't have to listen to his Minecraft videos :)"
9,I like it very much. I love the color and it works very well.
0,I was skeptical of these. Once received the quality was better than I expected and my son loves them !
1,The sound quality is great and the ability to block out other sounds is great. My child loves them and so do I.
2,NICE Soundüòä
3,Son loves them
4,"Bought as a gift for a friend, she loves them."
5,My 12 yo son loves these headphones with his tablet! They arrived promptly and packaged securely. A great buy for a great price :)
6,"These are great headphones. They do run a little big, but that is my only complaint. I love the cord, it is more of a fabric type so it doesn't tangle easily."
7,"For the price point, they're pretty good. I wish they could be adjusted to go smaller, but otherwise, sound quality isn't bad."
8,"I really like what I got! I bought this mainly for my granddaughter to use with our Roku 3, and I'm very happy with this product! Plus I love the mint-green color as well!"
9,"They work great for myself, but would not recommend for a man, because they just fit me perfect. They block out other noise great, I bought them for when I have migraine mainly,so I can have quiet with just soft music. Suited me needs great"
0,Love the color look and feel of these. Great buy
1,Didn't last long
2,Thank you
3,Visually agreable and with a very nice sound. I'm satisfied with the product.
4,It broke after one week and I returned it.
5,"very comfortable; sound quality is much better than old stereo phones (which were 6 years old).
I like the color package; I try to avoid getting everything the same color so this makes it easier to find."
6,These headphones were very bad the first ones that I got broke within 2 months and the I emailed the warranty and they sent me new ones and they lasted a couple of weeks I don't recommend getting them
7,Broke after 6 wks.
8,Great head phones
9,"The product arrived on time. I would have given this product 5 stars, but the headset is tight on the ears with no adjustment other than that it is a very good product."
0,"Great headphones! Bought them for the kiddos for Xmas and love that they come in different colors so that I don't have fights over which ones are whos... my daughter will even wear them and I didn't know if she would because she says she ""doesn't like things on her head"" (she's 11 yrs old)."
1,"They fit well, and with no noticeable distortion."
2,Bought these as an inexpensive replacement - so far - so good. No complaints. Good product and decent price.
3,My daughter does like her new headphones
4,There are extremely cute and comfortable. I wear them all the time.
5,"It's not 5 stars because if you have a big head, it's difficult to adjust it."
6,"My son said ""can you give them more than 5 stars"" so I'm guessing they are awesome! He also said other kids have broken theirs already and his are like new, so I would say great quality! Also he is a very picky 7yr d on how things fit/feel!"
7,I bought these as a gift for my daughter after reading the good reviews. They are cute and comfortable but sadly they only lasted a few days. The jack that plugs into the device was bent and I‚Äôm afraid that if they continue to be used it will eventually break off all together. Disappointed.
8,Bought as Christmas gift.
9,"I use these for running in the morning. The earbuds that I was using before keep falling out of my ears, these work wonderful and sound amazing."
0,"I absolutely loved these headphones at first. But after about two months of use, no sound at all comes out of the left ear.

I'm a little disappointed, because I really wanted to like these, and they seemed to get pretty good reviews. But now I see that all the bad reviews say the same thing about the sound not working. Such a bummer."
1,"So I've had these for a couple of weeks to make sure they are as good as they first appeared, and they are. As a college student in a triple dorm, I often find myself using them for extended periods of time to focus on my work. They're comfortable, relatively portable (obvioisly not as small as ear buds, but they still fit in my bag perfectly fine), have great sound quality, and block out a good amount of background noise. I would asolutely recommend these head phones to anyone looking for a great pair on the less expensive end of things, like a fellow college student."
2,"Initially bought a pair of these because they were affordable and I really liked the look and vibrant colors that were offered. Unfortunately, the pair I had seemed to have a loose wire connection and would cut in and out when the wire was moved. Wrote a quick email to the company and got a full replacement no charge. Extremely satisfied with the customer service. You're not going to get 10/10 sound quality like you would with some Beats or Bose headphones but for the price these are offered at they fit the bill and with a 12 month warranty its a good buy especially if you are very active and likely to damage your headphones."
3,Works perfectly on my new fire tablet. What a handy little button right on the cord within easy reach. I must have a small head though because the fit is a little loose. Wouldn't probably be a good purchase for a younger child.
4,The headphones were good and arrived as depicted in the photograph. They worked great and the sound was clear. The ability for it to work with the Galaxy S7 was a great feature. I ended up returning it b/c I felt they were defective and squeezed my head way too tight. I couldn't use them for more than 20-30 minutes without having to take a few minute break from wearing them.
5,"Seriously in love with these headphones. I purchased them to use on my prep time at school and they do the job. Great sound quality, beautiful color and pretty good noise cancelling quality though I wouldn‚Äôt use them solely for that purpose. I also purchased the amazon recommended case to bring travel with them. Both are great , quality items for an inexpensive price that I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy again."
6,"Great sound and super comfortable. My son picked these out because he loved the color, and I could not be happier. The adjustment range is awesome. the quality of the cable is amazing, it‚Äôs not flimsy at all. Will be ordering another set for my daughter."
7,"My son has been using these for about a month and we're both happy with them. The cord and connector seem sturdy and won't break quickly. We've had issues with this part in the past with other headphones. Let's face it, kids are hard on things."
8,"One ear went out within a weeks time. Instead of replacing, I returned them to Amazon, as the sound was not what I was looking for. Very dimmed down.
However, with a fully functioning set they could and would be good for monitored children's use, without breaking the bank. Beautiful green color and they conveniently fold up, smoothly. Came packed well enough is a box with a clear top. Just wish they would have lasted longer and had better sound for music. Regardless, great for children or travel, if functioning properly."
9,"This is the third set of these headphones that we have tried. All three have become defective in a short time. The supplier has been very proactive in trying to help get us replacement items, but once again, in less than 2 months, this pair's (which according to the supplier is their upgraded model) jack has broken off and gotten stuck in the electronic device. These headphones have not been handled roughly and have been inserted and removed correctly/gently after each use. Very disappointed."
0,"Purchased these for a teenager. He's had them for just a few weeks, but, I am told he loves them and is very pleased. He wears them everyday for several hours while doing homework."
1,Remarkably good for the price. No issues at all
2,My husband loves these! He likes to watch videos and play games he can't hear anything around him so he isn't disturbed.
3,Granddaughter loves it.
4,"Covers for ear cups, both, came loose in three days. They emailed instructions for repair. Sounds quality great otherwise"
5,"Unfortunately, I received a faulty pair which really bummed me out, but Ailihen was really cool about it and issued me a refund :) Before my pair broke, they were good headphones with good sound quality, I really liked them! They look exactly as the photo shows as well, and the cord is a pretty long one."
6,"Very good headphones, my daughter loves the color."
7,"Great product for the price. Pretty good sound, seem durable. I would recommend if you're looking for inexpensive headphones."
8,I bought these to replace a Bose I got as a gift. Every bit as good as Bose at 1/10 the price.
9,"They work fine but after an hour or so they hurt my ears. I looked at returning but I would have to pay $7 to return. Since they only cost $20 to purchase, they are fine but I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again."
0,Is been working but now is really not working for both sides
1,Great product great service
2,thank you.
3,"Great sound and it's so nice to be able to pause/play videos with the button on the wire, as well as volume control right there at your fingertips. Very comfortable to wear. Bought one for my hubby and myself, we both love them."
4,Great product voice comes in clear as a bell.
5,Christmas present for my nephew and he loves them. Orange is his favorite color and they are reasonably priced.
6,"Bought for my daughter who just started kindergarten, they fit her well. I tried them on first and gave them a test run, very good sound quality and construction. If I didn't already have high end headphones I'd buy some for myself"
7,"Purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He liked them just fine when he first received them, however unfortunately since then (less than two months later) he can only hear out of one side and the sound on the remaining side is going in and out."
8,"Bought these for my 9 1/2 yr old son who loves music and he absolutely loves these headphones. He ran to me saying ""mom you gotta check out this sound!"" He was right. The sound was awesome! Great quality, very durable and he loved the color blue (his favorite color). I would definitely recommend these to anyone."
9,"I purchased these headphones for my 9 yr old as a birthday present. He absolutely loves them especially the color, very unique. He had asked for Beats because a few friends had them, but after he saw these he was like I'll keep mine. He said the Beats his friends had were black didn't look as cool.

Also the sound is great for his phone and even when playing his PS3."
0,"They have a good design and seemed great at first but with standard use (and no visible signs of distress), one ear stopped producing sound within 6 weeks and the other a week later. Cannot recommend these."
1,Clear sound and soft ear pieces.
2,I got these for my five year old and he absolutely loves them.
3,Most excellent headphones for all listening experiences.
4,"Arrived on time, look nice, work well"
5,"i am very disappointed with the sound of these headphones, pretty comfortable to wear but the sound really lacks, i use them primarily on my iphone 6, i keep them only as a backup pair"
6,I use this all the time now for my online classes to listen to videos. They are very comfortable.
7,These headphone are soooo great! Very koud and clear!
8,I received this item today and the right headphone is rattling like something is loose inside. The volume in the right headphone is low as well even when I turn the volume all the way up.
9,My husband said they're cushioned enough for him to wear comfortably all day.
0,"This was for my son, but he seems to be very happy with the purchase. They're comfortable and the sound is clear."
1,Great headset and customer service . This headset has outstanding performance. Noise cancellation works super.
2,"They were great for four months, now they don‚Äôt work. To my knowledge I haven‚Äôt dropped them at all and have been pretty careful with them so it‚Äôs disappointing.

But, anyways they were comfortable and reliable during the past four months."
3,"They seem to have a high-end finish, which makes the connection and bend points redistent to my children's prying! Happy with the product."
4,"Work great, comfortable to wear, no complaints. Would recommend / buy again"
5,Great Set of ear phones!
6,Cable broke after light use after 2 months and outside of return window.
7,These are great for my daughter
8,These headphones sound great!
9,"These were great headphones... for exactly two months of light use, then the sound output became garbled and fuzzy. I'm tempted to buy them again because they did feel sturdy and good quality, but I feel badly that these are going in the landfill."
0,Good value.
1,"These headphones for my grandson were perfect. They are easy to use, feel solidly built and were true to the bold blue color in the photo. I bought a soft case too, to protect them from dust and dirt when traveling in a backpack. Again, fast shipping, great packaging and quality product."
2,Works great!~ Clear when talking to people connected to my cell.
3,They lasted 2 days longer than the return period. One side doesn't work anymore except randomly when twisting the cheap cable at the base of the headset.
4,This is the first set of headphones that I bought for my Android phone and tablet. They are much lighter than stereo headphones that I used with my stereo system years ago. They have good sound.
5,I like the volume control feature on the headphones. I have a small head and they are almost too large - but I like them.
6,Bought these for myself they are great would recommend them to anyone
7,My daughter picked these for her birthday and is very pleased.
8,Broke after 3 uses.
9,Broke within the first day but I missed the return label deadline. üòï I honestly think I just got a lemon. I have several other pairs of this brands headphones and they are amazing. Wish I could have this issue made right.
0,Yes
1,Cheap and is not loud at all
2,"I ordered these for my teenage son. He really liked the sound, the long cord, and that they fold up."
3,"Supposed to be new, was not. Arrived unsealed, with plug broken, and someone's name written on the inside of the headband in LARGE black letters."
4,"Great for listening music from devices, wouldn't recommend for DJ use, not great with any outside sound cancelling. But it does what it's supposed to do."
5,"This are great headphones! They aren't very noise-cancelling, but they do have very good sound quality. I would give five stars, but the headphones are a little too big on my head, even when adjusted to the smallest position. I wish there was a way to make them tighter on my ears..."
6,"They really sound as good as the beats, I could not get them to fit well, to wide across the top of my head, wouldn't seat right"
7,It's ok for the price. Not super comfy to wear but they do the job.
8,"This item is one of the OK headphones I've ever had. And that's bad, the sound quality was decent and the outside noise is still unmuted. But it looks cool and worked fine...... until the jack got stuck inside of my phone and I had to pull the leftover part out of my phone, this was less than a month after I got it. üòµüòµüòµüòµüòµ"
9,Item as promised!
0,Works perfect as described and good quality.
1,very comfortable earpieces. I wear this around the house attached to my phone and when I am walking outside. I definitely recommend this product.
2,"For the price the best headphones we own. I got these for my daughter to use with Rosetta Stone, my son quickly confiscated them for use to listen to music. They now both want their own pair for listening to music. To them the quality is superior to earbuds I've spent twice the $ on."
3,"They look cool but the sound quality is lacking. They are also, apparently, not meant for people with large heads. I only got these since I can no longer wear earbuds but they're tight enough to give me a headache."
4,When they arrived they were far too wide for my head and kept falling off. They seem to broken already. Very disappointing.
5,great i love them
6,"I love these! They look trendy and sound good however, if the volume is loud others could hear it around you. I love making calls with these, I feel like I could hear the person in HD. Good buy for the price but the headband could be more adjustable they do fall off my head a bit."
7,"My granddaughter loves these headphones!!!! If she's happy, I'm happy!"
8,"worked great, but after about a year one side stopped working. Don't know why."
9,Great sound and easy to fold up and take where you are going. These headphones are very nice.
0,ya get what ya pay for. but they do the job
1,Left ear stopped working after 4 months. What a shame since they are comfortable and have good sound. Would not recommend since there are durability issues.
2,I received these quickly and I am very pleased with their performance and fit.
3,"They have a great sound quality and you can barely hear any outside noise when you put them on. Only thing is, I wish they were like my dad's sony ones because the ear pieces can flip out so you can listen to your music while being able to hear someone else.Instead you have it basically hanging off your head looking completely ridiculous."
4,Stopped working just after my return window ran out! Only used a month!
5,"Unfortunately when we opened the headphones, one didn't have the ear piece fully attached. Came off while trying to fully attach it, won't got back on."
6,They worked great..for 2 months. Then they didn't work anymore. Seemed like a weak wire connection.
7,I bought these for my 13 yr old son who had been wearing ear buds. He likes these headsets so much better. They are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. Great value fo the money
8,"Tween loved the look but the ear pads came off just past the one month mark, making them impossible to return. Wasted money."
9,Worked great.
0,Well it shipped and arrived very quickly which was the good thing . I had ordered these for my boyfriend and everything was great except for the headphones itself the volume went up and down it had great sound it was the volume and one of the speakers that were the problem .
1,"Use this with conference calls on my cell phone. Good sound quality and it reduces surrounding office noise. Plus the company contacted to to make sure I was happy with my purchase ... wow, actual customer service! I am very satisified"
2,"I should had paid more & got something better.as the sound I'd not that clear.
that you any way."
3,I bought these headphones for my daughter for Christmas and when she opened them and Tried them on the sound was really muffled and she couldn't hear anything. Worst gift ever!! DONT BUY!!!?
4,The fit is good. But there is a short an only one side of the headphones works unless you keep turning the cord until the other side works. An even then it only works for a couple minutes.
5,"cheap, cord broke at the plug. Buttons do not work with apple devises"
6,Perfect for my son
7,Noise isolation? Nuh-uh. Not a chance. The sound quality was meh. It didn't suck but it wasn't anything special either. It was comfortable and the cord was nice. 3 stars for mediocrity.
8,"I gave these earphones to my granddaughter. The button to pause and replay did not work. There were no paper instruction, but on the box it said what should happen with 1 click or 2 clicks or 3 clicks. I guess the button did not work because we did not get the stated results!"
9,Perfect.
0,Love that it folds up. Makes for easy storage. And yhe volume control helps with volume control without going into the settings of said device. Its a very good and cost efficient choice for headphones
1,My son got these for Christmas and he loves them with his new kindle fire hd...The cord is even made with a different material so that it does not fray.
2,Very comfortable
3,"I was super excited to find a pair of orange headphones, but I am sad to report they only lasted one trip. The foam around the earpiece has come off and I am not able to get it back in place. Now I have to purchase a new pair of headphones for the return trip home....... :-("
4,I ordered these headphones and in 2 days they are broken. No sound coming from them at all and I've tried everything I can to try and fix them. Very disappointed in this purchase. Save your money and don't buy these
5,"Within a couple months the padding fell off which we glued back on. Within six months, they are no longer working well. They will not connect well. My daughter can not hear out of both sides."
6,These headphones are very comfortable and the sound is very good.
7,Terrible product do not buy broke easily
8,"These only worked for about 2 weeks, then only the right side would work. Now neither side works. There is definitely a short in the cord somewhere. If I wiggle the cord around it will cut in and out but never stays playing."
9,"It was good for a while until it started randomly changing my songs and turning up and down the volume on my phone. I tried with other headphones to see if there was a bug in my phone, but the others worked normally. Its pretty much a piece of junk now."
0,"Less than a month after buying these headphones they suddenly decided to quit working.
They worked great when they did, but one morning they just wouldn't play any sound from any of my devices anymore.
Which really sucks because now I've got to go get new ones in the middle of the week when I commute 2 hours.

2 stars because they didn't break or anything, just quit."
1,"These headphones are great, especially for the price. I ordered 2 pair for my kids to use with their iPads for an upcoming plane trip. They look ""really cool"" according to my kids and the sound quality is good. They seem study and my kids have thrown them around quite a bit in and out of backpacks. They fit my 6 year old comfortably as well adults. I'm going to order a pair for myself and highly recommend these!

I do wish they came with a case, but it's hard to complain for less than $20."
2,"I really like these--love the color. They work well, are comfortable and a reasonable price. I bought these because I developed tinnitus (a constant ringing in your ears--yes, it's maddening). I don't know what caused it (could be a lot of different things), but I'm convinced for myself that wearing earbuds was a contributing factor; so I bought these."
3,"These are great! They block out sound so well, I don't want to use them for work because I want to be able to hear people coming up to my desk. If blocking out sound is your goal, these work wonderfully. They fold up great and the color, while listed as ""mint,"" is a pretty aqua/turquoise, just like the in picture. They are very comfy and love the cord covering. The only thing I would change is to have the volume control a little further down the cord (away from my face). I have not used it with my phone yet, this has just been on the computer."
4,"If I had my druthers, I'd hear every piece of music in KC's acoustically stunning Kauffman Center. But I'm a mayor with many responsibilities, which means I can't always have my druthers and frankly I'm not even sure what druthers are. What I do know is that these headphones are quite good. They're collapsible, which is convenient, and they come in a wide array of colors including one resembling Royal blue and four other colors that are not nearly as good."
5,Worked great at first but then slowly had problems - wiggling the wire worked to get them working again a few times and then they stopped working all together
6,"They were awesome when I first got them. I thought the durable cord would make for a long life span. Dead wrong! there was a short so annoying that I had to hold the cord in the most absurd positions including having to put it in my teeth to keep it from cracking out. It was like when I was a kid and had to all but hold the antenna up with tinfoil to get tv reception. (dear younger folks, that was before even cable) Annoying as hell so here I am looking to get a new pair in less than a couple months. Glad I waited to review these...."
7,I love everything about these headphones. They're very high quality. The cable is braided so I won't have to worry too much about it wearing down over time. The covers are very soft and make wearing them enjoyable. The sound quality is crystal clear and the microphone picks up perfectly. I'm really glad I found these! Definitely worth more than the price! Highly recommend!
8,"Was looking for an inexpensive set of comfortable over the ear headphones. Read the reviews and decided to give them a try. Thank you A-prime I had them quickly. So far they have worked great for casual listening around the house and for when I'm out walking my dog. Seem sturdy and well built. I especially like the braided cord. Very comfortable with above average sound quality. Even isolates you very well so you don't have to contend with ambient noise ruining the experience. I ordered the 'grey and mint' and reviews are spot on that it's a nice teal color. For $20, these are a steal. Very happy so far with my purchase."
9,My daughter loves them. Great sound and perfect price
0,"These arrived exactly as most of the reviews indicate. These are lightweight, have great sound. I love the extra long cord and the user buttons on the cord. The color is right on, I can't wait to use these on my next trip. For the price on these, you really can't beat them! Highly recommended."
1,Great headphones. Thank you
2,"These headphones were a perfect fit for our grandson and he loved them immediately. His mom liked the volume control.
Nothing against these headphones but I do wish I had gotten Bluetooth instead for this little guy. He likes to dance to his music which doesn't work well when you are tethered to your iPad."
3,kids love them
4,My son loved these! The only reason it is a 4 not a 5 is that the cord did pull out so they stopped working after about eight weeks so I felt like that part could have been a bit stronger. They look fun but are much cheaper than other similar headphones.
5,My son loves it. He uses it at school and home. It is very comfortable.
6,They were great thanks
7,Present for granddaughter. She loved.
8,My son told me this headphone is great! The sounds is very good.
9,"Very comfortable; much more comfortable than the ones they replaced. The sound quality is good, as well (I use this with my iPads)."
0,These are great headphones - they drown out the noise around me at work and the playback sound is great!
1,"I love using these headphones, the sound quality is top notch and having a volume adjuster and being able to skip/pause songs is great. There is a function to go back to the last song but I haven't been able to do that not that I've needed to though."
2,"Great for the price. The band is a little longer than I expected and not quite as padded as I'd like. They work well and sound good, though."
3,Very happy with the purchase!! Good quality product and the sound is just right! Packaging is cool also. Thanks a lot.
4,"I bought these for my daughter and she‚Äôs used them for less than 2 months and they already have a short in them. I love the color and the design, but they are useless since they don‚Äôt work."
5,yes i recieved package thank you
6,"Bought these for our 5 year old to use. Fit is good, they fold up nicely. They have stopped working after only 6 months of infrequent use. Sound hasn't been great from the beginning, now you can barely hear through them and they cut out all the time."
7,"Much nicer quality and only a few dollars more than other kids' headphones at about this price point that I had previously purchased at Target. My 6-year old loves them. They fold, which I didn't expect, and makes it a bit easier to fit in a backpack."
8,My daughter loves them. They work really well and she loves the color.
9,The headphones where great but the wiring was pretty bad and the wire in the grey cored came loose inside and they no longer worked
0,Stopped working within a few weeks.
1,Broke very quickly - only one side has sound now. They broke after 5 weeks.
2,The headphones look nice but the sound coming out of the left ear is 2-3 times louder than the right ear. What a joke. I wasn't expecting much for $20 something dollars but at least make the sound level the same in each ear.
3,"Perfect. light weight, very comfortable, sound incrediable !"
4,These are great headphones!
5,Love the available colors and they have a really good sound for inexpensive headphones. The only problem I had and the reason I had to return them is the earpieces were too small and hurt my ears if I wore them for any length of time
6,Pretty good for the price. The ear flaps are pretty small so they hurt after a while. Used for a 7year old.
7,Really cute. Slightly loose on me and don't seem particularly adjustable. Unfortunately the arrive with a broken headphone jack (literally looked like it was busted off) so I didn't get to try them. Going to try a different brand.
8,they seem real good so far
9,"Headphones exactly as describes. Good sound and love having volume control in the cord, esp. for the commercials on Spotify. It makes them so easy to avoid ;)"
0,My daughter has these for about 2 weeks before they broke.
1,"They don't get any bigger... The sound quality is ok i guess... The wire doesn't come off. If you're looking for something thats like ""meh"" then this is it!"
2,My grandsons love them and I also get a break from hearing the loud sounds of their games.
3,"GREAT DELIVERY, VOLUME ON COMPUTER WAS NEVER THAT LOUID, IM LITTLE HARD OF HEARING PUT THESE NEW AILIHEN C-8 PHONES ON AND WOW THE VOLUME WAS SO LOUD I HAD TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN.THEY ARE LIGHT WEIGHT COMFORTABLE IM A VERY HAPPY CAMPER AND WILL HIGHLY RECCOMEND THESE THANK YOU. PS ALSO VERY CLEAR SOUND AND NO STATIC"
4,I bought these for my son to use while using the computer at school. He loves them.
5,"I love these headphones! The sound is very clear, volume adjustment is great, and they are super comfortable! I've worn them all day at work and on several long flights! As other people mentioned the mint green color is more of a teal, but they're very pretty. Great product overall, but even better for how affordable they are."
6,Great sound quality
7,These headphones have been great for late night music listening sessions. My bedroom is situated under a 3 year old (upper flat tenants) so listening to music after 8pm has been a no go. I wasn't looking to spend much and these were everything I needed in headphones. Would recommend.
8,super
9,They worked great for two months using them everyday at work and now the right earpiece no longer works. It gives me a headache when I try to listen to music having only one side of the headphones working. Do not recommend purchasing this product.
0,These work better than expected! 9 year old loves that there is controls on the cord to pause. Comfortable fit and good quality for the price.
1,Nice lightweight headphones that work great.
2,"Work great, a little to big for my head."
3,Great headphones for the price! Comfortable and great sound. Have been using for a few weeks and experienced no problems with them.
4,Pretty cool. My kid loves them. !!!
5,Beautiful color & very lightweight headphones . I bought them as a Christmas gift for my son.
6,My daughter love it!!!
7,"Great at first, but quickly started shorting out somewhere internally; first one ear, then the other."
8,I bought as a gift for my granddaughter. She loves them!
9,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas, and one side stopped working in the middle of February - she didn't even get two whole months of use from them."
0,"Worked wonderfully for about twoish months. I wore them everywhere, but suddenly now the left ear is fading out if I turn my head at all. I do like them and I'm really bummed to have issues. Wore them to work out, go to work, and just hang around the house. Maybe should have gotten the protection plan or something."
1,Light weight. Great sound and very nice quality for price. I have 2 sets and highly recommend this product. They are very well padded and very comfortable. I have several piercings in both ears and have a hard time with ear buds.
2,I bought these in replacement of a pair that had a separated cord. I like the sound quality and the folding option. However I did find the material that touched the over the ear uncomfortable from time to time depending on where it's creased
3,Good enough for my middle schooler. They fit very confortable and like the feature of been able to control the volume.
4,My granddaughter absolutely loves these headphones. They were delivered when expected and at a very good price.
5,Was great for a week and the stopped working completely .Save your money and get a different brand
6,Works good.
7,"Comfortable, reasonably priced and works well! Win!!!"
8,love it
9,Work excellent!
0,"This is a great basic pair of headphones. I wear them while walking so that I can listen to music or talk on the phone. When it is really windy, it gets noisy, but other than that, no problems."
1,After wearing them for a while my ears start to hurt
2,"You get what you pay for. 2 months after purchase, one of the ear pieces no longer produces any sound. Trying to fiddle with cable connections didn't produce any change. I think these are ultimately a pretty cheaply made pair of headphones. But at this price I should have known..."
3,Great headset. My daughter really loves it. Cuts out outside noise and sound is wonderful compared to the kids headphones that are out in stores.
4,"Update:
After just a few months the microphone stopped working which was main reason for purchase. Disappointing.. They still sound good just can't use them for work calls any more..
;-(

LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!! Except my ears get hot.. other than that.. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES"
5,I got these for my wife. She LOVES them! A great buy!
6,Husband was not happy with these and we are sending them back Sorry
7,"I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them. This is my honest opinion."
8,"Don't bother buying these. They are cute headphones, but I only used them twice and the left ear stopped working."
9,"Bought these for my 11-year-old, who loves them. I like that the cord is thick and sturdy, he likes the microphone in the switch. Good headphones for kids."
0,"Perfect size for my 7 & 10 year old. The cord is extremely flexible, but durable, not just plastic - and the sound is great! Very happy with this product."
1,Purchased for a child who just had to have beats. Comparing reviews and prices purchased these and he loves them. They are stylish and great quality.
2,Great sound and I particularly like the coard ( more durable)
3,"We bought these for my daughter for Christmas, and they are already broken. Plus the window to return has closed. A HUGE waste of money. Products should last longer than 2 months, even if they aren't top of the line products."
4,Very happy with my new head [hones
5,I got these for my uncle and he loves them!!! Didn't take long to get them and he has used them about every day sense then. Every time I see him he has them on. I had to show him to turn the volume up but other than that perfect!!
6,"They‚Äôre cute and comfortable, but if you want them for longer then 2 months, don‚Äôt waste your money on these. The button on them broke and randomly pause and skip songs. Now I have to hold the cord a certain way for the audio to sound right. Waste of money."
7,"Tried 2 of these. Just not durable. The first one was broke (the jack) when it arrived. We gave it a second chance and that one lasted about a week before the jack bent and broke off from normal use.

Sound was nice but just not durable."
8,"Great quality for the price and I love the unique color. Sounds are clear and my students can hear me easily with the built-in mic. So far, so good!!"
9,Nice sound and color
0,"Purchased for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them! The sound quality is pretty good, very clear and live. The color is amazing. Happy with this purchase."
1,Comfortable and fits perfect. Light weight and is adjustable.
2,Can not beat for the price outstanding.
3,"super set, very heard of hearing Amplies well hightly recommended"
4,"You won't be disappointed with these. Comfortable, cool color options, options, and the price won't bankrupt you."
5,"Very nice looking headphones. I bought these for my 6 year old daughter and they fit her very well. So far, we've had no issues with this set. We did purchase the bright green for my son and he's having issues with the sound."
6,"Granddaughter loved the color , great buy"
7,"These were for my daughters class, they weren't adjustable to her head as she has a smaller head. I tried them on and they didn't grip around my ears like I thought they should. I get they wouldn't fit her head, but they should have fit mine just fine."
8,Headphones aren't tight enough on the head and easily slip off. They also have a mind of their own and click on siri or change the song while wearing them. I wouldn't buy them again.
9,Product did not last very long. The connector and the cord began to separate after about 3 weeks.
0,Bought for my kid to hook up in the back of the car if she doesn't want to listen to what we are and she absolutely loves them
1,"These headphones broke after roughly 45 days of use. The connection started to go bad, until it stopped making connection all together. Steer clear of this item."
2,Great product and right on time!
3,"Not happy that I could barely hear any sound
Returned."
4,Great for the price!!
5,"Ordered one for my husband and one for me. We both like them a lot. We use them for watching TV and have to clip the microphone button down or they won't work with the splitter. But otherwise, they deliver good sound. It's nice to have individual volume control, too."
6,"Sound quality was good. Dropped them once while at my desk and the whole right side broke off. Not durable at all, also they fit a bit loose."
7,"Purchased this for my son who loved it until 2 weeks later the tip of the plug became slightly bent and the headphones are no longer usable. He used these almost every day during those two weeks, so I'm not sure if it's a question of quality or durability. Very disappointing."
8,I got these for my 9 year old daughter and she loves them. They are comfortable for her and a great quality for the price!
9,"Got these as a replacement for daughters old headphones, she loves them and every night after work I have to take them off the bed and place them on her stand. Thank you"
0,"Awful headphones. The buttons to lower volume and pause/play songs stopped working after 2 weeks. A month and a half later, one side doesn't always work (I have to twist the cable around to get sound in both ears and it doesn't come out often).
Total waste of money. Honestly if you can afford it, buy Sennheisers or some other brand of headphones. These ones are straight garbage.
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
1,"These are great headphones for the money. You really can't hear any outside noise when you put them on. The ear pieces are very comfortable and they feel like really sturdy headphones.
The buttons work great with an iPhone 6s. The volume knob is a little useless as it is independent from the volume on the iphone. The mic sounds great and the function button works as stated.
The only thing I would change is the cord. I would have a detachable cord and also a carrying case for travel."
2,"I've been extremely pleased with my AILIHEN C8 Folding Headphones with Microphone...!!! Awesome sound quality and comfortable fit, easy to adjust. My only regret is that I did not get around to giving the seller, AILIHEN, at least 5 Stars! The headset arrived promptly and was packaged very securely to help prevent any damage in transit. My sincere apologies to the folks at AILIHEN for my neglect."
3,"These worked well when I first bought them 3 months ago, but now the wire at the headphone jack is damaged and I can't hear out of one ear. I dropped these headphones once two months ago, and these defects are happening now. They're just ok. For 20 bucks, I can afford to get another.

Oh, if you wear glasses, then don't wear these headphones for long periods of time. They press against the frames of the glasses and squeezes your head. Ouch."
4,"Purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loved them. She is a musician so that is a compliment. However, after two months the wire came loose and she was sad because the sound would cut in and out. I contacted the company to see what we could do. They sent us a replacement pair! Great customer service. The new phones came fast! Now my daughter is happy again. Thanks."
5,"I like this headset. It looks and feels really expensive. It has great noise cancelling and isn‚Äôt too tight on my ears. The sound is perfect too. The cushion on the ears are soft and very comfortable. Even though it has a cord, I like it over the wireless headsets I have tried. No charging necessary, plug in and it works."
6,"If I could give it a zero, I would. This is a very cheap item and I do not recommend it at all. I bought 2 of them at the same time, one for each of my children. The first pair broke within the 1st week and the other pair broke within the 3rd week. The plug is very weak and both of them broke while plugged into an iPad!! The plug is buried into the headphone jack so I have to figure out a way to get the broken piece out! I compared the plug with a Sony pair of headphones I got years ago and I immediately saw the difference. The Sony plug is very thick and would not be easy to break. This Ailihen headphone, on the other hand, has a plug that is very thin and apparently made out of very cheap metal and plastic."
7,"I just got them at the start of January, not even 3 months and I have to get a replacement because only one side works. I bought these for work, I never traveled with them or threw them in a bag or folded them much for that matter. They were plugged into my computer at my desk since they were opened. I guess you get what you pay for."
8,"My 5 yr old son loves these, maybe because one of the kids from Walk the Prank had similar looking ones. But, my son wears them even when their not plugged into anything. Lol! They do cancel a lot of the outside noise he says and he likes how comfy they are on his head."
9,"Superb headphones! Great bass, excellent noise cancellation. Controls are awesome, I can do everything without having to touch my ipod or phone. Wire is different texture, but helps prevent snag and tangling. Loved mine so much I bought one for mothers day!"
0,"i would like to say out of all the headphones i bought, these are the best functioning. the only minor problem i have is that it sometimes pauses/plays videos and music on its own and summons siri. often than that it is awesome."
1,They were great.... for a week but they are staticky already. The sound comes in and out. I've taken great care of them as well. I'm very sad/disappointed.
2,Exactly what I was looking for our grandson!!
3,"My headphones are great! I can hear my music perfectly clear, Great sounds, easy to adjust the volume, a reasonable length of cord, forward switch and beautiful happy colors‚Ä¶ What more can you ask for?"
4,"I wanted to love these, because they sounded great, felt great, and my kids liked them. Unfortunately, they didn't last. After just a few weeks they started shorting out and sound goes on and off. Haven't checked into a warranty or refund yet."
5,I liked these headphones at first......however they eventually stopped working after around a month.
6,Wonderful headphones! Purchased these as a gift for my son and lately I've also been using them to listen to my online college course. I'm able to listen and focus on my class without hearing what is going on around me. These headphones are also very comfortable. Great product. Both my son and I love them!
7,I love the color. I like how soft they are. But. I‚Äôm an adult and I have fairly tiny ears but these are still just a little too small. They put too much pressure on my ears and the sound quality is already beginning to fade after 1 month.
8,They are just what i was looking for.
9,My daughter use these all the time and the end broke off about three weeks later and it is stuck in the iPad.
0,A bargain. Impressive headphones I wasn't expecting such good quality of sound especially for the price. Highly recommend.
1,Item was fine
2,These headphones are amazing and the sound quality is superb!!!
3,Good for gaming
4,Great their not to loud
5,"My son loves this product! He says that it works fantastically and there are no flaws. These headphones can fold, making it easy to store. The color is very nice; it isn't as bright as it is in the picture. I would recommend buying this product if you want an affordable choice for headphones."
6,They're ok. Not adjustable so slips off head. Sound quality ok but not great with volume or blocking outside noise
7,"Loved the color, it was definitely not that BRIGHT blue and I don't mind that at all. I must say that if you have a small head they might be slightly loose but they still have an amazing noise and a cool folding feature and are super comfy!"
8,"Fit comfortably over my ears and I wear glasses. Music sounds crisp, like meditation music or nature sounds, but any words or lyrics in a song sound very far away."
9,"Completely loved them, worked great with really clear sound, unfortunately after 1 month they stopped working all of a sudden, very disappointed as they were a Christmas gift for my 15 year old son"
0,"So far, it is working good. I like the color and model. Of course, for that price, you get what it is fair."
1,"Kids love them and they're holding up really well. From backpacks to school, at school and home again."
2,They are for a salvation army angel tree gift so I don't know for sure but certainly appear of great quality!
3,"Really disappointed in these headphones. I gave them to my daughter for Christmas and she loved them, but after using them for about a month, they shorted out and no longer work."
4,"My child loves them, it was his birthday gift...13th...nope don't have to have beats! Great price, great sound, and insulated very well so we aren't listening to his stuff also :)"
5,"My son was thrilled to get these! He wears them around the house even when he isn't listening to tunes! They fit well, are light and comfortable to wear (obviously!) and I would buy them again."
6,"Love it, clarity and comfort is outstanding."
7,These headphones are great. My kids love them.
8,"Worked great and had good sound, but after less than 2 months, the soft ear cover fell off and the wire is compromised and only plays in one ear. Headphones were cared for so I am assuming it is faulty construction. Would not recommend this purchase."
9,Awesome as described
0,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. They were not mishandled, yet the cord broke within 2 months. Will not replace with these."
1,My daughter loves them
2,No problems so far
3,Nice design my 6yrs boy likes it a lot. Reduce Volume control is nice thing for little one like him!
4,Warning: The headphones are not adjustable. It is only one size. And the sound was off. It seems like it was off balanced. One side was lower than the other.
5,MY 7 YEAR OLD LOVES THESE HEADPHONES
6,"I liked this pair, but after about 6 months, the left side when on the fritz and then a few weeks the whole thing died."
7,"The headphones worked at first but if you're someone like me and can somehow go through headphones and earphones fast, this isn't really for you. After a few weeks, the sound wasn't working properly and I had to put the cord in a certain angle so it can work."
8,My kids love these and they were actually better qualitiy than I expected. I think I need a pair as well.
9,"My daughter has been using these headphones for about 2 weeks and she loves them. Unfortunately, one of the ear pieces has stopped working. So disappointed because we leave for vacation in 4 days and she was hoping to take them on the trip."
0,"doubt you can beat these for $20. Sound good, comfortable, decent volume controls. Arrived super fast especially considering shipped for free. Adjustable so they fit my big head lol. Would buy again..."
1,These are perfect for kids or adults. The volume only goes so loud. Which is nice for kids. They work well and sound good.
2,They stopped working after a month
3,"My 10 year old son loves these. Comfortable, clear, not so isolated that when I cal him he can't hear me, that's ok with me :-). Easy to carry around, look cool, great product for the price. However, 2 months later the ear piece came off so I removed 2 stars"
4,"Unless I hold the wire at a certain angle, the sound will only play on one side (left). It‚Äôs very disappointing... I guess I‚Äôll have to go look for new headphones.
(I received this earphone on 12/16 and only used it once on 12/17.)"
5,Didn't last a month.
6,they fit nicely and look great. The sound is great and its easy on the ears
7,I just recently bought these. Speedy delivery. Sound quality is great they are very comfortable and when it comes to storing them I love that they fold up! Great buy would for sure buy again if need be.
8,üëç
9,The item was purchased as a gift. Everything looked great from outside the box. The item arrived almost a week later than expected. However when it arrived it was exactly what was ordered and nothing appeared damaged.
0,It's really really nice product but it was big on my head! so i'm returning it :((((
1,This is a Christmas present for my teenage daughter. The color is wonderful and I love how the earpieces fold inward. My package arrived on time and in excellent condition. Buying another pair for my other daughter
2,Work great
3,These headphones are exactly what we needed for my son. Great quality for the price.
4,"These work really well and the price was great. I'm only giving three stars though because the black lining started to come out on both sides. I was able to get in back in, but it was pretty difficult."
5,"Works, good sound quality. Pausing from the ""pause"" button initiates a fade-out stop--nice to not be so abrupt and leave your ears ringing. Can get a little uncomfortable on ears after wearing for about 4+ continuous hours."
6,Love the colors. Works well with my Galaxy S7
7,It was perfect and arrived on time!
8,"My son really likes these headphones. They are comfortable and he's happy with the quality of the sound. Color is super fun and they seem pretty sturdy overall. My other son likes them and for the price, might buy himself a pair."
9,Grandchild loves them
0,"Comfortable, nice sound insulation but poor cable quality stop working right after 2 weeks"
1,These stop working within 2 weeks of buying.
2,"Sturdy yet soft & very comfortable to wear. Nice sound. Does a good job dampening environmental sounds, so you don't have to turn the volume way up in order to hear your program. We got the lime green & white; the colors of the item are exactly as shown in the product description."
3,Lasted a whole month sounding perfectly . now ive lost hearing in one of the headphones which is rather annoying.
4,"Within a two week period, only one side produced sound. Amazon returned my money."
5,"One side stopped working after 13 months of regular (but gentle) use. Otherwise, it was a perfect set of affordable, comfortable, good-sounding headphones. I really wish it lasted longer."
6,"Just purchased these last week and not only were they early(I wasn't due to get them until Tuesday), but they came in some great shape.

They are very comfortable around my head, which is nice, and the mic works great!"
7,These are awesome for the price! Great sound quality!
8,These are a Christmas gift for my 7 year old daughter so I have no idea of the sound quality or durability yet but they seem to be a very good product for the money.
9,"Pleasantly suprised for the price. Good mix between mids, lows, and highs"
0,"I really like these. My gym is super loud and I like to walk and watch shows on the treadmill, I can really really my shows with these. Unlike my earbuds."
1,Purchased these for my 10 yr old son and he seems to like them.
2,Got these for my 11 year old daughter. She seems to like them very much and wears them quite a bit without ever complaining about discomfort. They seem to be reasonably well built so a good buy for the money. I would recommend them.
3,GREAT SOUND!! WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
4,Quite nice exactly what I needed for a good price.
5,My son loves these
6,My daughter loves hers.
7,These were true to color and my granddaughter loves them.
8,"These were a great value at only $20 - They cancel noise pretty well, but after more than a few hours of continual wear, it can feel like theyre crushing your ears. Sound quality is great, non-rubbery cord for fewer tangles!"
9,"Would be five stars if sound came out of both speakers.
Pros: Great fit (soft and light on the ears), compact design folds up, and optional volume control/mic button.
Cons: I can barely hear noise out of the right headphone. Might try returning for another try."
0,These were for my grandson for back to school. He loved them so much that I ordered another pair for my granddaughter in purple. Thanks for the quality of these headphones!
1,Too much plastic. Horrible ear cups. Sound quality sucks.
2,A little uncomfortable. The sound quality is decent. I would buy them for a back up pair or a pair you just use it you don‚Äôt want to lose another pair on a trip or something. Would I buy from these again? Eh probably.
3,these are fine for the price.
4,Sound great
5,Nice for the price. Everything I was expecting. Very happy with the purchase.
6,Got these for my son for school. He loves them and really likes the volume control on the wire. They seem like they are well made!
7,"There is a reason it is very cheap. It is very uncomfortable and hard for your ears, and it looks big but its not, and however adjusting it is a real pain because you have to have the biggest head in the world to wear this."
8,My son bought these with his own money. These lasted a month before the sound starting going in and out then became static.
9,"The headphones were exactly what they said,they would be they look and feel great and the sound is amazing as the price was. I also loved how fast they arrived despite it being Christmas time as some sellers are using that as a reason for items taking longer"
0,Son loved them
1,"these were for my grandaughter,she uses them everyday,would order again"
2,"Great buy on these headphones. They fold up easily, braided cord, volume adjuster and noise reduction. Sturdy for a 7 year old and great color choices! Very happy with the purchase."
3,So far so good. I use it almost every day and I had no regrets about buying them. Hear perfectly clear and definitely seems like I can't hear anything outside of these headphones. I love it.
4,"I bought this headphone for my son and he loves it, I also love it, the wire is not the normal wire that comes with all headsets these are more clothy and strong which is what I love most, I'm looking into getting the earphones for myself.üòÉ"
5,works better than expected
6,Good quality made nice sound
7,"Good price, easy to use, ear pieces fold down for easy storage. Liked the color choices."
8,"I want to love these...but the cord broke with normal use, and they no longer work!"
9,It is good but I can not find the microphone and the pad for the left side is very loose and you can see the glue used to glue the side. I think it was just mine. Otherwise it is very comfortable and the audio is very good.
0,I ordered these for my 2 kids for a long airplane ride to Europe. One set broke on the way over (you could not hear anything unless the wire was held taut in a certain way... a huge disappointment for my son who now had no headphones on the trip). I returned them when we got home and then repurchased another pair thinking it was a fluke since the other pair had worked fine. Needless to say within a few weeks the second pair stopped working and then the replaced pair stopped working. That is 3 broken headsets in a 2 month span; totally unacceptable. Don't waste your money.
1,"I really enjoyed the comfortable fit of these headphones. Unfortunately the pair I received were faulty at the microphone attachment and when I contacted the company for a replacement pair, after several emails, they only sent me a refund. The sound quality was really lovely and I would have been very happy with just a working replacement pair."
2,"I'm not a headphone aficionado or anything, I just like stuff that works well and looks cool. These headphones are better than I expected in both departments. I just got back from a trip across the country and the headphones were great for listening to music and dampening ambient noises on the plane. The braided cable is really nice; it seems significantly more durable than the cables of other headphones I've owned. The option to fold them down for storage was also quite handy. Altogether, it's a really solid product for the price point."
3,"I like them but the problem I had with them was that sometimes, when you hit the top part of it while listening to music, you'll hear this loud resounding noise as well as it hits your ears. That shouldn't happen but other than that, they're okay."
4,"Sound quality was ok got the price Idk what I was expecting but probablylike a month in I noticed the Jack piece of the head phones that plugged into my phone was cracked, so they don't work anymore Idk it was possibly my fault, can't really give a good review since I didn't have long with them."
5,"They look like they're for children, and I was led to believe that they would fit my 9 year old's head, but they didn't. So my mother took them. She liked them, and they fit better. I bought new ones from the same company that many people put in the comments were small enough for smaller heads."
6,"These are really great. they have excellent sound and I tested them on music and video on my tablet. The only design flaw I see is that they are a bit stiff so if I lay back with them I feel them push up a bit. For normal everyday use, however, these definitely do exactly what i needed. I will be testing the mic later - but I have no doubt it'll work just fine."
7,"Order came as expected. Color was as advertised. Cord is fabric coated, so something to keep in mind if you're tough on your headphones. These were a good deal overall, the treble is a little tin-y, the bass is not very deep, but present enough. The treble is fair the sound overall is fairly crisp and clean. For such large headphones the sound exuded from them seems much smaller, the the tin can effect. These are not sound proof or sound dampening headphones. Also the sound does go outwards and you can clearly head the noise if you're not wearing them. Overall I would say these are affordable, stylish headphones. I would recommend them to a friend. I would also consider repurchasing them. Cheer.s"
8,"Updated review -
Purchased these for my son in February 2017. By June 2017 one head phone no longer had sound anymore. Per seller and headphone box there is a 6-12 month warranty. Messaged seller in June 2017 to see if they asssist with the warranty or I need to go directly through the manufacturer. It's now August 2017 and the seller have never responded to my inquiry/issue.

My initial review February 2017 - ""Great quality and sound. My 8 year old is using them for computer work at school. He loves them. His dad says the sound quality is just as good as his $200 Beats. Will definitely buy again."""
9,"Theses a great headphones. Love the color, they are adjustable for adults and kids! Not five stars because when you bend the wire, at all, the should will cut out. Totally recommend theses headphones, but just beware of the cord issue."
0,"The product is alright. It looks fantastic, and the microphone is great. However, it is not very comfortable on the ears if you're going to wear them for a while, putting pressure on your ears. I wish they were slanted just a little bit, and then they'd be great!"

3,"The sound is great for $20, and the microphone works well. I use them with the PS4 and the only part that gets annoying is the volume adjustment. It just doesn't have a happy medium between no sound and loud sound. Still, the volume isn't insanely loud, and I can still use the headphones, so 5/5."
