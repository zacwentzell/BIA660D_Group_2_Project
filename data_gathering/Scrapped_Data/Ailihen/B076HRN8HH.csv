0,"Deep bass, my music sounds awesome through these headphones!! Super pleased with these! Sometimes you just want to plug in a set of headphones and not worry about charging or bluetooth, and these fit the bill!

Exterior sound cancellation is great, can't hear someone talking right next to you.

I didn't realize these folded when I bought them, which is a great plus. Makes storing them a breeze when not using them.

The metallic brushed pink color with white earpieces makes the set look very high end. I love them!"
1,"I am very impressed with these headphones. My husband bought me similar headphones a year ago (Sony brand for almost $100) and I actually think these are just as comfortable if not more. Plus, they're pretty! Whereas, my other headphones are black and boring. Since my children are always using my other headphones I decided it was time to give another set a try. Originally these were going to be for my daughters, however, now they are mine. :) I highly recommend you try these!

If my review has helped you in any way please feel free to click the helpful button for me. Thanks!"
2,"I really love these headphones. I have a giant head and it is quite tough to find headphones that fit over my head and don't pinch at the top but these are great. The inside top of the band is nicely padded for comfort and the padded ears make wearing them even for long periods quite comfortable. They adjust easily and fully cover the ear to block out surrounding sounds. The cord is sturdy and plenty long for most uses. The color is very pretty as well. The sound is nothing spectacular, but they're great for listening to audiobooks, videos, etc.

Overall, these are comfortable, attractive, and have good sound and I certainly recommend them."
3,"I am stunned by the sound quality of these earphones. The bass is ripping, the highs are clear and piercing but not tinny. I listen mostly to rock music though am a big fan of acoustic flamenco."
4,"The sound quality is nice on these and the cord is a nice length! I use them primarily for watching shows on my phone and listening to nature sounds before bed.
The only negative is that they don't have a way to adjust the volume or pause/play the music! Otherwise, very nice headphone for the price!"
5,"These are amazing! Gorgeous & sleek, extremely comfortable, sound quality is beyond phenomenal and they fold together for easy storage/carrying. I honestly am SO impressed with these, especially for the price. My husband and my son also agree, even though their rose gold/pink, both of them steal these from me every chance they get, they love them!!! I’ll be buying them both a pair very soon! Highly recommend!!!"
6,"I have to admit, I bought these for the color only. But wow, I was surprised at how good they sound. I use them with my digital piano and the sound is rich, clear and they have just enough bass. They are comfortable even after a couple hours."
7,"I was looking for a pink one at first, but changed my mind once I saw this one. This headphone looks exactly like the picture, and prettier! It is a soft and beautiful rose gold color, and I like that the headband is adjustable and very lightweight. I have to say I brought it for the color at first, but now I love it. Great quality and very affordable!"
8,Headphones have a great sound quality to them. Great fit that’s perfect for my 14 year old. Love that the cord is on one side.
9,These earphones are not sturdy and the wires are not good!
10,"I bought a pair of these for my daughter a couple months back, and after only a few weeks they begin to fail. Oddly enough, you could only hear the background music and not the lead vocals. Weird failure, but it was directly attributable to the headphones. I then ordered a second set of thinking the first ones might’ve just been defective, this time the left speaker kept fading in and out. You could readjust the headphone jack to get it to work, but it was certainly not reliable. I tried to headphones on other devices and found the same issues, so it’s not the device my daughter is using. I won’t be buying another set of these, but will be exploring other options."
11,"I love the color. The print on the box said that there is an inline microphone, surprised me because I specifically didn't want a mic and ordered this because there wasn't one. It doesn't have one, which I'm happy with. The cord isn't much longer than earbuds cords, it could use another foot if you're using it with a PC."
12,"I'm very disappointed in these headphones, I loved them when I first got them but I've had them for less than two months and the sound quality has already deteriorated. I'm guessing that the internal wires are loose, as whenever I move my head slightly the sound fades and becomes distorted. I only use these at home while studying, they are not subjected to a lot of wear-and-tear."
13,Got this for my son to use at school. Sounds pretty good and I like how the cord is a shoestring material and that they are foldable hoping it will last longer then his last pair I bought him
14,These are great headphones for the price! They fold up compact allowing for travel. They have a rope cord which feels quite sturdy. The blue matches the image perfectly. They earmuffs aren't the comfiest but they fit well on my son who is using them. They have great sound with great base.
15,"Very nice. These are comfortable to wear and soft on the ears. They are adjustable on the head to accommodate for different shapes. The sound that projects from the speakers is clear. They work with my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. I look forward to using them when I travel."
16,"Really good sound and comfortable fit, I use them at the gym and they don’t get super sweaty. The jack has extra metal around it, I assume to protect from bending? Great for the price.

Please note, there are no controls on these headphones."
17,Broken within weeks...
18,"These headphone lasted me a little over a month before I could no longer hear out of one ear. The sounds isn't great, and I've found that they seem to absorb all the noise of the wind. The color is cute, the cord on the headphones is white fabric, so it both gets dirty, and starts to get messed up at the point of connection for your device and the cord really fast."
19,I know my cousin like the rosegold headphone. I decided to buy it as a gift for her. She loves it. She told be this is what she need it in a while. Good base. Easy to use. You can fold it to make it smaller so you can bring it anywhere you want.
20,it has only been less then 3 month and 1 side of the headphones don't work. My son is 9 and he takes very good care of his electronics . I am very disappointed I have no clue how people rated these a 4 star I would not recommend these for anyone. Its only an matter of time before I have to replace my daughters who ahs the same pair just different color
21,"I use these headphones with my Casio keyboard. The sound quality is great. They are fully adjustable and they feel good on my head. They look good too, the picture is accurate for both the color and the product."
22,Sound is pretty good. Its comfortable for extended usage. Colors are as is. Good so far.
23,These work quite well! I love the color and it’s great to play music. I’ve been using it for weeks now and I still love it. I’m planning to get another one for my sister. Good sound quality and lovely color.
24,"I mostly liked these. But now the sound will cut out on one side or the other and it's jarring. Sometimes both sides will work together, but usually it's just one or the other now. It's sad. Also it's not as noise cancelling as I hoped. Which is a bummer, because I thought otherwise they were really good. Haven't had trouble with the chord at all."
25,"Initial review. Great sound, easy to peer, weight is low so you do not feel you wear a headset as much as with my old crappy Beats Wireless. Work great with just the audio cable too, which is nice."
26,I have to say these headphones are quality and the sound is so crisp and clear. The band is also comfortable and adjustable. They also collapse which is great. I’m buying more for family and friends.
27,I bought this girls headphone for my friend's daughter as a birthday gift. she absolutely loves it! And when she receive it just screaming for excitement. I am so glad with this purchase.
28,"I love this headphone a lot. This style very fashion, -and the colors is so beautiful! That is a gift for my friend. She loves it. -Also the musical quality very high. It is the best headphone I used."
29,"Great sound from a not too expensive headphone. The deep bass makes my music sound great.
I'm very pleased with these, and the sound cancellation is a great plus!"
30,These work great. I homeschool and needed some over the ear ones for their computer classes. The sound is nice and they are very comfortable for kids and adults.
31,Not what I expected plus they are small and uncomfortable.
32,"Purchased the rose gold to my teenage daughter, she likes it very much. Pretty color, decent stylish design, very good sound quality, comfortable ear buds. Great for this price."
33,"The color I selected (purple) didn't turn out the way it looked in the picture. It looks more like a blue color, although I still like the color. When I wear the headphones for too long, my ears start to hurt from the pressure of the hard fabric. Otherwise, the sound is good quality, I like the cord (although I wish it was a bit longer) and they are okay quality. I would buy something else if you are a gamer, otherwise, they're fine."
34,"These headphones are really cute! While they don't have a lot of bass, they seem quite well made, and I won't hesitate to use them."
35,Amazing rose gold color! My daughter loves it. The sound quality is good when she watches youtube videos. The length of the cord is enough for daily use as well.
36,These are VERY nice not cheap looking or feeling. One suggestion I have is I would like them to be a little smaller to fit my skinny head. They adjust well to my husbands large head so he will be getting his own pair. NOT cheaply made.
37,"its Ok nothing special, I actually just brought it for my nieces and nephews to use when they are watching videos on the tablet"
38,These headphones are so comfortable to wear and came diligently packaged. They are just as described and are very true to the color posted! They fold up really nicely and are adjustable!
39,"I was a little worried to buy some cheaper no name brand headphones but at the same time couldn't justify to spend hundreds of $$$$ for the big brands...typical female as I am I ordered them because I loved the way they looked! But omg the pictures on Amazon do them no justice!!!! I had to upload my own to show them off!!!! They look and sound high end! I bought the rose gold and they are a little on the pink side which is perfect for me, but teenage boys may not like that..."
40,I love this kind of Headphones，and it can cover ur ear so that prevent ur ear from freezing，and it has very good tone quality，the important thing is cheep！
41,"Headset are convenient to carry, perfect for backpack, sound quality is, you know, not bad for this price, my little girl really like this."
42,"I love them. I cannot say enough good things about them. The color is adorable, they comfortable, the sound quality is amazing...I would highly HIGHLY recommend them. Good price and great quality. They block out the sound around me and allow me to focus on what I need to."
43,"I received these for my 3 yr old son. I was really hopeful they would fit his small had, but they are to big. They say large inside, so I'm disappointed there. I did try them on trying to make them smaller and they sound fanatic. The color is nice I just thought they would be smaller. My girlfriend has a pair for her daughter that are much smaller same brand and they fit my son perfect, a size choice when ordering isn't available so if you need a small pair beware they are not small..."
44,"In our house you cannot have too many headphones, and these are certainly a crowd pleaser. They are sturdy and will likely hold up to a simultaneous sister grab."
45,"These are great headphones I love the color and they are soft on the ears, the sound is great from them."
46,"These are very comfortable,noise is really blocked and I love the color.would definitely buy again"
47,"My daughter likes it very much, the quality is very good, the sound quality is very clear."
48,These are amazing! We give them to the kids for their tablets and they're wonderful. Great sound and so comfy to wear.
49,Seems to be holding up very well. Bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves the color. Perfect size for laptop use.
50,"Love the color, and the weight is light,fit well,can be adjusted,provide amazing sound . Worth the price, will buy it again if needed!"
51,My daughter used it she said she love it and she said it works perfectly!
52,I got this for my daughter to watch her tablet quietly and they are amazing.
53,Bought these for my daughter. The sound quality is very nice and I like that they fold up for storage. She uses them all the time. The sound quality maters a lot because she wears hearing aids and they are prefect for that. They fit over her ears nicely.
54,Love these headphones. Sound good and comfortable.
55,"Bought this earphones for my niece as birthday gift..she love it, she love the color, and sound quality was Great!"

87,Worked fine
88,"Great headphones for the price! Good quality, would reccommend"
89,"PRO:
Good construction. Color is bright and pretty.
Deep bass. Not an audiophile headphone but not bad considering the price.
Light, not heavy like Beats.
Covers the ears to block out outside noise.
Does not put too much pressure on the ears and head like Beats.
Braided cord is a nice touch.

CON:
A little small for my head. The Beats headphones can be stretched longer to fit me.
No microphone for smartphones."
90,This headphone is so nice! I bought this for myself to listen to music. The color of this headphone is so beautiful! It's a great gift for friends.
91,good sound quality
92,Fast delivery and really cute headphones.
93,Cord got a short in it the first month we got these. Only one side of the headphones works sometimes.
94,We’ve only had them for 3 months and they’ve already failed 😕
95,Wonderful. These were perfect for my mother. Would by again.
96,Info given states that this will work with I-phones. The part that plugs in is not compatible with my I-phone. Seller not accurate in decription.
97,"First of all, the sound is great! They look awesome and feel good on your ears. Their great!"
98,Bought them for my daughter- they are perfect with good sound quality. Comfy to wear and fits both kids and adults
99,Sound is great! I use these with a splitter & converter with my IPhone 7. Love it!

101,This is a really nice pair of headphones that are working well for me. Pretty good sounds.
102,"They work well and the color is great. I can still kinda hear what's going on around me, which I don't mind:)"
103,"Great headphones, very comfortable, quality sound and noise cancellation. Highly recommended for the price."
104,"After a little over 1 month, the ear phones are broken. I would hope that they would have lasted longer."

106,My son loves them
107,"The headpones look very nice and the sound is also good, I like it very much😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗"
108,Looks really nice and expensive. Doesnt feel nice and expensive. Sounds very clear and goes pretty loud.
109,Bought them for my daughter and she loves them
110,My 11 yr old loves them and uses them all the time. Both at home and at school.
111,I love it.
112,Works great
113,K
114,Great for my daughter
115,My grandaughter loves these
116,No real bass. Sound quality is meh. Skull Candy headphones are a lot better.
117,I was looking for a cheap headphones for my laptop and the color of this headphones caught my attention. It looks like a beats hp. The sound quality is decent. But don’t expect that it will be the same as the expensive ones. The only thing that lacks is the attachment cuz i cannot connect this to my cellphone. All in all for the price it’s a great buy.
118,"The headphone is really nice and beautiful, i like the color and the song I heard is very clear. The headphone is also very comfort and just suit my ears. Like it and strong recommend."
119,"I really like these headphones. The headphones sounds really great, and are comfortable to wear. I do have a iPhone and using the adapter doesn’t minimize the music."
120,good
121,I would recommend this for a child because the ear padding isn’t that soft for an adult. Gave to my niece.
122,"I wanted a pair of over the ear headphones because ear buds tend to irritate my ears. I didn’t have a lot to spend so I thought I would try these after seeing their reviews. Well as they say, you get what you pay for. They fit fine and I like the color options but the sound quality is awful. It’s very muffled and difficult hearing dialog or the words in music. Very garbled sounding. I wish I could write a better review but I just can’t. I’m passing these on to my friends little girl. She will like the color and not care about sound quality."
123," My 12 year old needed headphones for school and chose these mainly cause of the color options. They are not bass headphones nor the best for music. For all around headphones, they are great. They are comfortable and great to wear for long periods"
124,"I purchased these headphones to have a spare set and because I love purple. They are just as beautiful as pictured. They also work very well. I like the soft padded earpieces. I like that they are foldable and can easily be packed in a suitcase to take with you. I still prefer a wire-free set but these come in handy when you can't be wireless. They sound great too.

125,"Love these headphones! They cover your whole ear, helping to blockout other sounds! I love that they fold up super small! I’ve been letting my 8yr old use them in the car, and they fit perfectly in his small activity bag! Nice solid color!"
126,"These headphones are the most aesthetically pleasing budget pair I've ever owned. The headphones are lightweight and have comfortable padding. The best detail is the braided wire because it prevents tangling and provides a more durable usage over time. Just be aware that the sound quality is so-so, when in a call, the other person can not hear me well, and it might feel uncomfortable after using it for a long time. It is a good budget pair for an everyday usage. Overall, I can't complain because of the price."
127,"Basic headphones, I got them for my 6 year old because he needs them for school. Nothing fancy with these, you get good sound and they're pretty comfortable to wear. They fit his head which is a plus for me, and don't tangle."
128,"good material and it is hard to break it because it is flexible, and it is not hurting my ear at all when i using it, even i was putting on to listen music for 2 hours, it was really comfortable with a good sound quality."
129,These are cool looking headphones with great sound and very comfortable even when leaning on the earpiece. I am not giving them 5 stars because their earpiece position does not adjust but they are still a great product and value.
130,"Love love love love these! So cute! And the wire is lace like which makes it very comfortable. Now I wish it had a microphone, but I knew it didn't so definitely a five star purchase."
131,I had these for about a week. I got them for my niece but ended up using them these work with my laptop its a HP and they sound clear and fit nice. No complaints here.
132,I bought these for a gift but I seriously am keeping them for myself. They block outside noise while delivering perfect sound quality. I am able to watch my shows on my phone in peace!
133,"Works great, looks great, and is very comfortable on the ear (even after a couple of hours). They also fold in when putting them away, which I like. Overall I am very happy."
134,This is what I expected from reading the product description and we are happy with this purchase. It works well for our young daughter.
135,The headphones are cute but music only plays out of one eat and it has trouble connecting to my computer
136,Only left side of headphones work. Returning headphones
137,Poor Quailty
138,Reasonably priced for the quality you get. Mostly for casual listeners. Nice present for young nieces and nephews. Color and finish is actually very elegant.
139,"I use them to work out with. Speakers sounds great and clear, helps me drown out everything around me. I love this color."
140,"I love these. I was worried they were gonna be cheap because I'd never heard ood the brand and they were pretty inexpensive. But the sound quality is great, cord is long enough to have my phone away from me, they fold up to an easy travel size, and I love the colors."
141,Super cute for my toddler Great sound fast ship sturdy love the color still in one piece after a few months of toddler use
142,"These work great. They are simple and of good quality. No surprises and no complaints, I would recommend them."
143,The price is a steal for these amazing headphones! The sound quality is top-notch. I love how light weight they are and how easily they fold. They are perfect for traveling and throwing in my bag.
144,"I needed a pair of headphones to use every morning while playing games, watching youtube, and editing videos. These work very well and have been good for every day use. I find that they are very sturdy and feel like a much more expensive pair. I really like the way the cord is encased with the reinforcing covering. They have worked with our desktop, my cellphone, and our iPad very well. They fold up and I am able to store them away (hide them from my kids) easily."
145,"these are great, just like pictured. sound quality is good."
146,"Bought these for my niece, sound is good and looks similar to Beats by Dre which is cool. It is hard wired, wish it was bluetooth but for the price is not bad headphone"
147,Got those for my daughter (11) and she loves them. No complaints.
148,These headphones work great & my son likes them a lot.
149,We love these headphones! They are very well put together and are very comfy! My teen daughter loved the color and she confiscated my pair within hours of their arrival. The headphones offer great sound quality and have given us NO issues! We highly recommend!
150,Awesome for the money!
151,Feel the quality is good.
