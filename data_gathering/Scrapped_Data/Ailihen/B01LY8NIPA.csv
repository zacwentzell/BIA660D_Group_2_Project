,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop Tablet Android Smartphones(Grey)
0,"Durable and good sound. I use them in my car for the children's DVD players. Not a single complaint about fit or sound from the 4, 6, or 11 year old."
1,"I don't take the time very often to write a review. I purchased these headphones for my 82 year old dad for Christmas. He needed a pair of headphones to listen to the TV while running on a treadmill. I saw in other reviews that these headphones block out noise that is around you. Even though my dad is a young 82 year old, his hearing is that of a person his age. He loves these headphones and said they really do cut out the noise of the treadmill so he can hear the TV. I am very happy with this purchase!"
2,Bought these headphones for 11 year old. He loves them and they seem to work well. They are compatible with his Kindle.
3,"This was a gift for my daughter, and they work and look great! The black box they come in make them look a lot more expensive than they are. They work with the Xbox 1 controller too!"
4,We are happy with these. Sound is good and an affordable price. They extend so if your head is a little bigger they fit well. Me and my husband both use them on our desktop and laptop computer.
5,"I ordered 2 sets. Golden set for me and the black red for my wife . I was very pleasantly surprised. The are well made. The head band is a kind of special material. The padding that sits on the ears is made of a soft vinyl and nicely padded. The earpieces fold in so they are easy to carry with you. The auxillary wire that connects it to your device is wrapped so it doesn't get tangled. It is plenty long enough that when you move around, it doesn't pull the earphones off.The unit itself is lightweight and comfortable.
As for the sound quality, it is excellent. I was so surprised. The base is good, but not too much. The sound is crisp and clear. The headphones cancel out background noise pretty well. I had bought my daughter the other brand headphones, which are over £70. Yes, the sound quality is better with them. BUT, not so much better that they are worth the extra money. These are so well worth the money."
6,"I have owned multiple headphones before and this one is the best I have ever gotten. The sound, clarity, and bass is absolutely good and unlike the other headphones I owned this one doesn't hurt my ears."
7,"The packaging was nice and was folded into a plastic mold. A plus for the folding! The cups on the headphones are somewhat comfortable and so is the band. The cable that is used to plug into devices is wrapped making it stronger. The sound is not really that crisp but the bass is pretty good. Lastly, the microphone is decent and can pick up sounds of you talking without the mic being held up to the mouth. All in all, it's great!"
8,"The only thing I would’ve have wanted more from this headphone is the ability to use the mic for pc as well, which unfortunately you can’t. Sound is really good and you can hear the quality of the speakers. Comfortable to wear and stretchable with soft ear paddings. The body is made from plastic which I really don’t mind since it is durable and the cable is nylon braided which is a plus. Also, the earpads are foldable so you can carry it with you easily."
9,"I have a pair of very comfortable blu tooth headphones, but, as with all blu tooth headphones, they occasionally pop in and out. And, frankly, sometimes I just want to plug in and start listening to music without connecting, etc. I'd had a pair of Philips corded headphones with reasonable sound (I'm not an audiophile) that just wore out. So, I went to Amazon to find a replacement. I'm so glad I found these -- they're perfect! Compact (they fold), reasonably priced, and best of all, the sound is great!!"
10,"Headphones were actually very comfortable, even more comfortable than a MUCH more expensive pair of headphones i owned, and i can wear the AILIHEN headphones longer than i could the expensive pair.

Cancels noise pretty well, almost completely. I can skateboard and not hear the wheels clacking over the sidewalk.

Headphone quality was WAY better than the price leads you to believe, it was almost as good, (like 99% as good) as the WAY MORE EXPENSIVE PAIR i bought.

I've only had them a week or so, so i dont know how long they'll last. I'll update you if/when they break. NOTe: Expensive pair broke six months in.

Overall: Great Headphones, look nice, sound nice, feel nice. The red and black were my favorite color, went with gold though, check all colors before you make your decision."
11,"Overall, this is a cheaper version of those expensive ""Beats by Dre"" headsets, and it is modeled to look like them. Speaking as a consumer, and as a father, I'd rather not pay $100+ for a brand name, and so I am glad to go with this option rather than the more expensive brand with identical performance.

Apart from the looks, the only thing wrong with these headphones is the length of the cord. A slightly longer cord, with some sort of soft plastic bracket to limit the length or draw the cord into a bunch, would really have gone a long way toward hitting the 5-star goal.

Sound quality is the same as any non-HD high quality headset. There are not really any noise-cancellation features, other than some padding along the ears, so take that as you will.

All-in-all, great headphones for the cost."
12,"When I first read other people reviews I said to myself what? I have expensive headphones people describing this with a great sound and very comfortable. Still I was skeptic but something in the back of my head said to me it is only 20.00 dollars if they do not meet your expectation send them back or just toss them.
I got them first impression counts a lot the package was really neat. When I used them for the first time I was very surprised by the sound. To make a long story short I took it for my workout I have to say I loved the sound I am really impressed, what the heck I paid so much for other headphones that does not have nearly a bass sound, I am very picky when it comes to headphones I need to feel I listening to music in crystal clear way. These phones delivers that, my son who is a DJ could not believe it so I guess I will be buying a second set for him."
13,"Nice headphones!! Feel good on my head and my ears, the fit is perfect for me and they sound great. I'm an older person and love that I can finally hear all the sounds in the music again! Beautiful highs, midtones and nice deep base! Pretty good at noise cancelling too, sometimes I don't really want that feature though. There are times when I want to be able to hear the outside world, for safety. But I'll just use another pair for those times. I also love that they fold up so it's easy to tuck them away in a pocket. Another thing I especially like is the braided cord...that was a wonderful idea!!! I took one star off because they won't go up as loud as I normally like, but that's just me. ( I put the 5th star back on because since they won't go as loud as this old hippy would like, that means I won't need another set of headphones without noise cancellation after all! ) This is obviously a good thing!"
14,"This review needs to be split into two sections. First there is the quality of the sound and the base which is actually amazing. The ear pads cover the ears completely and do help to eliminate some exterior noise. As far as the performance with the Audio I was very pleased, however about two days after the eligible date for returning the item past. The cord broke at the microphone. Decor you slipped out of the microphone and Winston pulled and now the earphones are completely useless in complete and total waste of money"
15,"I loved these at first. They had great sound and they were comfortable to wear. But less than six months and they fall apart on me. I was careful folding them, but that didn't matter. A piece on one side fell off, the cord is hanging out, and I can no longer wear them. Which sucks because they still sound good."
16,"I bought this for my daughter. As soon as it showed up, I tested it before giving it to my daughter. In just a few minutes of testing it, the cable came apart and the connector appeared to be broken. This one only worked for 2 minutes. Pure junk! I have many other headphones and have never seen such poor quality. It was not worth my time to send it back or to deal with getting a refund. It actually ended up in the trash can before I recycled the box that it came in."
17,"Bought on January 5, 2017, They sounded great and I liked them at first but after about 5 months the sound out of the left side of the headphones comes and goes sporadically. I have used them with normal use about 3-4 days a week at work and lock them up when I off. Now I gotta find a new pair of headphones which sucks cuss I liked the sound this one had."
18,"My daughter needed new headphones, or rather I needed her to wear headphones so I don't have to listen to her YouTube shows. The headphones are comfortable to wear because they are cushioned which also give a noise cancelling effect. The sound quality is good. The headphones fit my adult head as well as my 3.5 year old's head."
19,"I've been using these for a few months, now, and I love them! The sound is good, the stereo is excellent: it's amazing to hear Left and Right sound, as well as moving sound, while listening to favorite music.
I admit that I am not an audiophile, so perhaps my evaluation isn't meaningful to those of you who are audiophiles, but to the rest of the population: these are excellent, the price is very affordable, and they are comfortable, easily adjusted for different sized heads, even foldable to a degree for easier storage. I highly recommend them!"
20,I wished I knew about this headphones before. They are quite comfortable to wear and carry . Cell phone conversations are head clearly and the noise cancellation feature helps out a lot. These are not Boss quality but a really good buy for the price! I listen to podcast and music with good clarity. I am very happy with this purchase.
21,"Bought these for my son last Christmas. He loved them and used them all year. Said they sound great. I listened to them and they sound pretty good. I think as far as sound quality they are a steal. Unfortunately about a month ago one side went out and a couple weeks later the other side started acting up & only works part of the time. My son was really bummed.

This son takes care of his things very well. Better than me quite frankly. If he was rough with his stuff I wouldn’t take a star at all but since he treated them like his baby I’d hope they would last a couple years let alone less than one. Still, I’d say it’s a good deal. I’d give 3.5 if I could.

If I hear from someone who thinks get xan/should make it right I’ll update this review."
22,"Poor quality connectors- BEWARE. I puchased this headphone and the i35 in May. 2 weeks after purchased, the tip of this headphone connector came off in my kindle. I assumed my one son must have been rough with it and threw the headphones away and took the loss. One month later in July while travelling, the tip of the i35 connector also came off in my other son's ipad. This son is older and has never had this problem with headphones. Although both are comfortable, be very careful as I now have to take both digital devices to a repair shop to get the tips out and must now order 2 more headphones. BUYER BEWARE."
23,These are very good quality headphones. I bought two for us to use on a trip. For the low price I was surprised at how well they are constructed. They fold up nicely to put in my carry-on bag. They are also very comfortable to wear with just the right amount of pressure on the ears. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for good ones for movies or music.
24,"Right ear quit working after 2 months, with light use. Doesn't mean they will all be like that, but this was my experience. Didn't want to bother with returning, so I just bought another brand."
25,"For the $, it's a good deal. Took a chance thinking these might be better than my earbuds for talking on the phone. Found them to be obtrusive, not comfortable and my ears warmed up fairly quickly (and it's January). They are probably better for listening to music while mowing the lawn. Not so for talking on the phone."
26,"I really liked these headphones initially. The sound is good, they're comfy and I like that they are collapsible. But unfortunately, a few weeks after I got them they started malfunctioning. They randomly activate Siri or pause something I'm watching or randomly start music. Occasionally it's because I've accidentally pressed the remote button, but more often it's just a random occurrence. As you can imagine it gets pretty irritating. I haven't used the microphone and I'd be afraid they'd randomly hang up on someone I might be speaking with."
27,"What a piece of garbage, worked for about a week than sound started crackling one side would work and go out than the other side, had to constantly turn or reinsert plug... Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product!!!"
28,These were a Christmas gift for my son for gaming . So far he loves them and is very impressed with the quality and the sound ! they came very quickly and the packaging was excellent ! My son and I are both very impressed with the high quality and attention to detail . They appear to be made to last for a long time. I would recommend purchasing these . Update .. I'm sad to say that after 3 months use one speaker has already quit working . My son is very careful with these and can't understand how they could malfunction so quickly. Very disappointing as he loved them. Now it's too late to return through Amazon so I'm hoping I can contact the manufacturer for a replacement . This is the 2nd pair we have purchased . The first ones lasted 6 months but it was too late to ask for a replacement . If I can't get a replacement this time then I will find a different brand for next purchase.
29,"Don't panic when you first open them! They make a horrid cracking noise when unfolding! If you're like me, you'll panic and think you broke them but for the price they aren't bad! I bought these as a gift for someone going on a long plane ride who otherwise never wears headphones so they're great for that purpose. I did try them on when they arrived though and while I'm not sure I would want to wear them regularly for long periods (I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to headphones so take that with a grain of salt!) they are definitely great if you don't wear them often enough to justify spending the big bucks!"
30,"Impressed with the quality of these headphones for the price. We have bought several off brand options before and were disappointed with the fit and comfort, however these are very comfortable both around the ears and over your head. The foldable feature is also really nice. The only reason that I'm rating these 4 instead of 5 stars is that the sound quality is not quite as great as we had hoped and you can definitely hear what someone is listening to when they have them on. I still think they were wonderfully priced on sale for the quality we got and would recommend to anyone that isn't looking to spend a fortune on some comfortable, portable headphones, just don't expect them to be 'noise canceling'."
31,"I got this head phone for my 10 years old girl for her bday, she didn't use this for two weeks, one side just completely stop working, I'm gonna try to return this product, spend a little more get a better one."
32,"Great headphones for the price! My only complaint about the design of the headphone itself is that my ears tend to get sore from the pads.

My first set unfortunately ended up breaking (a piece inside must have come loose in one of the phones so whenever I turned my head I would hear a harsh rattling sound from that piece moving inside). I contacted Ailihen. They were extremely helpful. They sent me another headphone free of charge without any issue and the replacement came within a few days. I would definitely consider purchasing other products from them in the future."
33,"These headphones have low volume, weak bass and after only a few weeks of use, the plug end is malfunctioning. Has to be wiggled to get full sound. These headphones are cheap and now i have to throw them away."
34,These are great headphones! These are my third pair (my husband lost the first two) and I haven't ever had a problem with them. They can even withstand my toddler getting a hold of them!
35,My 8 year old son needed a new set of headphones for school as you have to provide your own. I tried them myself and the sound is very good. The headphones are very comfortable; they swivel to fit your ear and lengthen to fit your head properly. It is a stylish design and the blue is very vibrant.
36,"Sound quality is great for a non-audiophile. Good bass and soundproofing.

After a couple hours though they seem to hurt the sides of my ears from pressing on them. Not sure if it's the shape of my ears or size of my head but I need to take a break every few hours."
37,"I don't know much about headphones but the sound quality is great. The fact that it folds into itself is really nice for storage or bringing it around. The cord is sturdy and feels like it won't brake. I have not tried out the microphone but I am sure that it will be great like the rest of the product. The only issue I had is that after about 30 min of wearing them, my ears hurt from the pressure. They are a bit too small."
38,"The bass is great and the noise isolation seems to work pretty well. They are also very comfortable. Like any pair of headphones I have ever had I need to take them off after like 2 hours or so because it starts to get a little irritating having something in or on your ears that long, but compared to others these are pretty comfortable for an extended period of time.

By the way I saw a comment posted which said that you can't skip to the next song with these headphones, but actually you can. You just have to hit the answer button twice, just make sure you do so fast enough. If you do it too slow it just pauses the song then plays it."
39,"I got these on sale, so I can't be too disappointed. They are ok. My problem with them is the right headphone doesn't play as loudly as the left. If any pressure is applied to the right headphone it creates a loud crackling noise in your ear, which sometimes makes the sound come out better... weird and loud, but it works sometimes. Other than that, they are comfortable. You get what you pay for I suppose. Definitely would not buy these for someone else or recommend them."
40,"Holy Moly... I got two of these and they are fantastic.... the sound is good and clear, and it really does block other noises out... I had purchased a cheap model at a retailer and then saw these... the others we keep in the car to use when traveling, but these end up in the car too! don't get just one... get two for that purpose alone, leave one in the car. Helps when I'm online working and the TV is on in the next room... I don't hear it. Great product... may buy a couple more just to have on hand"
41,"This thing is great so far. It's lightweight, sound quality is superb for the price. Earphones are very comfortable as is the adjustable headband. The microphone works, too. It is superior in most respects to the $100 headphones I bought, which has a defective microphone. The only reason for the four stars? Durability is a question mark. The lightweight and low price suggests to me that it's potentially an issue. Yet I did drop it a couple of times on carpet and it seems to be just fine."
42,"This was a gift, but the person receiving these headphones was very pleased. Note that the box said for Iphone, Ipad, etc., but the description when ordering said all smartphones and laptops. Luckily the description was right because the recipient does not have the Iphone but another smartphone and the headphones did indeed work."
43,"For the first few months, audio was perfect and crystal clear. Honestly, these were one of my best headphone purchases I ever made. Sadly, a few weeks ago, audio can no longer be heard from the right side of the headphones, unless I tilt my head in an uncomfortable way and the wires decide to work. I’ve tried to figure out what is happening, but I have no idea and can’t fix them"
44,"Update: The customer service has been great and they got back to me really quickly. The replacement headset works great and I have not had nay issues with it so far.

Update: I have had these headphones for a little over 2 months and the mic no longer works on this. I don't extensively use these headphones so I'm not sure why the mic would just go out. I guess you get what you paid for.

March review:
I have had these headphones for a week now. The sound on it is very good for headphones less than $20. The muffs on them are very comfortable. The mic on it is also very good."
45,"The problem with these headphones is that they are designed for iphones and ipods. They absolutely did not work with my Moto x and the sound quality on my dell laptop was not great, I had to tune the audio settings to strike the right balance. When I plugged it into my docking station I had to change my audio settings again. I did not have to change anything with other headphones. They seemed to work fine with my wife's iphone and when they did work the sound isolation was good. That's the only good thing about these."
46,"Folks a cpl months after i have had this item, it is malfunctioning. What it does is activated ur phones voice setting which interrupts the music or vid u r listening too. It happens so often that i have to take it out. If it's not the voice activation, it sends the volume up and down over and over. I'm not sure if it's the 3.5mm jack or something else..but that's what's happening. Check out other brands, this one gives trouble."
47,"I use these as gaming headphones for my Xbox One and they sound amazing! I mostly use them for talking with friends and playing sports games, but I'm sure they would be great for those who play shooter games casually. The lows and mids sound great for music and I would definitely recommend them for those looking to find an inexpensive headphone option."
48,"These headphones were ordered so my hubby could watch his news programs while I watched another TV program, both of us in the same room sitting next to each other. They keep the noise out for him and I can't hear his program. They are very comfortable and we are both pleased."
49,"It sounded pretty good, blocking most of the outside noise, unlike most headphones I used. Yet, after having it for 30 days, the cord was damaged, and now there is no noise on my right side. I still use it around the house, but I'll have to fix it or purchase another in the future."
50,"worst headset ever , very poor quality , it stopped working after a couple of month noting that it was rarely even used"
51,"These are really great headphones! The sound quality is fantastic and the design is smooth and VERY comfortable. I had originally bought a pair for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas. However, after seeing them and testing the design, music quality, etc. etc, I literally bought a pair for almost everyone on my list. I'm even planning on getting myself some after the holidays!! I can't wait!!"
52,Item sounded good and microphone picked up background noise. Product stopped working 2 days after return window. I bought it on March 19th and the cord shorted out on April 20th while walking through the supermarket. I used the headset almost daily with the phone in my pocket. I assume that is why the cord stopped working.
53,Happy with headphones. Sound is good. I will vouch for that because my son couldn't hear me when I was talking to him;) only complaint is the ear part is definatly on the small size.
54,"Great product for the price. Very nice sound quality. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. If you are looking for something inexpensive with good sound quality, these are a nice option. Purchased for my son to plug into DVD players in the car. He loves them, and has no complaints."
55,"I have a friend at work that have the small Bose, so we compare them to these headsets and they more than held their own but the Bose are Bose with a little more bass and soft ear pads with glasses."
56,My son got these for Christmas last year and they barely lasted 3 months! Very disappointing!
57,Great headphones for my kids to use in school. The sound seems decent especially for the price. I like that these don't feel flimsy and would think they should last the school year. They fold up nice and fit nice for kids and adults.
58,"The headphones are amazing. They are comfortable, they bump and thump LOUD. The sound is crisp and clear and the noise cancellation is amazing. Also the color is even better and more vibrant than in the picture. My roommate has beats and he is a little jealous of how I got these for only 17$ which was a steal. Would highly recommend to anyone looking fro a pair of good headphones"
59,"Bought these for my son two months ago and the only time he used them was for 30 mins before bed with his ipad. Well, now there is only sound coming out of one ear. Hope to be able to return it and get my money back."
60,I've had these headphones for less than two months and they've already broken. I don't know why people bother making junk like this. What a waste of $20.
61,"Impressive bass response. Great price for comfortable headphones. Only thing missing was a operations manual to explain the inline switch for pause, play, etc. Found information online for a unit similar in design."
62,"These headphones are some of the best I have ever owned! I needed something for running and decided on these because they were cheap costing. I made a great decision! The sound is fantastic and they look great too! My friends compliment how cool my headphones look and have asked me where they can get some of the same kind. If you are on the fence about getting these, do it, it will be one of the best decisions you ever made!"
63,"Bought this as a gift for our daughter at Christmas, within 3 weeks the outer casing to the connector cracked and the metal connector fell out."
64,"These are really nice headphones that I use with my Roland keyboard. They have a strong, clear bass and mid and high ranges are also good. They fit comfortably and have a noise cancelling effect, even if they are not advertised that way. I could not be more pleased."
65,to be honest i never heared if this brand before. just got it 2 days ago. i like the headphones. very solid. the sound is great ( i use it daily). headphones could be folded and length could be adjusted on both sides. the microphone works great. well packaged - could be a good gift. i hope it will last for a long time :)
66,"As I said they are okay. They work, my grndson can use them but they are nothing like pictured. I would have returned them but they were a Christmas present and he used them immediately. Since they worked, I left it alone but I wasn't happy it wasn't as I ordered."
67,"Purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them. I tried them out myself and the sound is clear and the bass...beautiful!! I was hesitant because I'm not familiar with this brand. But, the reviews are good so I gave them shot. So far, so good."
68,"Great sound quality, they just kind of hurt my ears after a little while of wearing them. I didn't want to pay the shipping back so I will just give my ears a break now and then. Also works well with my Xbox one and can use as a mic."
69,Broke within a week. Returned.
70,"They are Ok, not very expensive so they will do. I bought them to use on my cell phone for conversations but they sound very tinny and it can be difficult to hear at times so I would not recommend them for this purpose. I tried them listening to music and they work well enough, I am not a big music critic and would not feel right spending big dollars for a headset so I am happy with them for this purpose. The folding option was appealing but even folded they take up a good deal of space so I don't think this is much of a benefit."
71,Horrible I try on 3 different devices all bad sound and you can't plug it all the in or sound only comes out of one side
72,"For the price, WOW ! Sound is great, I play it with my I-pod,and the sound is great, and if you like bass, well it has it, I'm a DJ and I really like these for the price, and good block out noise. Good job on these, Ailihen !"
73,Excellent head phones. My wife got these for using around the house. She said they do a great job of blocking out ambient sound and delivers a great sound for the music and games she plays. She even uses them to mow the yard.
74,We bought a pair of these and within less than two weeks the port/sound started going out. After some email discussion the seller replaced the headphones which also stopped working within a week the second pair. Didn't even bother asking for another pair bought skull candy instead
75,"These are the best headphones! Great sound and fits into all my devices.
The least thing I liked was getting it out of the box, What a terrific product!!!!!"
76,"Package came when promised. These headphones are for our 12 year- old grandson who lives in another state. From what his mother says, he loves them! He uses them with his iPhone 5C.. plugs them I,. listening to music. He said they are great!"
77,"It is seriously amazing! The sound and ass go so loud unlike my last pair of headphones, so this is definitely an improvement! And I love the mic so I don't have to take out my phone to answer, especially when it's cold. After a while it does feel a little bit pressure with my ears but I honestly just remove them and then put them back on my ear and the problem's solved. All in all, I would definitely recommend this product!"
78,"These headphones which I bought for my 11 year old son were a disappointment. They very quickly stopped working properly, he initially was not able to hear voices and they suddenly failed to work at all with the computer and eventually not with his Kindle either. At this time the cord also broke where it would be plugged in to a device. Overall a waste of money, luckily the price had been significantly reduced!"
79,"This headset is comfortable to wear. It looks neat.
The quality is not any less than the other Logitech headsets I've bought before
and the price is about half of those or less.
It is also great that you can fold it."
80,"Tight on the ears. I had too get used to them. About 4 months in the microphone began to be spotty and low volume, now 5 months in the right speaker is completely dead.."
81,"Seem sturdily made. Not real comfortable to wear, especially since it does not have any form of genuine padding where it sits on the top of the wearer head. Sound is a little tinney. However, the price was right."
82,"Bought these to replace a very expensive pair that got broken. I should have bought these to begin with. Good quality, they look really nice and my son likes them better than the $65 one he had."
83,These are great earphones for the price. I bought these to replace a pricier pair ($60+) that my kids broke and thought I might buy ones that were less expensive and easier to replace if broken again (LOL). I have been very pleased this these. The noise canceling is excellent and the sound clarity is very good. They are better than my previous pair that I spent 4x the money on. Excellent purchase for $
84,"The look and quality of product is really good. As far as sound quality goes the bass isn't really all that great. I guess that's expected for the price. But it's great to watch videos, movies, etc. I just gave mine to my son who uses on his phone for YouTube."
85,"I normally use it for conference calls and it works great. Superior sound quality. Easy folding option. The microphone has very good quality, and I use it to record some of my music. Been using it for five months and still works very well. Highly recommended."
86,I can't say I'm a fan of the ear cushions on the earphones. I feel like my head is overheating when I wear them.
87,"These headphones are so incredibly handy. I live in New York city and wish I could cancel out all of the noise when I walk around. These headphones do that, but also allow me to listen to music and talk on the phone without having to take the phone out of my pocket. Amazing."
88,"These are really great for the price. The only downside is that you have to have them in a ""sweet spot"" for maximum quality. But I suppose other headphones that don't completely cover your ears have the same fault."
89,I love them so much. Anyone who doesn't try them is a fool. The sound is beautiful & crystal clear. They are super comfortable. Don't be a fool with your 💰 try them. :) :):)
90,"Great headset, It fits perfectly and has great sound. I mostly use it for my cell phone, but may use it for other listening. Would recommend it to anyone."
91,"They're just OK. Ear part is kind of small, really made more for kids than adults. OK sound quality. They're not dissapointing for the <$20 price. Not many cheaper over-ear headphones available that work with phone calls, most gaming sets have a mic but it doesn't work for phone calls."
92,I bought these headphones for my 7 year old daughter and was very impressed. Very good headphones at a great price. Sound quality is great and so is the feel. I have Beats headphones wireless studio edition and while this doesn't sound as good as those they come pretty close and are 90% cheaper so don't hesitate if you want good headphones for a great price
93,"Got it for my son who plays Overwatch online. He's very happy with it.
The fidelity is fine for speech, no better than you'd expect for the price.
ear muffs might be too small if you have big ears."
94,"These headphones sound great, the cord doesn't tangle, and storage is easy, which makes it very easy to grab and go when I go to the gym with them. Also, they are very comfortable. No complaints here."
95,"For the price, these are great. I wish the mute button didn't require me to hold it and I can't hear myself talk as the mike doesn't send my voice to headset - but that is live-able. Otherwise, totally satisfied"
96,"I actually bought this so I could use it with my iPhone, thinking it would have the type of connection that fits my iPhone. It does not, although I can use it with my iPad. I am disappointed that I cannot use it with my iPhone. Had I known that I would not have bought it."
97, These have great sound. They adjust so they can be used by anyone. I use them for watching movies and listening to music on my laptop.
98,"Best Head Phones I have Heard, use them on my Kindle Fire HDX to listen to Great MUSIC. Very Crispy Sound, Great Bass."
99,Worked just fine for my daughter until today when she disconnected them from her iPad and the tip of the plug pulled free from the cord and is now lodged inside her (school owned) iPad. I will stick with a name brand product going forward rather than take my chances on these again. I'll update this review if the seller is willing to replace but no money will be spent on this brand again.
100,I purchased this for my husband to use while he is on dialysis and he loves it! Says the quality of sound is great. Now he sits at the computer with it too.
101,Items came broken
102,"For price, these are awesome. I bought 1 pair and ended up buying 2 more!"
103,"My experience with these are amazing. I tested these headphones with and handful of songs, and audio tests. They aren't lying when they say these are good quality headphones, with good bass. I also should mention how I got them replaced when they broke. All I had to do was email support and give them my order number, and they got it delivered. The person I talked to was also very kind. If your looking for affordable, great for their price headphones, these are it."
104,"Very impressed by these headphones. They are inexpensive, yet for the price sound really good. Great overall sound including pretty good base and excellent mids and highs. They are fairly comfortable and lightweight. I'm not sure the materials would hold up to workouts or other activity like that, but for normal everyday use it should last a long time. These are an excellent sounding choice for headphones if you don't want to spend of lot of money."
105,"I was really happy with these earphones until this week. All of a sudden they are causing Spotify to skip songs, prompting Siri, and disconnecting phone calls. I would understand if I had been hard on them, but I only use these at my desk."
106,"I am very impressed with the quality of sound that these AILIHEN I60 headphones produce. They are comparable to the more expensive ones. They provide a clear and natural sound. The headband is adjustable, and are foldable for maximum portability. The cord is sturdy looking. They are light weight and have very comfortable ear pads for many hours of use. I like that they block external noise effectively. There is a built-in microphone for hands-free phone calling and it picks up my voice without me talking directly into it. I am really happy with the purchase of these headphones."
107,My husband really likes these head phones but a wire broke in the first one we purchased only months after purchasing it so we ordered a second set and are hoping for better results.
108,These are very comfortable and allow me to be in my own musical haven. I use them in a very noisy workplace.
109,"These headphones truly sound great for under twenty bucks the highs are high and crisp the mids are right there in the bass is fantastic.
For te money.. These sound great for sure"
110,"I am a third grade elementary school teacher. One of my students needed to purchase a headset, so I helped him buy one. The choice was 100% his. He looked on the internet for two days until he finally chose his ""Gold Ailihen."" He thought it was the coolest one out there! I also explained to him that considering the quality, price, and technology he made a great choice."
111,"Robust sound for very reasonable price, good quality, fast delivery, will buy again!"
112,My 11 year old loves these. Only thing I can think of to make the experience better is having them be wireless. But we bought them as is! Still awesome!
113,I just got them an they are a Christmas present for my grandson so I really don't know how they will work. but will let you know little later.. thank you
114,For the price this is a very good set of headphones. The pair I purchased for my grandson has survived months of use and has outlasted similar other brands.
115,"I've had my AILIHEN I60 headphones for almost 2 weeks now and WOW!!! I'm blown away by the performance of them, the bass is great, sound is crystal, noise cancelation stupendous. I put these to a test by playing music from YouTube, my phones music, and a game all at the same time... I could hear everything so clear it's as if I was listening to each one separately. I give a 5 star and would buy another pair if needed."
116,Wire shorted in the microphones after 6 weeks. Sad because it was a gift to my boyfriend to use while he's deployed overseas in the air force.
117,"These are fine in terms of sound quality, but they seem to be sized for people with small heads. Even extended to their full length, they barely reach to the bottom of my ears. I have had plenty of other ""overhead"" headphones in the past and not had this issue."
118,"I love these headphones, I really do. My only problem is mine broke about 3 months after I got them. Music wouldn't play correctly and it fully depended on the angle of the cord. Up until this happened they were great -which is why I ended up buying another pair because I love the sound quality and mic on them. If this pair breaks again anytime soon, I'm just done with it."
119,"The headphones serve the purpose I needed.
They are light weight, decent sound and inexpensive."
120,"smooth transaction, quick shipping, awesome headphones, they are just what I needed!"
121,"I was a bit skeptical of these headphones, but they exceeded my expectations. They're really comfortable and the sound is excellent. They're cheap for great quality headphones. It came in with the original box and was well protected when shipped. Highly recommended for anyone!"
122,"Although this product is really comfortable even when you wear glasses, do not buy if you think you are going to be constantly moving/bending
the wire(walking). Wire broke within 2 months Not for active people. Im switching to wireless headphones."
123,"I was really excited to purchase these headphones (a big step up in quality from my normal headphones).

Unfortunately, the sound went out in less than a month. Going back to $15 Sony headphones."
124,I have had it for such a short time and already the left earphone has stopped working. No sound will come out. Disappointing.
125,LOVE THESE.. granted they are big like the old school ones but they are VERY comfortable and I personally had problems with the earbud type because they always fell out of one ear and I also did like the fact that you could hear the background noise.. My husband was behind me talking and the yelled and I STILL didnt hear him ( hey reason enough to buy them).. and the mic works great as well
126,It's not comfortable at all.. for small heads only.
127,These are great. I have beats as well and these sound just as good! I went back and ordered 4 i more for everyone in my family. Bonus.. I find them sooooo comfy
128,Very good set of headphone for under $20 I recommend them to anyone looking for a decent set of headphones in this price range
129,In-ear headphones are uncomfortable for kids. This are very comfortable plus have a mic. price is great and the sound very good. U got an extra pair.
130,"They're good, the cushions doesn't put strain on your ears . Its jus the drivers inside that makes the sound not so rich. But overall I'll recommend these. If you want these to sound they're best I recommend getting an equalizer"
131,"I like these but I bought a Hifi Elite headset at the same time. The bass/sound quality of the Hifi Elite is better, but these are good go leave near my PC for Skype etc."
132,"Used twice now, so far, so good! Headphones are just a little smaller than expected but it's not a huge deal."
133,"The ear size is too small and uncomfortable to wear, he sound is not good as expected"
134,"These headphones are great, the microphone is a massive increase in quality from my last one. Fairly comfortable as well for almost constant use. I can't really notice a difference in sound quality, but that is probably because I don't care or pay attention, but it does sound pretty good to me."
135,"Nice product, my kid was excited. He feels hood now because he knowwwwws not to ask for my Beats. Lol
They are loud, foldable, and stylish."
136,Lightweight. Sturdy. Use for professional radio shows on the road. Surprised at how good sound quality was on play back and record.
137,Had to return it due to poor sound quality.
138,"I bought these for work. They are very comfortable, I do wish that the cord could have been a foot longer, but it is not that big a deal."
139,Unfortunately the metal piece that inserts into the device broke off the first time these were used. We did buy others of the same (different colors though ) that work well! Giving 3 out of five because 2 out of three of our headphones were good.
140,The headphones are great. Can't beat the price.
141,"I love these. I have an issue with background noise making it very hard to hear while talking on phone. These drown out the noise and the voices are crystal clear. I have had great feedback from my listeners as well who say they can hear me crystal clear too. Over all I am very, very happy with this purchase. I have spent a lot more for a lot less product."
142,My husband needed a work headset without a bulky microphone but that stayed on easily and blocked out sound. these work nice.
143,"It was nice the first few weeks, but after about 2 weeks the right ear of the headphone stopped working. And now the headphone stopped working altogether. I bought this about a month ago. I'm not judging but this is kind of unexpected."
144,Comfortable to wear. It sounds great for study jams! The microphone though did not last very long. I had this for about 4 months and the microphone just stopped working.
145,"Ordered these for my parents to use on a trip. Headphones have great sound and stylish looks. They are comfortable to wear and the cord is the right length. Just wish they were Bluetooth, as parents wanted them to pair with all their gadgets and smart TV."
146,"they work and sound great, thank you"
147,Really good headphones. Fairly priced.
148,Best purchase I have made in a long time. Sound is excellent and very well made for the reasonable price. Bought 2 for gifts and they love them.
149,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He wanted something with the ""Beats"" look so I told him to search Amazon and he found these. The delivery was quick and my boyfriend absolutely loves them. He uses them Id say 5 days a week when hes on Xbox. Quality and sound are great and couldn't beat the price! Great buy, totally recommend."
150,I love these headphones. I bought them to use with my silent violin. The sound quality is excellent!
151,"The headphones are excellent but, did not worked for my intended use. Overall, they are worth the money."
152,Bought these for my nephew and he loves them
153,"These worked fine for 2 months then the microphone stopped working. The audio is average, they are pretty low budget. The microphone sound was good until yesterday. Oh well."
154,"They seem sturdy enough and are comfortable. I am a transcriptionist so I wear them for hours on end while I type what I hear verbatim. The sound is clear and they cancel noise adequately enough I can keep the volume low. -1 star because they make a lot of noise when I move my head or neck, more than any other headphones I've ever owned. not really an issue."
155,I bought these headphones for my husband and they look great as well as function very well. My husband especially liked the fact that the fold for easy packing.
156,Great sound...I own two of them and would not hesitate to get a third if needed!!
157,"for the price these work perfect..all i want them for is to watch movies they serve their purpose perfectly
they fit the ears nicely."
158,My son loves his headphones.
159,"Worked great for about a month and now the headphones are trash. Plays background sounds perfectly but everything is in and out... mostly out! Waste of time and money, Do Not Bother!!!"
160,Just what I had wanted.
161,"It does the job pretty well, but looks fragile. Must be handled with care I guess."
162,I love the Bass I have a ps4 and they work great for being a Mic A Must Buy I'm Going to Buy Another Pair Soon.
163,Very nice headphones
164,"I purchased it on Jan 3rd, it stopped working today on February 4th. While it worked I was very satisfied with the sound and they were comfortable to wear. However, given this product only lasted a little over a month, I can't in good faith recommend it."
165,bought 3 pair of these great at first. All 3 of them are now broken and unusable less than 45 days later.
166,Love these headphones. Very light but produce good quality sound.
167,My brother is going to love these. Thank you
168,better than expected!!!
169,The headset came on time. It was a gift for my daughter and I put it in here Easter basket. After a week of uses only one ear works. The left side ear phone doesn't work at all. I wouldn't buy from them again. I will go to a BestBuy.
170,great sound
171,Best $15 I ever spent. Decent sound quality and they don't squeeze my head so hard I get a headache.
172,My son loves these! We actually just bought a second pair so he can use a set for school and home. Very nice and sturdy quality.
173,"3 days after Amazon return window closed, one side completely quit working. Sound is not too bad. But quality is lacking. You get what you pay for."
174,"Safe, suitably packaged and prompt delivery. Sound quality very good. Comfortable to use and handsome appearance"
175,Good sound and good price level.
176,My god-daughter likes the rich color and the deep bass. The sound is crisp with enhancement of the bass. Best choice!!
177,Work well.
178,Don't let the price fool you. These are great sounding headphones. Purchased to replace an expensive pair these sound great both through the microphone and the ear pieces. Works well with the xbox 360.
179,"I was fooled by the 5 star ratings/reviews, I should've checked out the 1-star reviews about the weak jack. The jack broke just after the 30 day return period. Just glad in didn't break inside the iPad."
180,"Sound is awesome! Caught them on sale, but are definitely worth the regular price."
181,Seems like well built headphones for the price and the sound quality is very good.
182,The kids love them and they seem durable.
183,Fits comfortably and has really good sound. Mic works great too.
184,Had them one month. The one side stopped working.
185,They work well with my laptop computer .
186,"Very old , especially for the price!"
187,"I want to like these headphones, but if nothing is playing there's just an awful static I hear instead. I like wearing headphones at my computer, even if nothing is playing.
They do the same on my phone too."
188,"The noise cancelling is not as great as other headphones I have tried, however the microphone portion is great. I don't find them as compatible for the Samsung Galaxy is they say they are."
189,"Great! My son loves these headphones, loves the fact they can fold up and the sound is great"
190,"Bought one before for my son, my daughter really liked it so we got another for her."
191,All I can tell you is my teen loves it and actually did chores as a thank you.
192,Amazon delivered as promised. Headphones were a great buy for the price and.they work great!!
193,"Great one of the best head phones I have ever purchased for that price. The color is beautiful , It is light weigh and very comfortable. Would have give 5stars if it had a case"
194,"worked great for 2 months, then out of nothing just stopped working."
195,Just what I needed!
196,These are great headphones - excellent value for the price!
197,Excellent product at excellent price.
198,"O..K, these are a screamin deal. High quality construction, foldable, adjustable, and superb, clear, sound. I'm impressed."
199,nice
200,I like the compactness when folded and the noise cancellation aspects work pretty good for such a reasonable cost.
201,These are amazing! Love the great sound and you don't have to put volume up on your device too high. Music nice and clear with great bass! Very happy with my purchase!!!
202,this is my second pair super plus
203,"The sound quality is fine, but I haven't found these to be good for listening to music that has any bass in it. You're not going to hear the bass at all."
204,"After just over two months, these headphones are already broken. Beyer beware. These are cheap headphones and you will find yourself buying a replacement before you know it."
205,Quality and sound
206,"These are excellent headphones for the price. If you are looking for a corded set, I don't think you can beat this deal. They're bulky, but they do fold to stow. I'm enjoying the rich sound."
207,Worked fine for two months but now the audio jack is sometimes coming lose while it's plugged in to my phone for some reason and I lose the audio altogether. I take good care of my electronics so I don't know why this issue has come up.
208,"broke after several months and the company will not respond to replace, even though warranty if for a year"
209,These are the best headphones I have ever purchased. The sound quality was more than expected. Love how they fold together...consume less space...so far so good...These are GREAT.
210,They work great! Bought these headphones as a gift & have't had any problems. They are pretty loud in volume not to mention the audio sounds great.
211,I was really enjoying using these headphon but three weeks in the sound just went dead in both ears surprisingly very disappointed I really wanted these to be good but you get what you pay for i guess.
212,"They work great and my daughter loves the color,this was great you don't hear any noise outside of wearing these headphones"
213,So far I'm happy with this purchase. Looks good and comfortable
214,"These have nice sound. I have not used the microphone yet so I can't say how well it works. As headphones they have nice bass, and the sound is great. Overall they are a good set of headphones. They also fold up, making it easy to store."
215,Poorly made
216,Love the headphones. They look really good. Hardly hear any outside noise and they sound great.
217,Awesome sound n very comfortable!
218,"One ear makes an uncomfortable popping sound if any pressure is applied to the outside of the headphone, and the mic being inline makes it potentially very loud for anyone you might be talking to if it brushes up against your clothing."
219,"Given as a gift and the recipient loves them! Excellent sound quality, comfortable to wear and easy to store. Definitely recommend!"
220,Excellent sound quality. Good product.
221,"Microscope didn't work, no matter how hard I tried! DO NOT BUY"
222,good sound and comforta ble
223,I was delighted with these headphones their well-built fold nicely and the sound is great
224,"Clear, reliable sound. Decent bass. Mic doesnt always work with computer programs like skype or Hangouts, but maybe i have to change setting somewhere. Mic works well with my phone though!
Solid investment. This is my second pair. > accidentally sat on the last pair:-/ <"
225,"I ordered this product used it for 2 weeks at home with iphone6 no longer works can't return because ""return window"" is closed! NOT HAPPY"
226,Excellent headphones at a great price
227,"They did break in a little over a month, however I think that was more of my fault than the product. Great sound quality and really comfortable."
228,"I'm not using this yet, I buy them for a trip but the sound is good, but do not cancel the noise just reduce a little bit. Anyway I love the can fold and they are not heavy that is important for me because I do not need my headphones get heavy with all the stuff that I need to bring in a trip."
229,These are really nice
230,"This is my second purchase, first was for myself and this is a gift for a family member. I love it! Very comfortable for long hours and quick needs. Easily folds, good quality."
231,"I bought 2 and within a week one of them started working only intermittently, a few days later it stopped working completely."
232,My grandson's love them
233,"Great headphones. Nice, thick, weaved cable (instead of rubber). Doesn't snag or crimp."
234,Nice fit but it keeps disconnecting when I make or receive phone calls. Sending them back.
235,They are not beats but they are not $300 either. Great value for the money.
236,"They arrived on time, seem to be of good quality and fold up nicely. My son (age 7 yrs) used them and said they worked well."
237,These are very good headphones. I am very hard of hearing and am able to hear my Kindle well.
238,These headphones really exceeded my expectations. Deep bass sound and very stylish. I use mine at work to analyze employee work and also music. Great product.
239,Oh man... I had no clue they would be this good! Just got em today and in the office where folks are loud. Can't hear them at all and I barely have the volume at like 15-20%. Will definitely get me some more for home/travel!!!
240,Quality product w/ excellent sound!
241,works fine
242,"Bass is extremely disappointing. I know these aren't expensive headphones, but the $9 ifrogz headphones from Walmart sound WAY BETTER. I will be returning these."
243,exactly as described
244,I gave as a gift.
245,"these headphones were pretty good (great sound quality, very noise-cancelling, albeit kind of small) except i had them plugged into my computer and when i unplugged them, the plug got stuck in the computer and broke off of the headphones."
246,for the price they are pretty good
247,I love it there are the ones that I have looked for long time thanks KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
248,Grandson wanted these he says he loves them
249,"It wasn't so bad... I used it for a few hours before my ears started to hurt, but after a couple weeks or so it stopped working. I suggest it if you are just listening to music or something but I don't recommend it if you want to use it for playing video games."
250,I have paid a lot scratch for big name head only to be disappointed these however are awesome very good sound and nicely built
251,Amazing sound ! They are loud and I can't even hear myself speak when I listen to these ! I bought them for my bf and tried them out they are awesome just be careful because when you fold and unfold them their a little stiff so don't break them when unfolding them .
252,Worst headphones. Lasted less than a week.
253,Definitely some nice headsets for the money. I bought these instead of turtle beaches.
254,Wanted a good pair without the big price. So far the I60 has held up great. Sound is crisp and the headphones block about 90% of the ambient noise. Also very comfortable. They do come with a mic but have found that wen I use with my phone I can't hear what I am saying.
255,"""inline volume controls"" ??? Never able to find controls of any kind. Not impressed. Way too big for phone use."
256,"Decent, good sound, comfy."
257,"The sound only works in one ear, I am very disappointed"
258,Great headphones. The sound quality is terrific.
259,"Perfect for me, a mom who does not need a name brand good quality and sound"
260,"Great little headphones, so far no issues."
261,"I like these headphones don't get me wrong, but the quality is mediocre on some parts. however the wire feels great and the pads for the ears are good the rest is... eh."
262,"They were pretty good at first but didn't last long, the sound went out on the left ear and then would come back then go out.. We went on vacation and on the plane they both went out.. good while they lasted"
263,They are great headphones & I love them.
264,No problems
265,My son has been very pleased with these headphones. They are comfortable and the sound quality has been great. They are priced at a great value. The gold finish is very nice and unusual and goes with his gold colored laptop.
266,Good headphones with great sound. It mimics a surround sound system and is really nice. My only problem is that after wearing for an extended period of time it starts to hurt my ears. But it might be a personal problem.
267,great product low price
268,The best.....
269,great product very happy with it
270,Love these headphones they were deliver quickly and they have a very rich sound. I'm able to talk over the internet without any problems.
271,Great!
272,Quality is pretty good but the cushions aren't that soft and hurt my ears after a shorter time than expected.
273,"Very comfortable. The microphone is great. Hopefully I won't have to get another pair, but if I do, I'll buy this brand. Thanks for a great product."
274,Not the best out there but if you're looking for good headphones at a typically low price I recommend these.
275,"Seem to work okay, but unless it was repackaged (despite being a new product), there should be a volume control included. The box says that they feature ""volume control"", but they do not.
Also they didn't come with any instructions for the remote, which seems pretty strange."
276,These are very good headphones. Really cuts out the noise from around me while providing good quality sound.
277,it headphones but the cable snags and broke. if they had a detachable cable like beats it would be a 5 star
278,"Great product. I like headphones with a wire, charging wireless headphones is just to much trouble for me. The cost is very reasonable, I loose things to easily. The wire is cloth covered, untangles easily. Sound quality is great. It has good looks and folds up nicely for storage."
279,On our second pair of headphones and the microphone went out within the first month. Very unhappy with this brand. The first pair took 6 months for microphone to go out. Will not be buying these again!!!
280,"Sounds great, feels great, awesome price. I use it mostly with my PS4. No complaints."
281,my daughter loves them and they look amazing. defiantly worth it ^_^
282,What a great bang for the buck. I use this for skype calls and the sound is clear and mic is good. Very happy with the purchase.
283,"Good quality for the price: sharp look, comfortable fit , and great sound."
284,"Can't believe the quality of these headphones. Adjustable fit is very comfortable, noise canceling and the bass is unreal. You won't be disappointed in this purchase."
285,Bought this for an upcoming trip. We'll have to wait to see how it works.
286,great sound and price!
287,work find.
288,"The headphones are very very comfortable. Since I use them for my cellphone and still want to hear what is around me I can comfortably adjust the fit so I hear through my right ear, thus ""freeing"" up my left ear. I am very happy with this purchase."
289,They were nice while they lasted. I've had them for 6 months and they are already defective. I have to constantly twirl the input to hear sound. It cuts in and out constantly when I'm moving with my phone in my hand.
290,"I like it, but doesn't have a volume control"
291,Works good. Breaks super easy though.
292,My husband loves these headphones. Thanks for an awesome gift- good quality and color.
293,This is our 3rd headphones set and we are very satisfied with them.
294,"These headphones are average I've had better but had worse, they do hurt the ears after just about an hour. They have a cool design and had pretty good sound bass is ok but if u try to watch a movie with them u would think u were in a bathroom with all the echo. All in all good product for price"
295,"Got them very quickly! They're for my almost 10 year old daughter and she's going to love them. Silly, but the sleek black box they come in make them looks more expensive than they are. Gonna be a big hit!"
296,"Works wonderful, and great customer service"
297,I LOVE them! The bass is rich and really good but it doesn't do a good job when you're listening to songs that focus a lot on treble
298,used for school good product
299,"Worked great, until they didn't, just 3 months into using them (and a month after the return window closed) - definitely not worth the money!"
300,My son loves them.
301,Right speaker went out after two weeks.
302,"Great price. Also, great for using on my laptop when looking at Facebook or Videos. The only thing I don't care for is I still hear background noises around me from my husband's TV or microwave, etc."
303,I bought these for my son. They arrived quickly and sound great. He uses them for gaming and music and loves them. Great quality for the price
304,Broke right away. Had it for 2 weeks.
305,"Works great, love the gold!!"
306,Got these for my husband to use while recording his podcast and he LOVES them!
307,Worked for three months perfectly loved them but now they are broken just like every pair of cheap headphones won't work unless I continuously move the plug
308,"Stopped working cord doesn't connect properly returned today, need sturdy connection point"
309,"So so headphones. Sounds okay but no volume control, only a little button for on off. I bought is similar priced product as well for my kids which had a volume control and will give that product a 5 stars for value."
310,"I was very excited to finally get these headphones, however after using them for 2 weeks the right headphone stopped emitting sound. Horrible buy!!"
311,"For a pair of $20 headphones, they work very well. Fair sound quality, excellent noise isolation, comfortable, and a nice design to go along. However, the headphones do leak sound when listening to music on high volumes. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase but don't expect studio quality."
312,"I live in hands-free Vermont, we need headphones to use our mobile phones in a car (or truck, in my case) and these work great!"
313,excellent product-comfortable-clear-reasnable price-highly recommended
314,Great product my son love them. I tried them great sound and noise cancellation.
315,Not good
316,"I am not unhappy with the headphones I purchased except that they do no lock on my head, therefore they fall off when I'm walking around let's say listening to podcasts and cleaning. Any suggestions?"
317,Nice!
318,Cool headphones 🎧 just as good as dr.dre beats and dont have to use batteries for them just plug them in i do recommend these to people.
319,This product was shipped and delivered on time. The sound isnt the best but you get what you pay for. I have no problems with the headphones. It does what its suppose to. I would order from Ailihen again.
320,Daughter loves them
321,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a child. The headphones seem well designed and built. They fit comfortably on both a child and adult head. I'm impressed and would recommend them.
322,Earphones have stopped working already...just under 3 months now I need to b purchase another pair for my....the earphones were supposed to be durable but they could not hold up to daily use only within a little under 3 months. They were a Christmas gift for my son
323,"I am not an audiophile by any means, but... I love these!!! The sound and range / bass is great!!"
324,"Maybe it was my phone but these headphones were very low. If i had kanine hearing i would give it 5 stars but they look good. I just dont like to look at them, id rather listen to them."
325,"GREAT BASS,CLEAR MUSIC, LOVE THEM, GREAT VALUE"
326,Decent. Speakers for the cost
327,Had a week. Every item we used the headphones on it worked differently. On my iPad it worked normal. My cellphone only one ear worked. My sons PS4 controller people couldn't hear him talk. When they work they are great.
328,Great...!!
329,"They're comfortable and they do the job. There is a little bit of static when there's no sound coming through, but while listening to something they're fine."
330,great sound!
331,"I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this.The price was cheap.I have to say having this now,what a bargain it was.I use it for calling people.Everyone says that it sounds fantastic."
332,"Nice set of headphones for a price I'm good with. I'm not an audiophile, but they sound good to me. The noise cancellation is nothing major, but it's enough to take the edge off of my bus commute. Plus, they fold up for semi-easy storage. A nice headphone experience overall."
333,Plug came off inside my controller.......
334,"Great headphones for the money. Use them for recording and they do a great job of isolating background noise and truly reflecting what is being played. Bass is strong, major plus. Better than most more expensive headphones"
335,Great earphones. Sound quality is really good can't complain. One minor thing the cord is really long a plus is some instances a small hassle in others.
336,"Awesome sounding headphones, great fit, great cord length, very comfortable when working out. Great Job"
337,Christmas gift to my grandson--he loved it!
338,"Plug breaks easily along with mic... not recommend for gaming, but for casual listening it will do the job"
339,"Sound incredible!!! Good as beats headphones, but without the pricetag!!! Great buy!!!"
340,"Ear pads are small on my ears ,microphone hard to figure out"
341,"Purchased for my son. He loves them. They are great headphones for preteens..Asthetically pleasing, and they don't cost an arm and a leg, and they work great for the YouTube watching, game playing, etc."
342,"At first the headphones worked fine and look great, but they quit working after 2 months. Shipping was poor. Product arrived several days after expected."
343,"The headset is nice, comfortable and works well."
344,For my grandson but tried them out and they are great. Well made
345,It works
346,"I have used more expensive headphones that didn't compare to the Ailhen I60's. Not only is the sound good, the headphones block out most ambient noise, including screaming hollering kids,wife, or many other unwanted noise."
347,"Great sound, great look, great fit. I'll let you know in a few months how they hold up."
348,"I bought these headphones for my 11 year old daughter, and she LOVES them. She loves what they look like, says the sound is great and says they are VERY comfortable!"
349,"Love these headphones. Purchased for use on my iPhone, iPad and Mac, they are very lightweight and the folding design makes them super easy to transport."
350,cord went bad really quick
351,"My son really likes these. They fold up conveniently. The only drawback is that they hurt his ears after awhile, but he says that's just a good reminder not to wear them too long."
352,Bought these for my grandson and he loves them. He says they are comfy and the sound is clear.
353,one side quit right away. They may look nice but i would not recommend them!
354,Great Sound Quality
355,"My son loves them. Comfortable fit, great sound. Received a 20% off coupon with the order. My daughter likes them, too, so we just used the coupon to order another pair for her."
356,"Bought this for my husband and used it for a work call, it was great! Buying one for myself now!"
357,Cool love them.
358,Broke after just a few months of use. Very disappointed.
359,"Aux cord broke as soon as my son plugged it to his phone, I have to get his brand new phone fix to get the little pieces out...smh(this is my first bad review in 5-6 years)"
360,The audio quality is better then expected! Ordered for daughter but ended up keeping for gaming and ordering another set for her.
361,I bought these for my 11 year old son. They fit great and are comfortable on him.
362,"Great headphones.The sound quality and material are outsanding for the price.. I had bought a pair of Sony ones at Best Buy for a much higher price, which I returned after I tried this one. I also ordered a second pair for my daughter.. highly recommended!!"
363,Great headphones great stereo in really blocks out the noise even if there's nothing playing hoping I don't break them like every other pair that I have gotten in the past
364,Great headphones... Fast ship
365,"Excellent quality for a low price! Great sound quality and comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time (which I do, as I'm a walker). I'm very happy with this purchase."
366,"I love these headphones, but they broke recently. they are extremely high quality but break easily"
367,"Great head phones for a good price !
The head phones adjust to fit the size of your head.. they are comfortable and stay on well not to mention great sound quilty. Definitely buy again"
368,Just what I needed.
369,"The headphones are extremely comfortable and provide good sound quality while doing a good job in blocking out outside noise. I was so pleased, I ordered a second one immediately to have as a replacement or as a gift."
370,My child uses it with a fm system in school. He said it works well.
371,"This was a birthday present for my 11 year old son. He absolutely loves it. It is exactly as advertised. Great quality, great price."
372,Great sound. Keeps noise out well. Very comfortable to wear.
373,"A good headphone for its price. It hurts the ears though, after a couple of hours. The holes for the ears should not be round. It costs just as much to make them oblong to accommodate most ears."
374,Just bought another one.
375,"Heavy, doesn't fit on ear, got ear pain, sound quality is ok"
376,Works as hoped. No complaints.
377,"As soon as I opened the box, my dad took the headphones out, tried them on, and kept them, so I ended up having to buy a second pair. I love them and so does he. They are exactly what I was looking for: comfortable, over the ear, noise cancelling, and sleek."
378,"Not only the sound is fantastic, but it nearly cancels out surrounding noise. It is also comfortable and stylish. I'd definitely recommend these headphones to anyone."
379,"fit well, sound good"
380,vary cheap feel but works ok
381,My son (8) bought these and he loves them. Thanks for proving something that has both good sound quality and is affordable!
382,"Bought them for my son in 8th grade for school
He said they work great.
The price point is good because anytime an electronics goes to school anything could happen to it."
383,"Died before a month, threw away the box..cannot return"
384,loved these
385,Solid purchase. Had it for a few days. I like the material they used for the cord.
386,one of the set of two i bought stop working a day after use
387,good
388,Great design and very good product. works as advertised
389,"The product is great when taking into account the price. It feels comfortable, has good sound, and looks nice!"
390,"sounds great, am going to order another."
391,Very nice sound quality. Bought for my 12-yea-old son and he loves them.
392,Great headphones with what i think of as awsome sound quality.
393,"great item, great sound. affordable."
394,I received the item in a timely manner and the sound is good for the money. I like the cord because it doesn't get twisted up. I would recommend this product to a friend.
395,Hasn't lasted that long. My only issue is that the wire that connects the the headphone piece is messing up and won't emit sound unless places a certain way
396,These worked great for about 2 months. Now the sound isn't coming through unless you jiggle the cord around a bit. Pretty bummed about it.
397,Headset came with mic not working properly.
398,Very nice. I loved them so much. High quality voice and soft to the ears. Also you can fold them and keep them in a small space. On top of that very affordable price.
399,These were definitely my fave but it's been less than a month and the cord is fraying. I use them when recording and editing my show and I can't afford my equipment breaking just from general use. I'm disappointed
400,I cannot agree more with the soft material it says it is made. Volume is great and easy to put away. Highly recommended
401,No noise-cancellation from my talking colleagues. Audio is good.
402,Headphones were a little heavy but not bad. The sound was very good
403,"Great product for the price, and blocking out the world."
404,Really good for the price. Only 3 stars because the product stopped functioning properly. The wiring on the headset might be soldered improperly.
405,Nice product. Arrived on time thanks
406,Arrived quick. Super good quality sound. Sturdy. I feel confident it will last a long time.
407,"Its an absolutely great product however I thought there was a volume button as I saw on the Amazon post? However it""s an awesome product"
408,"The sound is really good, but the only thing that bothered me was that after about 1/2 hr it stated to bother my ears. In general they are ok."
409,The headsets were great but after 4 days they stopped working and I tried to email and two weeks later still no answer. I do not recommend them since they don't stand behind the product.
410,Our customers said they can't hear a word when we use it. Will be returning the item.
411,"Good quality, good fit, good sound, seems sturdy. Bought for pre-teen and they liked them."
412,My nine year old son LOVES these! I only wish they came with a storage pouch. They seem like they are good quality and hardy.
413,These are great headphones as well as being very aesthetically pleasing.
414,love them
415,Used on overseas flights really quieted engine noise. Hard plastic hard to lay head on
416,Great!
417,"They're more beautiful than the pic. Sound quality is epic and the packaging was well supported. So no scratches, bumps or bruises seen."
418,The sound stop playing on the left year
419,Worst product.Stopped working after couple of months.
420,OMG this headset sounds amazing... Love it.
421,Where is the volume control. No instruction card.
422,Bought two pairs of these for my husband and I love the way they work
423,Great sound and fit
424,Got these for my 11yr old to go on a trip. He loves them...I put them on and its a very good quality sound. I would recommend these to anyone.
425,Love these !! Great sound and super comfy !!!
426,"You notice the drop in noise as soon as you put them on, even before the music starts. Annoying co-workers? Put these babies on and block them out. Turn the music on and you will be in your own world, getting your work done without wanting to scream at the people around you. I am NOT a big music person who cares about the bass or whatever. I am strictly one who wants to drown out the soap opera going on around me, put on some music that will get me moving and get my work done. I can't answer any questions about technical stuff, but I can tell you that they play loud and you will NOT hear anything but what you are listening to."
427,"For the price, those headphones are amazing. I have a stepson who plays music and these block out drum sounds. A must buy!"
428,i enjoy them not bad
429,Great sound quality and the microphone is awesome too...use it with iPhone 6
430,"I bought these, and when they came, I was very happy, the folding is a good bonus. I travel a lot and these will be helpful. they look great, and they're great for the price!"
431,Great sound and fit for the price
432,"Good unit , but I intend to upgrade to another of your other headphones , but this one works pretty well for now ."

437,Love it. The mic that came along works pretty good.
438,"great headphones for the kids, looks great and works well."
439,Good
440,"Works great for the price, but $20 is $20. Don't expect a miracle. If you need them for chatting, online gaming casual use, it's a great value."
441,These headphone is spectacular. The sound is great quality and my husband love his very own ALIEN I60 BASS HEADPHONES.
442,"These headphones are just so really awesome !!!!
I use them at the gym and just get lost in my music. Really recommend these to everyone"
443,"I paid for 2 day shipping and I got them in the time I could've if I got standard free shipping,I'd like my money back for that but overall good headphone with great sound quality with nice nylon cord cover."
444,Product as stated.positive experience!!
445,"I got them a week ago. What a great listening experience and a great price. Music, podcast and phone, all sound great."
446,Stopped working in 5 days. Pure garbage.

450,One side stopped working in a couple of weeks. Poor purchase.
451,Plug in jack broke a couple weeks after having them.
452,Bought for my son for xmas. They work great so far. The sound is pretty good and the sound can really be cranked up.
453,"Good headphones. Unfortunately one of the pairs I bought broke within two weeks and they have an extremely long cord. If I could remake this decision, I would go with ear buds."
454,"They work great, and the sound is awesome. I had to purchase microphone heaphones for a class and they are perfect."

473,Headphones sound good but wish it could be a little bit louder
474,Great set of headphones! Great functions. Nothing complex or cheap.
475,These headphones are amazing for me so far I have no complaints. I just wish they were over the ear and not on the ear for more comfort. But other than that the sound is incredible.
476,Received in good condition and it was a gift
477,the plug on these fell apart three days into using them
478,Great quality and love the sound!!

569,One happy boy at Christmas.
570,Got a pair of these for my grandson---who really liked them!
571,Not even 3 months use and already broken. Used very delicately even.
572,Sound is alright but the actual headpiece is flimsy as all hell.
573,It stopped working after 3 months
574,"It's a Christmas gift, so have not opened it yet"
575,Its got good sound- just a little bulky when you wear it.
576,"This was a Christmas gift, and it was a big hit"
577,"These are very well made head phones. They come in a folded configuration. You pop open each side and then you can adjust the height on each side. The plug fits the speaker slot on any MAC computer or any iPhone. The sound quality on the computer is not as good when speaking when connected to the computer as it is on the iPhone. On the computer, you pick up the sounds of the fan which on an older model can be very loud. The earpieces are very comfortable and I like the fit better than ear buds. Overall, great headphones for the price - especially if you want to pair them with your iPhone.

578,"Bad sound quality, my 2 cents."

610,These headphones are great for what I use them for which is working out at the gym. They are lightweight and very comfortable. The volume is not as loud as I would like. I like my classic rock and like it loud. The quality of sound is what I would expect from headphones of this price. No real definition of instruments. A bit muddy. For the price they are fine.
611,Plugged them into a iPhone V and use it for hands free phoning. Sounds good and works so far ...
612,This was a gift for my son and I was very impressed with it especially for the price I would recommend it

653,"Overall I give these four stars. The sound quality is good. Mid-ranges are a bit muddy, but the bass really is surprisingly rich! No major complaints here, however I will say that I feel the sizing on these headphones is on the petite side, better suited for women or adolescents perhaps as my husband's head was too large for these to be comfortable on him. I found them a perfect fit myself though, and plan to keep them!"

729,These phones are great. Just what I needed tocover the noise the TV make when my other half that can't hear cranks up the volume so she can hear the TV. I use them on a desk top ans watch Star Wars. I hear all the music that I never knew was there until I used these head phones and they are Exellant for small sounds that you do not hear when you watch a disc thru a player.

784,"I own and operate my own recording studio and own several different pairs of headphones ranging in quality. I ordered the i60's after my old pair of Skullcandy Hesh wore out, just as a casual listening pair while I'm traveling, writing, etc.

What must be understood is that these headphones are affordable for a reason. They are not high-end and the sound quality is ok but not great. They are a little bassy as over-ear headphones can be but the clarity is significantly less than what you would get with a better pair of headphones.

That said, the value is pretty outstanding. The cord is long and covered with a sturdy woven material, the headpiece is comfortable and they fold up nicely. For under $20, it's a good buy. Just don't expect them to sound crystal clear or to be good for any serious or professional listening."
785,"Worked well when they did, i bought them roughly two weeks ago. They recently have been cutting out if the cord is touched the wrong way, and when they don't work, the audio is absolutely horrible. Otherwise, the audio was fantastic and personally the sound cancellation is very effective.
If the problems become unbearable in a short time, I will return these."
786,My kid loved these headphones. The color is amazing and rich. She loved the sound and noise cancelling for watching her favorite shoes on her Kindle. Then she dropped the Kindle which was fine by the way and the encasement around the connector broke. That's that! So much for her favorite X-mas gift.
787,"Great headphones for the money, their a excellent value. My kids love them, and I'll definitely be buying a few more pairs for my other kids as well."
788,"Just received these and am already loving them! They are easily adjustable and very light weight. I personally hate earbuds...they are uncomfortable and tend to fall out often. These headphones are comfortable...and since they cover the ears they are better at cutting outside noise and give a deeper, more stereotype sound. Best for sitting and enjoying music, movies, etc. I would most definitely recommend these for anyone who, like me, just don't like earbuds!
Only reason I don't give them five stars is because I don't yet know how they will perform in the long run."
789,"Worked ok for a week with gentle use. Then stopped working entirely. Just ok sound, terrible quality product."
790,I purchased these for doing conference calls on my laptop for work. The headphones are excellent. The only problem is they do such a good job of outside noise reduction that I have a hard time hearing myself when I speak. As a fix I just move them slightly off my ears.
791,i purchased these for a friend going to italy for a couple of weeks. he loved them and happy he had them on his 8 hour flight!! great price and definitely were helpful to keep out noise when watching movies. would definitely buy again. maybe ill get a pair for myself too!!
792,I gave this a why CORD. I have to play with it meaning when put it in I HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE CORD. To hear both sides. HOWEVER this MAY BE A RECALL. TECHNICALLY always IMPROVING
793,"After using them two times, they don't work. Very disappointing."
794,"Excellent earphones for the price. The noice reduction quality is excellent, and the sounds are pure. The cord is substantial, wrapped in a material to keep it from linking. Very satisfied with this purchase."
795,They are fine for someone that likes a headphone that goes around the whole ear. I don't. After putting them on I decided I probably won't ever use them. I would prefer a headphone that is soft foam that just sits one the ear. Not around it. Oh well.
796,Ugh! I never do reviews I'm not going to lie. I'm lazy. But I'm so annoyed with these headphones. I should have at least read the reviews. We've had these for less than a week! Already they aren't working. When using to watch videos/movies they crack and cut out and when trying to use them for calls or playing online you can't hear the person on the other end. DO NOT BUY THESE! They are a waste of time and money! Returning!
797,"Buy these headphones while you can, judging from Amazon' huge discount, they will not be around
much longer. Outstanding performance, outstanding quality."
798,Great sound quality! I bought these for my twelve year old son for Christmas and he uses them almost every day. They are perfect. Lots of people have marveled at the neat way they fold up and how comfortable they feel.
799,"I bought these for my 14-year-old son and he absolutely loves them! They are nice looking, have great sound quality, and are very comfortable! The size adjusted easily for my older sons who tried them and also found them to be good quality. Great purchase for the cost!!!"
800,"I'm very happy with these headphones. Good, deep base, the microphone works very well, even in noisy environments, and the headphones do a great job of blocking out surrounding noise. An absolute steal for this price."
801,My son loves these and little brother liked them so much he begged for some for Christmas so we already have them ordered and on their way!
802,"UPDATE 9/13/2017: I had to drop a star for low durability. The headphones snapped and broke in the headband while just sitting on my head, 9 months into ownership. I am dissapointed.
*********
So I had to really think about how I wanted to review this product. Here goes:

What you're getting: Really good $20 headphones.
What you're not getting: Really good $50 headphones.

If I had just bought these without reading reviews, I would have really liked them. But having read almost unanimous glowing reviews, my expectations were a little higher... and were disappointed. So the details:

Style: Apparently this detail matters to people. I think they look cool enough, but I don't really trust my fashion sense, so whatever.

Durability: It hasn't broken in the week since amazon delivered it. Its construction seems strong enough that I'm not afraid something will break if I sneeze too hard. Will update if I have worse results as time goes on.

Sound Quality: I'd score it 8/10, or, ""pretty good."" I wasn't really looking for more than that, so I'm happy, though reviews lead me to expect better. It seems like they put a lot of effort [succesfully] in having an effective base, and clear trebles. The weakness is with the mids, which sound a bit muddy and indistinct to a picky ear.

Comfort: This is my main complaint with these headphones. I was particularly looking for headphones designed/reviewed for comfort, because I've experienced the frustration of constant ear-ache 30 minutes into whatever you're listening to. Description/reviews glowed for the comfort of this product.

Well... I got them, and 30 minutes in... ear-ache. They're actually worse than my previous, lower quality earphones. It's improved some since I first got them, as usage has stretched them a little wider so they don't press so tight against my head. But I thought I was buying ""comfortable"" and I got, ""Not as bad as it was at first."" In the future, I'll probably limit myself to ""Over the Ear"" instead of ""On the Ear.""

For anyone interested in the level of noise isolation: I can still hear my baby crying [though muffled], but my wife has repeatedly walked up behind me and scared the crap out of me. So yeah. Take that how you will."
803,"I paid only $18 for these headphones and I am blown away by the quality of the sound + bass, as well as the level of comfort! I wasn't expecting much for that price, so I am very happy. The box states the sound quality is made for iPods and iPhones, but the sound quality is amazing on my Android phone. I did my research before purchasing these over the ear headphones and feel this must be the best on the market for the price."
804,"Received today and used right out of the package. Comfy to wear however I hear ""Snow"" in the background. The caller on the other end didn't hear it but I do on my end which is very distracting while on conference calls. Glad I didn't pay $50 or I would have returned them.

Update review: Now that I had a chance to wear these for a few different conference calls I am updating this review to one star. Not only is the ""Snow"" is extremely loud but I found that after wearing these for longer than an hour I have a massive headache. I was hoping that in time these would improve however they just seem to get worse. I will need to purchase another brand since I can't wear these any longer. I am very disappointed in these headphones. :("
805,Awesome
806,Great Product!
807,The headphone part of the unit sounded great on music. The inline mike sounded terrible to everybody I called. Looking for a different unit now.
808,product was too good!!! sound quality was too well and I formed an addiction to these headsets. 0/13
809,"Doesn't work well with ps4, low sound."
810,So far so good! Great product for great price!
811,The christmas gift was a hit!!!! thank you!!!
812,"Horrible headset, stopped working after 2 weeks!!! Price was attractive so bought it, worst quality headset in the world, don't waste your time or money!"
813,They fit my 5 year old son head perfect. He loves them and they are exactly what his teacher asked me for him to have for the school year!
814,Bought them for my grandson and he loves them.
815,Great product good value also
816,"Audio quality is good, but the headphones don't fit large heads very well."
817,Microphone DOES NOT WORK for gaming... Should not even mansion having it...
818,"Seem good, haven't used them yet."
819,Stopped working in one ear in 3 weeks. Poor wiring.
820,Trying to see how microphone works
821,These headphones will only last about 5 weeks then one side loses sound. We've had 2 sets and this happened to both sets. I would not buy these again.
822,Not enough cushion on head section...painful over small amount of time.
823,Good not great sound quality. Works well enough for intended use.
824,"The shipping was quicker than expected and the headphones exceeded my expectations. My pre-teen is going to LOVE THEM! They are very stylish and seem to be made well. They have a modern ""cool"" look and are well padded for comfort. I can't say how the sound quality is because they are a Christmas gift but I'll update. I can't believe I found these for the price."
825,"This was a Christmas gift, It is now 3/17 and one side of the headphone does not work and it is beyond the January 31st Amazon holiday return policy. I do not recommend them."
826,The jack Broke within a few weeks.
827,"Don't buy! Cheap plastic junk!

I literally had it delivered 15 minutes ago, upon unboxing and trying it out , it broke in my iPhone.

The housing had a crack and is very cheaply made!

Don't buy!"
828,"After a week of normal use, the volume control seems to fluctuate on it's own, and the sound goes in and out, loud and soft. This replaced an iSound one we'd bought a year earlier, which were a similar style and price and were awesome. We'll look for a new, better brand."
829,"Nice well made headphones.Sound they are surprisingly good and perform well on most music types but as the name implies they are biased for a heavy base which is great in most cases ,on the other hand fantastic for big overtures. They sit on the ears, are comfortable and have enough tension on the headband to keep them in place but not so much that it hurts. For the price an absolute bargain and super for commuting/gardening etc."
830,"Sad to say that I must echo many of the other negative reviews. I purchased these for my husband who uses them solely at his desk at work. To say that there is minimal wear and tear activity is an understatement. They were not dropped, mishandled, mangled or abused and yet one side stopped functioning about three months after purchase. It also sounds as though a part is rolling around inside the ear piece. A total waste of money."
831,"These headphones provide rich, deep sound without broadcasting to everyone around what you are listening to (he was sitting right beside me and I could not hear any sound whatsoever). The fit is very comfortable and they seem to be extremely well made. So happy with this purchase and would recommend.

Please note: A lot of thought is put into my reviews. I write them as I personally rely on reviews when I make a purchase and there is nothing worse than making a purchase only to find out that most of the reviews are either fake or the reviewer didn't pay for the item. If you took the time to read this review and find it helpful, please click the ""yes"" below where it asks ""Was this review helpful to you?"". Thank you!"
832,"So I had these awesome inexpensive headphones that I bought here on Amazon awhile go but my son accidentally broke it. In the meantime, I used an old Skullcandy set to do my transcribing, which I thought were decent and got the job done. But when these arrived, I put them to use immediately and I just LOVE them. I honestly don't think I would have appreciated the sound as much as I do had I not literally JUST taken the Skullcandy headphones off and put these on. It was really night and day. The sound to me is crisp. They're not noise cancelling, but I wasn't expecting them to be. But the biggest difference was that you could hear a huge reduction in excess noise in comparison to the SC I had on. Awesome headphones. I hope they have more colors because I will def buy another. If you've read any of my other reviews you probably know that I'm really big on presentation. These are definitely giftable. The box is matte black with metallic logo. It's very nice that I didn't I actually forgot that I bought headphones and was wondering what I could have bought that looks this expensive."
833,"I have used these consistently for over a week, and I must say I am quite impressed with these headphones. For $20 these are a steal; these would be a steal for $40 in my opinion. The sound is very clear at almost all levels. There is a little static as you get up there, but the sound is so loud that you won't have worry about it being unclear.
The headphones themselves are very comfortable and adjustable, so the one size will fit all. Each side has a good amount of cushion to the point where they are not too bulky, but is still low key. The headphones also have the added bonus of folding for better storage in a backpack.
The cord is braided so the cord will hold together go a good while, but there is one thing that I do not care for. I wish the cord would unplug from the headphones, that way I could roll it up to store is better. But other than that these headphones are great for music, and dialogue."
834,"These headphones are very soft and fit your well. They have a nice length cord and are easy to use with any device. I like that they go to a decent volume and block out most of your other background noise. I had them on 25% with my computer/phone and couldn't hear my kids very easily who were watching TV in the same room. They are nice, sturdy, and heavy duty and I love that they fold down when not in use.

The color is a nice red and black. I think these these headphones are comparable to others and I like them just as much as the expensive pair of Ludicris Soul headphones I own or any Beat products. All together I would recommend these headphones to others because I think they are a pretty decent set of headphones for the price - especially if your kids ruin them fast as mine tend to do."
835,"For a few months, these were great. They fit well and the sound was really clear. Now, after only about 3 months of very minimal use (I only use them at work) the right earphone no longer works. I am super disappointed as I'd have expected these headphones to last awhile.

UPDATE 12/14/17 - Now these don't work at all after moderate use by an adult at work. Save your money folks and don't buy these!"
836,"I was looking for a decent set of headphones that my daughter would like. She keeps losing them or loaning them to her friends which is frustrating. She is super critical of her headphones which I always find a little humorous since she has a hard time keeping track of them. I keep looking for “the one” that she will like and decide to keep track of.

These looked very stylish and simplistic making them a perfect choice. The sound is pretty amazing too considering the price making them an excellent choice everyday use and teens. These are corded which my daughter loves because she isn’t a huge fan of Bluetooth. She wants something she can plug-in and expect to work right away. These are comfortable and have nice padding on the ears without being too tight.

Overall, these have exceeded my expectations. I was provided these headphones free of charge for testing purposes."
837,"They broke after only 3 days and for no apparent reason. The cords are fine, all looks well, no sound....only three days later. I'd say ""no"" to buying these. Now the pain of mailing them back, etc. Ick."
838,"I am very impressed with these headphones. I received a pair as a gift and they do sound good. The ear coverings are soft and comfortable, they have a nice fit, and an attractive look. There is no volume control, which is not a problem because, they can be controlled with the device volume. They are equipped with a microphone for making phone calls. Even the packaging reeks of professionalism, they come packaged in a nice black box with a formed bubble insert to cradle them in place. They also have a 6 month warranty, almost unheard of now days. The black and red design makes for a nice, modern look with a classic feel that I feel comfortable with. Overall, a nice pair of headphones that I would expect to be priced much higher.
Pros:
Nice fit
good sound
nice look

Cons:
Would love to see a wireless version
microphone volume could be a problem on a windy day
microphone is on the cord instead of being on the body of the headphones."
839,"I was expecting much better. The online reviews are generally good, but now I wonder about the validity of those reviews.

PROS: The headphones fold up nicely, and the cord is fabric-covered and tangle-resistant. The headphones have very little creaking when adjusted on your head. There's a fair amount of bass. The tension against the ears is comfortable.

CONS: Muddy sound. My wife and kids all tried the headphones too, and agreed the sound was pretty bad. The top strap of the headphones is poorly padded and gets uncomfortable quickly.

VERDICT: These headphones will make your favorite music sound terrible. Maybe okay for watching movies or TV on a laptop."
840,"My first impression when taking the headphones out of the box was that the quality seemed cheaper than I had anticipated. The original price for these was around $50, and I only paid $13 during a lightening deal. Given their original price, I expected them to be a great pair of headphones. All in all, I wouldn't recommend paying anything more than $20 for them.
Most importantly, the sound quality of these are pretty good (I'd give it a 4.6/5). It's nothing mindblowing, but around the same sound quality as a regular pair of skull candy earbuds. The sound quality doesn't disappoint, and is not a weakness in these headphones.
The quality of the plastic seems on the cheaper end (I'd give it a 3.5/5). Don't get me wrong, it doesn't feel like it would fall apart easily, but for a pair of headphones originally $50, I thought it'd feel more solid and not as light (in a negative way). The quality of the plastic is what makes it seem more like a $20 pair of headphones.
The comfort aspect of these headphones are also a downfall (I'd give it a 3/5). At first, they're just fine, not uncomfortable at all. Nothing superb, just an average pair of headphones. However, after wearing them for an hour they start to hurt my ears from hugging them for so long. It's not exactly a subtle pain, either, it bothers me enough that I have to take off the headphones and switch to earbuds. I would say I have an average size head, too, if not on the smaller side. There's no way to adjust the width of the headphones, so you can't do anything about them being too tight. This really is a pet peeve of mine since the only reason I bought headphones in the first place was the avoid the discomfort of wearing earbuds for too long.
In conclusion, the sound quality is pretty good, but the real downfalls are the quality of the plastic and the lack of comfort after wearing them for too long. If you're considering paying more than $20 for these ($30 at most), I'd recommend looking at other products first."
841,I ordered 2 of my sons a pair of these foldable headphones so that they would be able to watch movies while we are going places. When these headphones arrived I used them on the computer and I was so excited at the awesome sound quality that they provided. My oldest son has also been using them while gaming and they work perfectly for this also! They have crystal clear sound with no crackling background noise like other similarly priced headphones and the voice quality is just as clear. I am now waiting on a third pair for my youngest son and recommend these headphones by AILIHEN to anyone looking for a great pair of reasonably priced foldable headphones!
842,"EDIT AS OF MAY 25, 2017...

I have had two pairs of these headphones break in the past three months and I am not happy. The first pair I thought was my fault, since I dropped them. But I had suspicions about them no longer working after accidentally being dropped once from hip-height. So I ordered a second pair given the decent price... and they came pre-broken! (With the ""speakers"" inside of the earmuffs having come unglued and fallen out-of-place, causing tinny, quiet and poor sound quality.) I tried to fix them myself having had enough of this nonsense and not wanting to have to wait days or weeks to return them, and they completely fell apart the second I opened them up and tried gluing the speakers back in place. And I wasn't being rough. I've fixed broken headphones before and never had them just fall apart like this. Absolute cheap garbage!

They may be nice for a few days, but they stop working quickly and are absolutely not worth the price."
843,I purchased these headphones for my kids to use with their kindle. They are super lightweight and fold up nicely to fit in the pocket of my son's bookbag. The headphones themself have an adjustable head strap to fit a child's head or adult. The headphones cover the entire ear and are very soft and comfortable. They can also be used as noise cancelling headphones if you want to drown out some loud noise or talking. Great value for the money!
844,"Really nice sound for the price of these headphones. Reasonably comfortable. A great deal! I just wanted something that I could use occasionally with my tablet when I didn't want to disturb others. I was more interested in comfort than in sound quality. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received these. Not only were they relatively comfortable for prolonged wearing sessions, but they delivered far better sound than I was anticipating. Sure, they are not 'monitor' quality, but they give a very nice listening experience with adequate bass and highs."
845,"Ear buds cause me some discomfort after wearing them for a while so I decided to try these out to see if they worked any better. All in all, I am fairly pleased with them (but I wish the bass was better so I took 1 star away). They hold sound in very well, giving the people around me peace while I can hear my music loud enough to satisfy me and my ear that has partial hearing damage. I love how they fold up so I can just toss them in my bag at the end of the day and go, no having to rearrange my life to just carry them to and fro. I'm glad I didn't pay $50 for them because, as I said, I'd like more bass but it's a pretty good product when you get it on sale. I'd recommend them if you're on a budget."
846,First- these are super comfortable. They are very lightweight and the padding feels wonderful. They are very easy to unfold. They are perfect to pack in my son's backpack for fourth grade which they require him have headphones. He loves the color. The sound is also very good and it is great at working out noise around you. I would definitely buy these headphones again !
847,"Bought from amazon since it was on sale thinking it is Bluetooth enable headphones. Sounds very good and bass on these are wow. Looks elegant and child likes it. Keeping it despite not being Bluetooth.
Definitely a good buy and stocking stuffer."
848,"Terrible. One side literally stopped working a few weeks after I received it (didn't drop it, get wet, etc.). Had to continue twisting the wire around b/c didn't have time to order a new one before my vacation. Soon after the first side stopped working, the working side left would go in and out, pause music, turn volume up/down ,etc. if the wire was gently moved/touched either on purpose or by accident. Extremely disappointing."
849,"Great sound, wonderful fabric cord, adjustable-comfortable headphones. The cord contains a button for ""pause"", but be aware there is no control on the cord for volume. I did not reduce the star rating for the lack of the volume button as I think these headphones are a great value for the money! My son is in the sound engineering business and was impressed with this buy as well!"
850,"I have not had the pleasure of being able to listen to these for long at all because our 5 year old daughter has taken them and will not let us use them...Lol! One, they are her favorite color and two (her words), they fit perfect. She brings them along where ever we go along with her IPad so she can listen to her music or play her games without having to turn down her volume or disturbing other people.

What is cool is it does have a volume control on the cord. When I got the few seconds to wear them, they sounded great and fit very comfortable on my head. For the price of $20, you cannot beat the quality of these headphones! They truly are a great buy. Thank you so much #AILIHEN for making such a great product!!!"
851,"no instructions as to what the button on the cord is supposed to do. I had to rig it for headphones to work properly. Update, already broken from brittle cord and bad switch."
852,I just received these and tested them out on Pandora with my iPhone and the sound was really good. I was impressed with the quality of the sound and how stylish the headphones were. I got the blue color and they are super cute. I think this was a good buy and I’ll be trying them out with my laptop and other devices to ensure great sound quality all across the board.
853,"Some pros for these headphones is that they have an amazing quality sound for the price and are very comfortable for the ears (except if you wear studded earrings that poke at the back). The chord is very long and can help with manuverability. It also helps that the headphones fold up and become compact, especially if you have a lot of items you are carrying in your bag.

However there are some cons. I have had these headphones for about 6 months now but sadly, only one side of the headphones work. I mainly use them to listen to music as I'm on my way to my university and as I am walking on my way to and from class. Only one side working is probably due to their everyday use and the fact that I put them in my backpack often so the chord became messed up. I recommend these headphones for at home or for low energy activities where the chord is not stressed. I do not recommend getting these if you are constantly on the go and have to stuff them in your bag."
854,"I got these headphones for my son, he loves them. I almost kept them for.mhself after trying them. The sound is crystal clear and they block out the noise in the room so he can only hear his music. Unlike some other headphones we've tried these truley have bass so it's like your listening with speakers on your stereo. He has had them for about 3 weeks using daily and had has had no issues."
855,These are a nice solid set of head phones for this price point. I often listen to music to help go to sleep and these are very comfortable and I really like the sound quality. I also use them for on-line telephone conferences with my team or when I want to have a phone conversation with someone but want to be hands free. I would certainly recommend them.
856,"I received these headphones for free in exchange for an honest review. These headphones arrived packaged wonderfully and look so sleek. They were easy to pull out, unfold, and use right away! I put them on to take out to weed my flower beds and loved them! They are noiseblocking and the bass works well. The sound is clear and loud. My husband wore them for his workout and said they had great sound. Overall, they are an awesome headset and get the job done!"
857,"Nice, compact headphone design with cans ( instead of earbud/in-ear monitors). I have own several Ailihen sound products, and just like all of the rest, these do not disappoint. When I have ever had any issues (few and far between), they have prompt, first-class sales and suppprt. They stand behind what they sell. Excellent comfort, quality sound for a great price. Five stars!!!!!"
858,"Broken after two months of light use. I think the cord is broken near the connection port. Only one side of the headphones had sound for a bit. It used to work if the cord was wiggled slightly, it's completely dead now unfortunately."
859,"I ordered three of them and only after two months passed, two of them are not functioning anymore. One of them has some connection issues on the jack; the other went silent on one side; typical for cheap products. I was expecting this brand Ailihen being better quality but it's not. I recommend to spend $50-60 and get a medium quality head phones to last at least a year."
860,This pair was a hit with my girls. They have been wanting a certain expensive pair and this one looks a lot like those. The sound quality is superb and the padding really helps to mute all of the sounds outside. There is a mic on the cord for easy handsfree calls. We got these in the gray color and are very happy with them.
861,"Gave these headphones to my husband for his birthday and he LOVES them! He uses them when riding the lawn mower so he can listen to his favorite music and they do a great job of blocking out the noise of the lawn mower, while allowing him to jam to his favorite tunes!"
862,This is one of the most amazing headphones i have noticed on relatively low price. The design and appearance is awesome. The bass is great and performed great on surround sound test. I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it as of now. The wires are threaded for durability which is missing in most expensive phones too. Good job Ailihen.
863,I am so disappointed. I might as well hung my money out of the car window. These did not work with my IPhone. Not a sound came through despite many attempts & volume adjustments. Thank goodness I bought them on a lightning deal which proved to be no deal at all.
864,"I love them and would give 4 stars save for the ""cord popping"". I only notice when it is plugged into my laptop so it's probably my laptop. I got a great promo on these headphones and it's some of the best money I've spent. The sound is comparable to more expensive headsets and they seem built to last. I love them and ended up buying 2 more pair. The cord popping is a new thing and like I said-it's probably the laptop. Buy them! You'll be happy with them!"
865,I cannot recommend these headphones. It arrived with one ear speaker loose inside the housing. It still worked so kept using. And now about a month later the other speaker stopped working...nothing else to say.
866,"These are fantastic! I purchased them as a gift for my nephew, to keep him occupied on the plane for a family vacation. When they arrived, I tried them out to make sure they were working properly, and I was blown away by the sound. Not only the highs (or treble) but also songs with bass. The sound is crisp and clean, and I couldn't have asked for more."
867,Sounded good in the beginning. A week later people were complaining they couldn't hear me. Funny thing is this headset stayed at my desk and never left the house.
868,These headphone work great and have great sound. The only bad thing about them is that they have a STRONG chemical smell for about 4 days. This prevented me from using them right away because the smell gave me a headache. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5.
869,Received 2 of these and we both love them and now I don't need to listen to the hubs YouTube videos with lots of loud machinery and he doesn't have to listen to my cooking ones .. and no more tv/computer volume wars in our happy house
870,I bought these for my teen. He said the sound quality was great but the ear padding was uncomfortable to him. He said that they didn't feel too tight just didn't care for the padding. I guess he's more of an earbud guy.
871,"These work great, they have good quality sound! They are actually pretty loud if you want it that high, my son had them off and I could hear everything clearly from the counter. They are nicely made and fold away nicely and are comfortable."
872,"Comfortable, sound is amazing. Both my kids (teenagers) love them. Bonus feature the mic. Way to often we get headphones and they don't come with a mic and many calls lost. This makes listening even more the better
Would highly recommend"
873,"I bought these for my daughter to travel with, they're soft on the ears and the sound is good. Would have given 5 stars but I haven't used it that much and sometimes these things stop working prematurely."
874,"The kids use these with the PS4 to play online with their friends. They have no issues with the quality and I don't hear the game. So far they are working well for us. As long as they last, we'll continue to be very happy."
875,"we love this headphone its awesome we recommend this headphone .
if we had known it would be this good we have bought few of them.
even though its a great product.
workmanship
quality
price
no question ask.
we thank you all."
876,"these work very well, the sound is great when using them. my kids love using them with the
Amazon Fire TV Gaming Edition, they just plug it in and mommy doesnt have to listen to them play games on the tv."
877,These are perfect for both my computer and my phone. Actually this is the second pair I bought because my son liked my first pair so much that he took them for himself. The microphone projects a clear voice and I have no complaints about the sound quality for watching movies or listening to books on tape.
878,"The ear holes are made for a child. Neither my wife nor I could get these to fit around around ears. No, we don't have Spock ears either. Never plugged them in to test the audio quality. Headphones that sit on top of your ears instead of around them were a no go for us."
879,"I love these headphones and plan to give them to my grandson for his birthday in November, if I can wait that long. Will follow up with review when he gets them. For now, they look to be made good and they sound great."
880,"These were ordered for my son, They are great! After about 10 days of use the piece broke in his ipad very unhappy. Now i need to pay for a teck to fix his ipad too. Ipset because it was a Christmas"
881,These are great headphones. Not only are they very stylish and sleek--they actually work exceptionally well! They can be broken down for more compact storage which is also a nice feature.
882,Fairly good bargain headphones. Yeah sound quality is pretty great (have yet to try the mic) but the ear cushions are rather uncomfortable if you have slightly bigger ears. Extended use definitely results in some acheing. Otherwise great for the price.
883,"I was so excited about these headphones. The sound was great i thought "" this is the best deal on headphones!"" My excitement did not last to long, after the second use i can now only hear sound from one side😢 perhaps mine were just defective?"
884,"Bought these headphones for my son, who is attending college out of our community, he loves them - the built in mic is very nice for him."
885,Comfortable. Good enough sound quality for music and when I use them with my smart phone I can hear the other person and they can hear me.
886,"These are comfortable, and fold up nice. But they mess up all of the time. When listening to music or a video it activates either the volume up/ down, or switches songs. This is without pushing the button on the wire. It will also activate the voice assistant. Very annoying."
887,"I was really hyped up for this product because of the good reviews and price of the headphones. Yet, the first day I used the headphones, I turn to get a paper, and boom, audio cuts off. Whenever you turn or move your head, the headphone's wire caused the audio to turn off or go all staticky. I was also looking for comfort when I bought the headphones, but after about two hours of it on, it gets uncomfortable. Unfortunately I'm returning the product because it's not worth the trouble. The bad outweighs the good."
888,"Amazing headphones! Easy to wear, comfortable, soundproof.. Going to get a pair for my Granddaughter! I love them! Thank you!"
889,"Works, sounds good, and inexpensive.

I'm not much of an audiophile but these headphones are pretty good for the price. Lots of bass, for those who love it. I use these to listen to white noise while I'm studying, and they do a decent job at isolating noise.

Headband out of the box is a bit tight, though I do have a big head. Ears start to hurt after an hour of listening due to compression."
890,"i purchased 3 pairs of headphones for my nephews, one gray/black, one red and one blue - so no one fights over them. they loved them!! they were great christmas gifts. everyone was happy."
891,This products sounds great. Bass is really good. I like that these fold in so they do not take up much space when not in use.
892,"Foldable, great sound, includes microphone so you can chat on phone too. Would buy again. Great and useful for a gift exchange item."
893,"While the headphones sound good, my chief complaint is that they are advertised as ""On Ear"" headphones. They are not! They are actually ""Over The Ear"" headphones with large cups/pads. Those who wear glasses shop for ""on ear"" so that the pads don't press against the glasses frame/arm that rests on the ear."
894,tThey are ok but they have a little static every once in awhile. I ordered 2 one for my husband and one for me. I didn't want to spend too much money on a set. So I got them for a great price.
895,"So far so good. I bought 2. One in red, the other in blue. The sound is AMAZING and they seem sturdy. I will update if anything changes."
896,"They lasted me for like 6 months before the right side decided to stop playing music and just only play static. i guess its true, you pay what you get. i got them on sale for 10 dollars. The sound quality was average, and you can't control the volume. Instead you get a button that answers phone calls. Just a heads up for other out there."
897,"Buy this product then.

The line of headphones is made of fabric that does not cut well.

And the It feels comfortable wearing headphones.

Don't worry about your big head. It is also possible to resize."
898,"Great headphones, and a good quality, holds up to a elementary school age child, which means a lot!"
899,"Love these headphones. Comfortable, good sound, easy to use and adjust volumes, and stores easily."
900,Shipped on time and arrived exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase.
901,These headphones are high quality & stylish. They produce a clear sound with magnified bass and cancel out noise around you. Definitely recommend these bad boys! 🎧 #jamierski
902,"Nice headphones, fit well, feel good, fold up nicely."
903,Great headphones ! My son loves it ! It fits perfectly and is adjustable. The color is very nice.
904,"Neat headphones. Should have ordered more, kids fight over these. Work well, sounds great. and folds easy."
905,Used it only 6 times over a few months and the right ear piece stopped working.
906,Had it for 4 days and it stopped working!! Used it for no more than 2 hours!
907,Quality is okay. Hurts and warms up ears after about 30-60mins
908,"These headphones is a gift for my daughter, and if she liked this, all is well, thank you"
909,I got these for my daughter and she really likes them. She said they are comfortable and work great.
910,"Glad I came across this product...great price, great sound quality. Bought it for my 17 year old daughter. No complaints."
911,They get good sound especially for the price. They're a little loose around the ears but they are a nice size and the cord is incredibly long which works out great. If I need more headphones but don't have a lot of cash this will definitely be a repurchase.
912,"The headphones work great, good quality made product, easy to use."
913,"These have good sound quality, not crisp clear like higher priced models, but pretty darn good for the price. No need to spend an arm & a leg for headphones when these do the job."
914,"The headphone comfort and the sound were good. I feel like they're a little bulky, but that's the style for some. My gripe is that they 3.55mm plug broke off inside my phone. Spent the better part of a 2 hour layover in Dallas digging into the port with a pencil to get it out. These good sounding, okay looking headphones were laid to rest in a trash can in the B terminal. Handle with care."
915,Work great in comfort and sound as they are lightweight.
916,I'm very pleased with my purchase. They are comfortable to wear and sound great.
917,"Wow! Awesome, amazing sound. Really blocks outside noise. Music tone is rich. Lucious sound. When others wear, can barely hear music playing outside of headset. Comfort is perfect on ears and head. Absolutely love the color gold. So far better then some other pairs I have for 40. Great for working out, my gardening."
918,still getting used to them ...but I like them
919,quality meets price paid.
920,Didn't last long
921,Great headphones and great price ! Sound and bass is awesome ! Recommended
922,Good clear sound BUT after using it for a while it squeezes the head.
923,Great heaphones. Hope they prove to be durable.
924,Great sound and very comfortable! This is my first purchase with this brand and I would buy it again!
925,not too sure about the volume or the ears after wearing them but they are ok.
926,"Perfect for my middle-school children. Good fit, durable material."
927,"Bought theses for my 15 year old
He loves them, rich base clear crisp sound and very comfortable, getting me a pair."
928,I received my headphones #AILIHENI60 this weekend. I am very pleased with the quality. I have two boys in my family. Both of them hace used the headphones. They are adjustable and fit perfectly. The sound quality is great and the color is amazing. The headphones pack great because the are FOLDABLE!
929,They work great
930,Good sound for the price.
931,"good sound all the buttons work like their suppose to
nothing overly fancy"
932,"filters outside noise very well, nice smooth sound."
933,I love these headphones. I needed a pair for plane travel. They are comfortable and sound good.
934,Really good headphone. Clear music sound. Strong bass. Love this.
935,"Nice headphones .. however, they worked about one week after the 30-day return date. Would not recommend, especially since they would not honor return nor replace them."
936,"I bought this headphones and it’s very cool, I like to listen to audiobooks, Now it’s my good companion in my spare time. """
937,"Sound great. They look HUGE on my sons head, but the way they fold makes them reasonable for storage. Can't speak for the mic as he doesn't use them for that."
938,These are awesome!!! My son is blessed with Down syndrome. His head & ears are smaller than others. These headphones fit him perfect!!! He can even turn his head fast & they stay put!!
939,Great thanks
940,I would not reccomend these. Within a few days the sound quality is already bad where I have to rotate the wire to be able to hear well. The connector is too long so it frequently gets hit on things
941,"These headphones work great! They have great sound quality, very affordable and lightweight! Foam ear pads are also very comfortable."
942,Blocks out all outside noise
943,These head phones are very comfortable and are noise cancelling. I like them very much. I highly recommend this product.
944,"Great Headphones. Currently one of my favorite sets. I have owned Soul by Ludacris, Beats by Dre...comparable to both and LITERALLY a fraction of the cost. Slate Grey color gives very high end appearance and ear cups are comfortable for all day use (Could be a bit larger in circumference IMO)."
945,Excellent value for the price. Good sound and noise cancelling. Super comfortable
946,One ear did not work right out of the box. I guess you really do get what you pay gor.
947,"I bought this headphones and it’s very cool, I like to listen to audiobooks, Now it’s my good companion in my spare time. """
948,Its really cool! The voice is clear and I love this color
949,So far so good. I got this for my son to use with Roku remote and sound quality is really good. I tried it on with my phone as well and sounds and works perfectly.
950,My son loves them.. They a very load and sound is perfected..
951,"Nice powerful headphones. Good bass in them, noise canceling is nice too. Wore them while quad riding and didn’t hear much of the outside noise. I like the adjustablity of them too, makes them fit my head well."
952,Great sound quality for an inexpensive product. Also love that they fold up to take up less space when not in use.
953,"Sound not bad. Got them to just throw in my bag for going to work, but not very comfortable if wearing for an extended period of time."
954,Absolute BEST gaming headset in this price range!
955,Well my so got the for Christmas and they ae now not working. I cant find the place to contact the seller
956,Lightning deal (9.99)....volume a bit low
957,These headphones work great for the price . You can answer the phone while using these
958,They where broke when I received them
959,"Right out of the box they started to cut out and now they barely work. I feel cheated. You live and you learn, learn from my mistake."
960,These headphones are AWESOME!! I seriously hate earbud headphones but these are comfortable and they sound great!! Love them so much I bought another pair!
961,"I browsed many products on Amazon before buying these headphones, I was attracted by the black-red version and the affordable price. I also want to buy a blue version for my brother."
962,"Great product, great price"
963,Super clear sound
964,Great sound and comfort!
965,Nice sound and comfortable.
966,Awesome headphones! Very comfortable..great sound!
967,It broke in 2 weeks! Not recommend it!
968,"These actually have decent bass to them, just a heads up they feel really light and plasticy so if you are looking for something with some weight to it these might not be for you."
969,"Purchased red/black and blue headphones. Red/black headphone feels really loose and keeps sliding off my head, blue one works nicely."
970,I purchased two of the headphones. They were given as gifts to my granddaughters and they absolutely loved them.
971,"I love the design! These can perfectly fit my head and are very comfortable to wear. I usually wear them on the subway to block the outside noise."""
972,Amazing...the best so far
973,they are great. Love them.
974,The headphones are very soft and comfortable. I used them to play the video games. It works amazing.
975,Great over ear headphones for the price!. Light weight and sounds great.
976,We recently purchase this an the sound is going in and out and no longer working.
977,Audio on these headphones is terrible. Starting the return.... These are low low quality audio. They are functional but awful.
978,Great price and the bass is good.
979,The sound is great especially for the price! It's also nice that they fold because my 3 year old can't break them so easily. They've held up great so far.
980,"I am very happy with this product! I was always looking for some cheap but good quality headphones. The price is premium and the quality is great. """
981,Excellent sound! Quite impressed. Definitely ordering another pair!
982,Amazing quality! Amazing sound! I've paid 3 times as much for headphones that weren't half as nice. The cord is the perfect length for when I'm on the elliptical at the gym. You've got a customer for life! Thank you!
983,"Perfect for any use. I love it, I want a regard in my next shop xD"
984,"I've been using these headphones for at least one month now, and so far so good."
985,"Decent sound. Bass is nice. would like a cleaner treble, but all in all I enjoy these headphones a lot."
986,"It arrived when expected, and works great. they fit well and are comfortable to wear. They sound great, fold up, and I love the durable cord."
987,Good sound over all this is a great product
988,Lasted one month and then the sound was no longer working on one side. Junk.
989,Very nice headphones. They exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended
990,"I love them. Originally they were for my daughter, but I use them all the time. The sound is great. I actually am getting another pair."
991,Great ear phones! I use they to talk to students over the internet that live in China! Great investment!
992,Great Headphones! Can't beat the price.
993,I like it...these headphones are great and for a good price. I would definitely recommend this product.
994,These headphone actually surprised me at how loud they were. They are some of the best headphones if owned at such a cheap price. I would definitely recommend these
995,Poor build quality One side has stopped working within 4 months.Sound quality is average.
996,They sound great and are inexspensive
997,Great sound and value. I'm pleasantly surprised with how comfortable these are and sound quality is great as well. Everything feels sturdy and well built.
998,The sound is good but the fit is pretty uncomfortable and the sound cuts out of the right side every once in a while and to fix it you have to reposition the cord.
999,I love this headphones.. Sound good and for me very comfortable.
1000,Product better than expected. Sound quality is as good as my Sony headphones.
1001,Seem to be in good condition. No problems or complaints.
1002,Works great!
1003,I am very happy with the product. It is very comfortable and has great sound quality.
1004,Very natural sound with a lot of dynamic range. Very comfortable to wear and solidly built.

Looks very nice. Thank you"
1006,Great headphones at a great price. Needed a new headphone and im glad i found these!
1007,Work like expensive headphones! Comfortable and great sound!
1008,Worked well in the beginning. I stopped being able to hear the words and I could only hear the music from a video
1009,Great headphones! A lil bit heavy on the low end but nice and clear. My drummer seems to like them
1010,Looks great but haven't used them. Yet.
1011,"Ordered a pair for my little sister's first headphones, best so far. She loved them and soon will like to order myself a pair soon!"
1012,They are comfortable and sound great!
1013,"Within 2 weeks, one of the ear pieces broke completely off when I was floding them. I was completely happy with them until they snapped."
1014,"Very comfy, love it"
1015,Good sound quality. Bought two for my daughters for school.
1016,I think that this beautiful headphone is going be great. I don't have it but I really want it.
1017,"Comfortable headphones and great at noise cancelling. If you listen to bass heavy music however, it's lacking. I saw a lot of people say it's great and while sitting in a relatively quiet bedroom, it is. However, if you use these while walking to class or on a commute to work/school, you'll find it harder to really feel and appreciate the bass in music."
1018,"Great quality for a $20 set of headphones,my only complaint would be that the cord is not removable."
1019,Not to the expectations
1020,Stop working after a month!!
1021,"I bought these for a friend, he absolutely loved them!"

1034,Perfect for children
1035,Just as advertise
