0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a headphone junky, and I got these because the price was right, the color is nice and vibrant, and I can wear them at work. They have a very long cord, so I do have to bundle it up and put a twisty tie around the bundle, but this is no big deal, rather too much cord than not enough. The sound is nice, not super great such as some of the more expensive headphones, but then again I mostly use these to listen to audio books, so the sound is just right, and they do have decent bass. If you are looking for a lightweight, nice but cost effective pair of headphones I would definitely recommend these. They do fold up nicely, too."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars," My son loves to watch movies/listen to music/play games on his tablet or one of our phones while we are travelling. The problem is, my husband and I are listening to our own music through the car speakers. So, we purchased these headphones for him so all of us could be happy travelers.

He LOVES these headphones! They are soft, padded and extremely comfortable to wear…even for longer road trips. The noise cancelling/isolating feature on these really do help tune out the outside noise around him. The fact that they can fold up and not be space hog in his travel bag is also a nice feature. It would be nice if these headphones came with a little storage bag to keep them in when not in use. The cord is covered in a very durable fabric cover which feels like it is going to stand up well to the abuse of being moved around from the house to the car, etc.

We tried the microphone out during a recent cellphone call. I could hear the person talking crystal clear…so much better than when I listen directly through my cellphone itself. Again, that is where the noise cancelling/isolating feature comes in great. I was told that I came in very clear on the receiving end, but that they could hear more external noise (probably because it has a 360° microphone) as it seemed to be very good at picking up all sounds.

I purchased this Ailihen stereo foldable headphones at a discounted price for my honest review and I am thankful that there are no more “who wants to listen to what” discussions as we are in the car travelling. For under $30 (not $20 like mentioned in the video), you are getting a quality headphone that I would say sounds and feels much better than some of the pricier ones out there."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Comfortable with good sound quality. I love the color! I have a small head, so these fit perfectly, especially because they are easily adjustable. The wire only hangs from one ear bud, so you're not annoyed by it as your're working."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love the company, INTONE, that sells these headphones. Originally, I had purchased these headphones May 31, 2016, and they proved to be defective after a month of use, as one of the headphones had detached from the handle. I contacted INTONE and attached a picture of my headphones, and the company agreed to send another pair to me. The representative told me I would receive the headphones by July 27, 2016 but I actually received them July 21, 2016!! The service INTONE provides is 5-stars!

Now, when regarding the headphones I absolutely love them, even though I received a defective pair the first go-round-- you can experience a defect with any product and/or any manufacturer/designer. The bass on these headphones is excellent and the surround sound is awesome. There is a small operating panel for the cell phone and volume on the cord-- very convenient for working out and cooking (I personally find them handy for these activities). I use these headphones for both my computer and cell phone. A great buy for the price! #AMUSTHAVE"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I have to say bad about the product is that the color of the headphones does not quite match what was pictured. They came in a darker purple, but oh well!

I use these for transcribing and I love how it helps to block out surrounding noise. Sometimes it is really hard to hear the speaker, and being able to focus on just the speaker and not the noises of everyday life is really nice.

The sound is as clear as the audio in which is was recorded on. I used another expensive brand and these are very comparable to them.

I love the cord. It is reinforced so it will not end up fraying as easily as a typical plastic coated one would. It is sturdy enough to stand up to my cats, who seem to think that the nice long cord is for them to play with."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing for the price, the bass its pretty good, received them today and they are good so far, hope the headphones last a long time and ive been using them for a while and my ears doesnt hurt, ive seen a couple of bad reviews that one of the cushions fell apart, put some super glue and fix it and other thing its some doesnt take care of the headphones properly thats why they dont last for a long time."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally I had loved these, one because of the cord that didn't tangle whatsoever (Love that part) and I loved the color and that they folded up for easy storage and whatnot. But now, I have had them for at least a month or two and as much as I wish I could love these and give five stars I simply can't because they kill my ears. This set is putting way too much pressure or something on my ears and I have to move them constantly to not be in pain which really sucks."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to headphones I always seem to have the worst luck. My headphones either break from in an extremely weird way, somehow hurt my ears, lose sound on one side or end up disappearing completely. When I saw these I was taken in by the color and specs listed. I decided to take a chance on these headphones, a chance that is definitely paying off.

They play music wonderfully. Alongside blocking outside sounds.The padding on the headphones is super soft and doesn't make your head sore from extended use. Even better is the fact the colors pictures are 100% accurate. A rarity for Amazon pictures. I'm used to some color variation or some vague disappointment. To have this surprise me in a good way was great. I'd highly recommend this headphones to more casual folks who want some sound blocking and cuteness."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far, the best kids headphones for the cost. I went through many other brands and styles before finding these.
1) They are really sturdy and durable. The nylon wrapped cord doesn't kink. There is an extended coated wire from the ear cup to the headband that allows for movement and forgives a little kids not so easy handling.

2) Seriously. You can't beat the price. These headphones are worth more for everything going they provide.

3) The ear cup is so soft and stretchy, you can wear them for long periods without pinching. They also cancel out outside sounds really well.

4) The volume is definitely fine for kids, and adults alike. Yes, you can find headphones that allow you to get sick base and blah, blah, blah.... These aren't made for that. You will, however, be able to watch movies and videos with clear and perfect pitches, highs, lows and stereo.

5) The framework is definitely sturdy and will withstand long use. Nothing about it feels chensy or cheap.

6) The mic works great. It picks up voice and delivers yours clearly and without static.

All in all, I love these. This is our second pair. We had the first for over a year with our 6-7 year old exclusively using great them. That should be an excellent recommendation in and of itself! They only broke when I accidentally caught the cord in the car door and walked away, causing the cord to separate from the mic area.

Give them a try, you won't be sorry!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These stay secure. I use them to run and for strength training. I have had no issues while working out with these. They work better than the in ear buds and do not slip off while doing hit training. 4 stars because the sound sometimes feels muffled.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Ailihen was really kind enough to replace the headphones and sent me a new pair! I am really happy with there service because they were really simple and only requested for your order ID and a picture! I am definitely adding another star for this!

Old Review:
Okay, Let me make one thing clear. This is really a top notch pair of headphones. It has amazing sound quality and will make you feel like you are in a music video sometimes. But, the durability is really not that high quality. After like about 1 and a half months of using, The Right ear-phone (The one without the wire.) Fell of for no reason. I may be at fault but I was really careful with it. It turns out the Folding had weakened the earphone's holder and it just randomly fell off. The Sound quality is still all good but it is just clumsy. Overall, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for cheap headphones that will probably last you a month with the same sound quality as Bose,Sony etc. I recommend this. And I hope that Ailihen can replace the one that just broke."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable, produce decent sound, have a reasonably long, braided cable and include a microphone and button for playback and phone control. And they're decently priced normally and were even a better deal on Prime Day. What more could you ask for?

I picked them up for my wife to listen to audio books while working, as the inexpensive headphones she had been using (which, incidentally, cost about the same as these but are far cheaper quality) were uncomfortable for her to wear for extended periods. After putting these on she immediately loved how comfortable they felt. The ear pads are surprisingly soft, considering how firm some of the less expensive leatherette headphones can be.

The cable isn't as solid as many of the reinforced, double nylon braided phone charging cables that you can buy now, but it's still nice feeling and easy to manage, and feels durable enough that you should be able to safely rely on it not easily getting pinched or weakening due to use. The included microphone and playback/call control button are a nice, unexpected feature. The button does feel slightly on the cheap side, and I wouldn't have complained if it included volume controls as well, but it still works well and is a nice bonus.

Of course, an audiophile would say that there are far better headphones, and I own a fair few of them. But for the price and value, you can't go wrong with these."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my son because I really don't want to listen to his YouTube or video game music. They work so well he no longer listens to me because he says, ""the headphones, Mom. They don't let me hear what you say, only MY stuff.""

Having a son who ignores me is a very small price to pay for an hour of coffee-drinking peace.

These do go pretty loud, so I've set noise-safety rules--I check to see that they are low enough from time to time so they won't damage his ears.

These fold up nicely, are durable, and the cord is wrapped with a woven material so it stays secure in the headphone, doesn't break, and survived one dog attack. They make my son think he's got a popular teen-brand approved headphone, but I didn't pay nearly that much in the end. These are nice."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - The sound quality is pretty fantastic for the price. The headset fits well, and the cord is longer than normal and covered in nylon. Having an extra foot of cable is wonderful, and the nylon just seems to be easier to work with and keep from getting tangled.

Cons - A few runs in the heat and and afternoon in my truck bed seems to have warped the frame beyond use. They flare out and sit around 30 degrees off my ear, creating a flap look. If I had an old school toboggan I could keep the ear pieces in place but for now the plastic has completely warped and rendered them unusable. I'll admit it's been hot lately, but that's still no excuse.

In the end If they're for inside work, your room or dorm, class, car rides, or anything in an air controlled room they're perfect. If you live down south, are suffering through a heat wave, exercise profusely, or encounter any heat beyond 80 degrees I'd recommend paying more for a better pair. In fact Sony makes a set that I used in the sauna for six months straight, and they were only ten bucks more.

Oh, and I know most people won't care but the color selection is pretty awesome. If I ever need a set for work i'll come back and buy that mint pair, they're nifty!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter to take to computer lab at school and was not looking to spend a fortune as they will be left at school. I did not have super high expectations. Got these and tested the comfort and sound quality. Now my wife wants a pair as well. The color match to the image is dead on and the sound quality and fit is terrific. I hope these will maintain that throughout the year. The folding capability is nice but having a case or carrying bag to take full advantage of this benefit would be my only suggestion. The cord is very comfortable as well as it is wrapped with a shoe lace like material. Would highly recommend this set and now have to wait for my wife to pick the color she wants.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair I've bought for my daughter. They both started out great. Very comfortable, light-weight, great sound, but then after a few weeks, the sound becomes intermittent. We are finding that there must be a short in the wire and you have to hold or manipulate the cord in a certain way and hold it in place to keep the sound coming through.
Will not purchase again and do not recommend."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!! First of all, I love the design especially since it matches my phone cover so well. I love how the jack is bent so as not to get a short when I put my phone in my pocketbook. BUT THE SPEAKERS!!!! AWESOME SOUND!! I FELT LIKE I WAS AT A SHOW AND HEARING MY SONGS IN PERSON!! They are definitely lightweight and foldable which is a plus. I would definitely recommend these headphones to EVERYBODY!! The price is great too! I've gone through so many headphones that its unbelievable!! I love these so much that I'm buying another - I saw a set that would match my outfit. :D"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am incredibly impressed. I thought that these would just be decent headphones at the price point. Considering their advertising is heavily focused on how stylish they are, I figured that's what the products highlight would be. I was so wrong.
I don't even know where to start. Besides how absolutely attractive these are, they are also comfortable. Seriously. They are so light that it's easy to forget your wearing them. They are completely padded with what feels almost like a temperpedic bed. The ear pads are soft and have a lot of give so instead of crushing your ears like most round pads they cushion them. I can wear these for hours on end without any discomfort.
The audio blew me away. Not only do these cut out so much outside noise that it's hard for me to hear myself talking while listening to anything. They also have virtually no sound leakage. The bass, treble, and all those other terms are well balanced. The music sounds right. It sounds like what I would expect from a headset of at least $60 bare minimum. I can so easily get lost in my music with these. The sound isn't grainy, or harsh. It's soft, clear and has the perfect bass level. Even for gaming these are amazing. I pick up on so many more sounds while gaming now.
I'm completely in love with these. Even if these were $60 I would still highly recommend them. I've bought a pair of sony headphones for the same price in store and if I was blindly given both of them and told the price of the sony headphones and had to guess the I35's. I would assume these were at least $60 but more likely to be $80+. A fantastic product that I wish I could give 10 stars to. I've already talked a friend into buying a pair.

Extremely highly recommend."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had it for about a month now and everything works just fine. It will change tracks on your smart phone, meaning music by pushing the button on the microphone. The telephone side of the works excellent as well. It fits very well over the head and is very comfortable. The only small drawback is is a little bit lacking in bass, but I guess that's to be expected for the price. I really wanted something that would change my musical tracks without having to take my smart phone out of my pocket and was also very comfortable. I would say that this is a very nice unit for traveling outdoors and going places. If you're looking for something just to listen to music to at home, I would recommend a more powerful bass response headphone system. But everything works and messy important thing. You push the button twice no changes to the next track, whether you have a your system on shuffle or you are playing an entire album. So everything works fine."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these so that I can listen to audible books, music and watch streaming video on my devices without disturbing my husband. LOVE them! They are comfortable to wear, adjust easily and the sound quality is superb! I am thinking I will buy another one so that I can have one in the living room AND one in the bedroom. They easily fold up when not in use. Not only are they comfortable, they're stylish. SO many colors to choose from. I definitely recommend."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight is what I wanted. I want to listen to news radio on my way to and from work. My Sony piece is great but it is a bit heavy on my standard. The ear cupping is not as comfy as my Sony. It is a bit small and tight. The exterior starts showing wear and tear. I guess it is because I always leave it in my backpack scratching with other items when it is not on my head. I have no complain about sound quality (for just listening to news radio?).It has being traveling with my ever since the day I received it.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, the PLASTIC pins holding the speakers to the headband broke within three months of purchase, simply due to normal use. Completely dissatisfied. I won't be ordering these again...."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,CHEAP!!! You get what you pay for!!! The foam ear piece covers came off after the first use. There is no way to reattach them. My son wont wear them as one has the foam ear piece and the other doesnt. DONT BUY
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought these in March of 2016 for use at work because I don't like having ear buds embedded in my ear for the long conference calls I sometimes have to take. The ear buds get uncomfortable after awhile. So the first pair I bought, I inadvertantly broke myself while working out. Unfortunately, after some months of use on the second set, the female part of assembly that allows the left ear piece to flex has now broken (Chipped Away), not through rough use or damage, but through regular use. The pin that inserts into the assembly will no longer stay in position, leaving the left ear piece dangling. The Audio quality was good both send and receive and they were comfortable. I liked these, and for the price they work, but this is the second set I've gone through in 6 months. I will be trying a different set next time."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Could easily be a 5 star product for others, but I had to deduct a star as it puts a lot of pressure on your ears making it harder to wear for more than 3 hours at a time, and I bought these for use at my home computer.

But for the price, they are very good headphones and deliver nice sound quality, while allowing you to still hear others. I live with my grandparents and so it's important that I hear them if they yell up to me from downstairs."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones for listening to music, recording vocals, and mixing my vocals. They're very good quality and the headphones are so pretty! I ordered mine in light blue+purple and I just love the color. I don't have anything to complain about in terms of quality- I've only had a few pairs of headphones over the course of my life but these are the best-quality ones I have yet.

I've had them for almost a year and they haven't broken like some other customers have complained about. The only complaint I have is they hurt my ears after a while, but for only $20 what can you expect? I probably won't buy them again as I'm planning on upgrading all my equipment, but I'd definitely recommend these."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only have had these for a few weeks and the ear cushion has already fallen off. Very unhappy with this product and my daughter was extremely disappointed.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst ever!! Padding for the ears constantly falls off and kid has a meltdown in the middle of traffic.. I pull over to continually fix the ear pads and I have a meltdown. Exposed wiring from headset to earpieces have begun to wear and break. Find something else!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic headphones for children. We now have three different ones for my three children (ages 7-10 years old) and they are sturdy, reliable, easy to clean, and have fantastic sound. I am so happy with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to others seeking quality headphones at a great price."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these a little over a month, and I only use them a few times a week. Yesterday, they broke...the cushion around the ears came apart off the headphone. I don't know how to fix it. These were purchased on 1/17/17, and I feel they should of lasted longer. Unfortunate because I really liked these."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wire controls are flimsy and broke but headphones still work. My daughter uses them everyday in school still.

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones!!! I love them so much I bought 2 other pairs for my brothers. They come in fun colors and are easily adjustable to your head. The ear phone parts are a tad bit small, they cover girls ears all the way, but may be a little small on the guy side. Great size for kids !!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones for my daughter. I really like that they used a threaded material cover for the wire it holds up to a lot more of the daily wear and tear. I have gone through a lot of headphones this year for my ten year old daughter and find the Ailihen headphone to be the best one I purchased. Sounds great, durable and rugged and very comfortable."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am sending them back as you could not adjust the sound easily. I ordered another brand and am very happy with them.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones for my son. Uses them for computer gaming as well as listening to videos on his phone and/or tablet. He finds them comfortable and have great sound. Very happy with the purchase.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"cute, comfortable, okay sound quality...BUT you can HEAR THE MUSIC FROM ACROSS THE ROOM through the headphones. Can hear the music as clearly from 10 feet away from the person wearing them and playing music, than as actually wearing the headphones. Would not recommend unless you plan to use them on a very low volume."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great until they broke
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and terrific value. I actually went back and ordered a pair for my wife :)

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,GOod headphones. Worked well in plane. Kid likes them.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't last long. Broke in couple of months. Ear muffs sit on your ear not around therefore your ears will hurt after few minutes
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter received these for her 8th birthday to plug into her Kindle Fire and she absolutely loves them. They have amazing sound and they fit her perfectly. She has a rather small head but they adjust very well. We love them!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones itself seems like great quality-- it's super cute and the sound quality was perfect. However, I think something is wrong with the pair I received. I gave it to my sister as a gift today for Christmas so she could use it while playing her new piano. However, when she took the headphones off after a few minutes of use, the ear piece (the cushion part-- I don't know how else to explain it) came off of one side. I tried to crazy glue it back together but I don't know how helpful that will be. Attached is a photo, the right side (where you see the black part) is the piece that fell off. I was excited for this product because of the great reviews it received, but now my sister and I are just disappointed."

The bass is great, the balance is amazing, and they are so cozy! I'd recommend these to anyone looking at them. A perfect buy for a good price."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the Price theses are amazing headphones. they are lightweight yet durable. I wanted to make sure the cord was sturdy enough being that I have young children who destroy everything1 to my surprise the cord is great! Sound is good quality as well and i have already used the microphone for powerpoint presentation.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these cuts out noise extremely well and have had no problems with the mic. Great purchase
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headset. Good sound. Long cable.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great!

The volume switch on the cords came apart but I found the piece and glued it together and it worked fine. They're overall very sturdy and I love the color."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,good value
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones work amazingly great. Great noise cancellation. After awhile the headphones broke after taking the off my head. They don't fold anymore but with some super glue they we're good as new. They're like regular headphones now. They don't fold anymore. :/
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product very compatible and clear
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They were decent. Got the job done, but just be careful how you handle them so as not to break!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These won't fit over the ears of a child, let alone me."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I should have paid more attention to all the reviews that said these were being used by a teen. These are okay but after several uses I passed them onto a teen as well. They aren't noise cancelling and they never fit my adult head and habits that well. On the other hand the teen lives them. Great color though.

Months later: Ailihen just contacted me based on my review to see if another product would be a better fit. I think this is an excellent example of great customer attentiveness. Bravo, Ailihen!

Okay, I got the new ones--the gold ones Ailihen recommended. I've been using them fo months. Verdict? I so appreciate Ailihen's intervention. When I travel, they go with me. A four-hour layover in Seattle Airport TWICE led to extensive use of my headphones. Comfortable and effective. Great sound AND I heard the boarding announcement. Kudos to my headphones and Ailihen.

Please know I got the second pair free and that's all. The previous pair for which I paid and passed on to a friend are still being used and enjoyed. I did right and so did Ailihen."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I first ordered a mint pair and they were comfortable and worked great for my daughter. I then ordered a pink/black pair and this pair is defective. While plugged into the same device it will randomly adjust the volume when the cord is slightly moved or activate S voice. The mint pair does not have these problems. Returning one and keeping one.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super cute color! Much better than I expected. Child size and my nephew love it so much, it’s totally the child color and make him looks so lively."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,super cute and the quality is super awesome
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent. High quality, foldable and lightweight. Ideal for public transport."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They fit my 5-year-old and me both. They are super soft in the headphone pads too. I really like them.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone is good except it has one problem... The left side of the headphone doesn't work but the right side does. Is it supposed to be like this? (Btw I got black/orange)
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of sound wasn't that good for me.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Piece of junk! Didn't even last 3 months! Don't waste your money! The sound and fit were good but with minimal use the connection cut out. There is no visible wear on the cords.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,The pause/volume button on the cord is broken and it says the item can't be exchanged!!!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 3. All three were broken at the part where the unit goes into the computer within a few months. Needs a super rigid protecting something right there, so it doesnt' bend back and forth. Won't get again."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. These are very visually appealing, and I love love love the fact that they are only connected to a cord on one side. I always get tangled up with normal ones, and just hate that feeling of a cold cord across my collarbone.
They are pretty comfortable, easy to adjust, the sound quality is good, and they do a pretty good job with noise-cancelling (not total silence, but pretty quiet)."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headset works beautifully with iPhone and Droid cell phones. I'm impressed with the noise-cancelling quality of the headphones. I barely hear anyone speaking to me. I ordered the aqua and purple set and love the colors. The head set is adjustable and comfortable on the head. The ear covers are soft and cushioned which makes them very comfortable for extended wear.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are hardly ever used by my son. We've had them 3 months and they've been used maybe 3 times. My son was sitting on his iPad with these things on, when this wire slips right on out! There was no pulling or tugging. I watched it fall effortlessly out. Such a shame! I'm past my return window so I'm out the $20. Very bummed about this and my 3 year old is sad we can't use this on our 7 hour car trip this weekend :("
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great... for 3 months. I purchased theses headphones a while ago and they broke after 3 months. The company gave me a replacement and another 5 months they broke... AGAIN. The earpiece broke off and they keep pulling up Siri without me wanting to. Since they were ""out of warranty"" they aren't sending me new ones or giving me some refund. Don't buy these unless you want them runiend."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound quality for the price, nothing to brag about. My nephew complained they were a little tight on his head causing headaches, and he is only 13. They also broke around the ear cushion hinge opposite to the corded side after about 2-3 months of use. At about 4 months of having them, they are almost completely falling about, being held together by a menagerie of tape and glue. And this is a 13-year old that panics if anyone even breathes too hard near his electronics, he isn't exactly being rough with them. Really sad that his younger brother's dollar store generic rip-off brand headphones have lasted three times as long as these with the exact same quality and features."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for a long road trip. First appearance when opening these box was these are very good quality. I purchased the aqua and purple set and the color is spot on match. They fit my 4 year old well and are very soft on her ears. These will also fit an older child as they seem flexible. The cord is long so it can reach a device further away which is a plus for us. She can sit back from the DVD player in our SUV and the cord reaches with ease. The sound quality is good she has no issues hearing over road noise. This was a good purchase.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even had the item more then 1 month. And it broke. The left ear piece is broken. Have them as a Christmas present and now I have to buy or get different ones
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly recommend Ailihen I35 lightweight folding headphones! Both our 4 year old daughter and we love these headphones. Comfortable and size appropriate for her to wear, with ample room to grow!
Only thing lacking is volume control, but I chose not spend an outrageous amount of money in case she lost or broke them immediately."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome. They fit great and i can listen to my audio books while i work out without struggling with ear buds.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The color are super cute! The headphones have good sound quality however the jack keeps giving me a problem. The jack needs to be placed in correctly if it the headphones don't work.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These should be classified as children's headphones. They are not large enough for an adult woman to use. They push on your ears and hurt after wearing them for an hour. That said, for the price the sound quality is just fine."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,they have survived 3rd grade so far
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome bass!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price!! Comfortable..
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They look really cute, but the microphone creates a lot of static for the person you're talking to. The size of the earphone is oddly shaped so after a while it creates too much pressure on your ears and becomes uncomfortable."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a great set of headphones! Even on the lowest level the sound is clear and crisp. The colors are lovely too. I just might buy one in every color. Would definitely recommend.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , the touch is very good. My kid liked it so much."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's soft and the sound is pretty gorgeous ❤️❤️
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great. Headphones are more comfortable than earbuds and block surrounding noise attributed to cubicle farm office setting. Glad I bought them! Wasted too much money on earbuds that were uncomfortable, did not last long, and did not block unwanted noise. Recommend this product to others."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my teenage granddaughter. So far they are working well and she is happy with them.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones for my granddaughter to use with her new iPad, she seems to.be enjoying them!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and performance. I bought the for my teenage daughter who lost a pair of $100 Beats headphone she received at Christmas. I have to say she is just as happy with the performance of these headphones as she was with the Beats. Good job!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our 3 year old grand baby loves these! She can watch movies, or play on
her IPad, in the car, without disturbing everyone else. They are soft pleather
and are very comfortable on her ears. Still in perfect condition after almost
a year!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 2 of these headphones for my girls and they liked the fit and color of these headphones but they only lasted a couple months before they both stopped working. Very disappointing!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Colors are perfect - our 9 year old loves these. Says they feel comfortable on her head - not too tight or too loose!
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them!

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This foldable headphones were bought by my 12-year-old daughter and she was very happy with the sound, the softness of the sponges that cover the headphones.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, I recently purchased these for a nine hour flight to London... besides being very light and super soft the sound is fabulous and so clear. The color is beautiful and I recommend this product highly. They are far superior to other more expensive earphones I've purchased in the past. And, they fold to fit into small spaces."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones!!! Bought these for my six year old daughter and she loves them!! Great quality and looks good too!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivered on time and product was as described. Excellent sound and comfort. The problem is that they're so good that my grandson grabbed them and won't release him because i
his action games sound so much better than the headset he was using."

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They match my PJs. (Most important fact)
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,what I was looking for
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good for the price. Kid needed them for school this upcoming year. Sound was a little off, but not enough to return them."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I make minimal use of headphones, and these are just perfect for my needs. The sound is crisp and clear for music and for calls. I also like the different bright colors from which to choose. I highly recommend these if you want good quality but don't want to spend an arm and a leg."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones are very comfortable and high quality. The cord is not just plastic and has a cloth cover so it does not bunch up or twist easily. This is the second pair I have purchased.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Super nice and comfy earphones, but the cord broke the first month. What a waste."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well but broke easily. Wish they made them stronger. Now have to buy something else.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these headphones, she uses them at school for computer lab. They travel well and are durable."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased 2 one for each grandchild. They Love them for their iPads. I restricted the volume on the iPad and they really enjoy watching movies and playing games quietly.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. ..!!!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice. Decent sound quality. If I had one complaint is that even when fully extended, there is a lot of pressure on ears. Ask several people and the small headache they have seems to go away after removal. Granted this takes upwards of 2 hours to occur. Overall 4/5 stars."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headset for walking.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones seem sturdy, the color is nice, as is the sound. However, they hurt my ears so much I cannot wear them."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Falling apart in less than a month! Would not recommend.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent!!!! I use them at work every day, and after a bit of wearing them in, they fit my head comfortably. These puppies have the amazing capability to make it so I don't have to listen to my co-workers' constant whining. Definitely worth the money."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cute and work very well!!! I like that the cord is a small rope and not a wire. Clever.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,It will be good if there is volume control buttons. And the button for answering call/ play is very small. It can be little bigger. Otherwise the product is very good. Good quality sound. Light weight. Colorful
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them for my 7 yr old girl and she used them 3 times and the padding on the ear just fell off completely from the head set. Very disappointed. Didn't last 3 weeks!!!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair and decided that my granddaughter needed one also, she was excited with the color one choose for her."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good considering the price. The cord itself was way longer than I thought it would be, but that's the only inconvenience I've come across in the week I've been using them. I look forward to using them for a long time"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter enjoying them.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Gets very dirty quickly and hurts my ears

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased in March, lasted till July. After that the sound was weird. Most songs had no vocalist, or very quiet. All my daughter's music is instrumental now, LOL."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ear cushions came off after 30 or so uses. Used by my kids so they gave them a workout. Sounds good and still work but uncomfortable without the cushions. Tried gluing them back on without any luck.

Heck, I've even """"borrowed"""" them to watch movies on my Kindle Fire, when I wanted to be able to privately watch a show that was rated R, and didn't want everyone around me to be able to hear.
I highly recommend these as inexpensive, comfortable headphones!"""
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The audio isn't the greatest but the headphones are lightweight and work for playing xboxlive which is a plus. You honestly get a better product than when you pay for.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great. My only reservation is that I wish the ear pieces were bigger because I like the feeling that it's covering my whole ear, and also wish I could angle them slightly more flush to my ear. But probably for most people these things would not be a problem. Overall, very good product especially for the price."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The inside product box arrived unsealed with the ear covers off. I had to wait for my spouse to get home to put them on so I could try them out. At least we had a good chuckle about that!

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item was returned for refund due to the product not working on the computer. To listen to the sound in stereo we had to constantly hold down the Mic button.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,fast shipping and they work great. sound is crisp and loud with the expandable ear pieces fitting very nicely. quality is also very good and the first thing I noticed was the cord its heavy duty. for the money these work very well and i'd recommend buying as a cheap sub for those pricy brands
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,We had 2 pair for movies in the car on the go and have been happy so far. My kids are 7 and 5 and they work well for them. My 5 year old needed a headset for school so I got another set a different color. The covered cord is helpful in keeping it less tangled. They are pretty good quality because my kids are the ones who take care of them and they are still alive.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of these headphones in this household. My daughter has a purple and pink pair and my son really liked them so I just ordered them in orange and black for his birthday. Both are really nice looking and very durable.
They are comfortable and easily adjustable and I like how they fold. The sound is surprisingly great for the price, I know because I've actually worn them myself.
Highly recommended!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is on the small side, like others mentioned. Which works perfectly for us

He goes through headphones like crazy. Lets see how long these last."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect headphones for my 9 year-old. She loves the colors and the softness of them. I can also hear them when she puts the volume too loud so it is a good situation for both of us. The ear pieces are soft for her and do not hurt her ears, although the headphones themselves are just a tad too big...they don't adjust to the size of her small skull just yet, but she can still wear them alright. :-)"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are worth more than $20. Fits my ear comfortably and bass is pretty good considering the price. I absolutely love the fabric cord. A friend of mine said she broke another pair of cheap headphones, which she frequently does. So, recommended these to a her. She is excited about them as well. These are truly a jem. Don't pass these up!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great for about six months but now stop working, i only got sound from one side then eventually it stop all together looks like problem with wire cable eventually degrading after use over time. Also the cushion on the ear piece came off in a month after using i had super glued it back on. Now time to look for another head phone 😐"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are even better than I imagined, even cuter too! Got them for my junior yr of college because my old headphones broke and these work like a charm. Also the mic on the cord makes my voice so much clearer when I'm talking on the phone with my boyfriend, he also complimented them and said I sounded so much louder and clear! Plus they send you a discount on any future purchases, which I might use for a family member or even myself if necessary. Great product!"

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones!

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend this product for a kid who's likely to break it as soon as they get it. So maybe it wont hurt as much. It appears cheaply made and sound quality is only average. You get what you pay for.

I was nervous that there would be extra weight with these headphones, but that isn't the case. They are very light for being corded. My daughter really enjoys the sound quality, which obviously is the most important thing.
The cushioned areas are extremely soft. This is a very comfortable set, and that's a selling point because my daughter watches videos for hours.
But, my! Are they ever pretty! Honestly, the aesthetics of this set has garnered her many a compliment, and for the price I paid, I couldn't be happier. Great product."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality but I was hoping for them to be a little louder. Very good sound none the less.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were a Christmas gift. My daughter used them for 2 days and the ear pad fell completely off. Because I ordered it in October I was unable to return them. Very dissatisfied.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were really nice until the cord snagged on the computer chair one day. It didn't get tugged hard, but now they sound is intermittent. Nothing looks loose, but if I move the cord around I can cause the sound to go in and out. So ok for the price, but aren't very durable."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,After owning for one month the headphone jack broke off and now we can't use them. In addition the ear pad came loose
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have placed an order for these headphones 3 times, the last 2 for other people. I love them and everybody else seems to as well.
They're incredibly cute and pretty well-made for the price and I've found the sound to be good and sufficient for the average user. Highly recommed and I'm pretty sure I'll order again for somebody else.
They do have ONE drawback, and I've seen other reviewers mentions this - they can kinda hurt, specially if you're not used to wearing this style of headphones.
I solved this issue by stretching then out on the actual box they came in while I was not wearing them. After a while, good to go."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have a family member in long term care facility and needed something easy to operate. I thought it had volume control but it has a mic that I didn't need. I finally got the DVD player today and I tried out the headset and it was very good for the price. can't go wrong. not for a grown man because the ear pads a tad small. better for kids and gals. just what I needed
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Granddaughter 9th birthday present. She asked for ""The Color Purple,' headphones. Good sound, fine construction and very comfortable at a fantastic price ... and I'm an audiophile. Had to get a 2nd one after one of the headphone pad attachments came off. Amazon to the rescue. Dod not need to return the failed item. They simply credited my CC account 100%. I repurchased another. Good product even though....."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones, and it has a high volume output. I like the covered cable and it's virtually impossible for the cord to tangle unless you do it on purpose, the only thing is that after wearing them for some time my right ear starts hurting, I don't think the shape of the muffs agree with that ear for some reason. I've tried adjusting the position on my ear but it still ends up hurting. Good quality for the price though"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. I saw some conflicting reviews. A lot of reviews said that these were for children. I decided to get them anyway since I am on the small side (adult woman). They fit me great. My husband put them on and they fit him alright too. The sound quality is pretty decent. They do a good job canceling outside sound as well. I like that you can push the button to pause and skip to the next song or video.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Right out of the package these are my 4 years old's favorite new headphones, which is what I was hoping for. I like to not have to hear her iPad, and be able to watch my show while being in the same room as her. The headphones fit my adult size head as well and they are comfortable with good sound quality."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good enough, but first week, one ear pad fell off. Then after a couple more weeks, the other ear pad fell off. I had already discarded the packaging, so I couldn't return. Impossible to get the pads back on. Yesterday, I walked in and found my daughter taping the pads back on with black electrical tape. These are garbage.

*****UPDATE***** After my negative review of the product, the seller contacted me and offered a replacement. They did send a replacement and I am very happy with their customer service. So, while I don't know how long the replacement will last, the seller is EXCELLENT! So, you can have confidence buying products from this seller, they will help you if anything goes wrong with your product. Thank you very much!!"

I guess I shouldn’t have had high hopes with the price of these. I wouldn’t recommend.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones for the gym and I've been wearing them for a couple weeks now and am not disappointed!

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. I got the bright color so I could find them in the dark.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for price, color and comfort. The head band is extremely soft as are the ear muffs. The sound is decent quality and these do block out outside noise when the volume is turned up. The color is vivid. Any purple fan will love it."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones! They're so soft and the colour is beautiful. The only problem is that they hurt my ears after a while but that's probably because I have glasses.

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cloth on headphone pulled away. Very hard to put back. Needs to be better. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars

Hope it lasts!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have good sound. Probably not for somebody looking for anything super high-quality, but they're good for the basic music listener. They muffle sound, but don't completely sound-proof your surroundings. After wearing them for an hour or so, my ears start to hurt, but they're definitely better than earbuds."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, snug fit. Choice of colors and easy to store. I would buy these again! Makes a great gift."

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it to my brother, he said it works perfectly but it doesn't has a bass booster."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received these in the mail today and I am so happy. The color is great and they are super soft and comfy. My head is a bit small and they fit me perfectly without needing to be adjusted. I watched videos and played a game with them and the sound is great, in fact I turned my volume down a bit from where it normally is. So far they seem well put together. I look forward to testing these out a bit more and testing out the microphone as well. 10/10 would recommend."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't last 30 days. I bought this for my son for Christmas, and about 20 days after him using it every day it just stopped working. we tried different phones/MP3 players, but none of them could 'see' it when it was plugged in. Would not buy again."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great and clear sound, cute color, craftsmanship seems good and sturdy. But no volume adjustment, you need to adjust volume on player. Just hope it'll last long. For the past year, I've bought several headphones from other brands (including brand names) but they broke within weeks/months and didn't last a year."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound and comfortable fit for the price. I bought 2 of these for my kids and was quite surprised at the quality of them. Usually $20 gets you something slightly above junk, but these sound good and are very comfortable. The other reviews were all pretty positive and this was definitely the experience I had with them. For the price they are definitely 5/5 stars, but if you're looking for a high-end sound then this is not it. The kids love them though."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones! The color is super cute though they're definitely more mint/turquoise than light blue. For the price, these are pretty great. The sound quality is nice and rich, the cord is sturdy and much longer than I expected it to be, and they're extremely comfortable to wear for a long time. I've only owned them for a couple of weeks, but so far these are probably the best headphones I've ever had. If your the sort to take care of your things like I am, I can see these lasting a decent while."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loved these headphones! Loved them! They fit well. They canceled noise. They kept me from having to hear videos about Minecraft. I purchased at the end of May, and by the end of June, they were already broken. The pin holding them at the folding part came out and I tried to fix it, but it would never fit just right. He kept using them, even with the duck tape holding the left side together. Today, the right side pin came out. Sadly, I am looking for another pair."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This AILIHEN Stereo headphone is fantastic. It was well made and has a good surround background feature when listening to music.It's too good for such a low price. It comes with another 20% coupon discount off for the purchase of any Ailihen products plus one year warranty of this headphone. This manufacturer have the love of God in him. I recommend this product.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We needed a new set of headphones for my daughter. These are a favorite color of hers, they feel soft and of a good quality. They don't have the strongest bass thumping abilities, but for the price point, they provide a good, rich sound. There is even decent noise isolation, not for the listener from the environment, but at moderate music levels, no sound bleeds out to the environment."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, good sound, but poor construction. The braiding around the wire is what initially sold me cause it tends to be a pinch point that is first to short out on cheaper headsets. The inline controls for audio play with my Galaxy 6S are very convenient. However, the plastic bracket/hinge holding the ear-muff to the headband seemed to be the poorly designed pinch point for this device. It worked great for a couple months then snapped while wearing. They never received any stress so I found it odd that it snapped like it did. Perhaps defected from the get-go. Regardless, they are totally worth purchasing again and I would recommend them for watching movies on a laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones seemed fine, but 6 weeks in the metal jack that is used to connect the headphones to a device just snapped off. Can't use the product and the return window closed after just one month!"

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair we purchased for our 6 yo (she lost the 1st pair). She loves the color combos, they are great headphones for kids."

She's been using them for 2 months now.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves the headphones. Seems to be good quality and nice that they fold up which is handy. Also like that the cord is wrap with string which protects is better I think. Happy with this purchase.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"By no means the best headphones I have ever owned, but they suit my perposes. I dont listen to a lot of music, but I watch videos. YouTube, Netflix etc. They work well enough with my tablet for that."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones. I bought them for the sole purpose of using them for my piano class. Something I noticed is when I plug them into the piano they make a static noise and one of the ears softens a bit. They work perfectly fine with my laptop.

Another thing I have noticed is after a little while my ears start to hurt a little. I think the phones are little small so that is something to watch out for.

I think there is supposed to be a microphone. I haven't used it yet and am not really sure how it works. The box and instructions were in a different language."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality and works for a 9 year old. Only problem is the material covering the ear piece kept coming off. Nothing a little super glue didn't fix. Other than that could have gotten 5 stars.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter has it and it lasts longer which is perfect for her and she loves it too 😍😸🖒

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,While the are a little small and the sound is muffled a little bit; I adore these headphones. I especially like the cord that is wrapped in fabric material rather than just plastic.

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,my son is very happy with his headsets
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are toast one month after purchase. These are nice looking headphones and seem like they should be durable. I chose them because the matched my kindle case and also because after so many dead headphones due to shorts, these have a nice insulated cable.Alas they didn't short out but instead the headband where the speaker connects broke.

I should also mention that they were always uncomfortable for my adult size head so maybe these are for kids. So to sum up, mine are broken, they were too tight on my ears and they are cute and solid looking if not well constructed in reality. So buy at your own risk. I now will invest in a more expensive pair. I hesitate to do so only because I've gone through so many earbuds and headphones this year. Can't anybody make a durable and reliable headphone/earphone that does't break or short out within a few months?"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My step-son loved these! Also bought a pair for my daughter & niece and they loved them as well. I was told they're stylish & super comfy.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Audio quality is decent. Ear cushion came off and not easy to reattach.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset was okay as far as comfort and sound quality are concerned, but the attachment of the earpiece to the headband is poorly designed. Mine broke after less than 3 months of light use, and cannot be repaired. I got mine with a $4.00 promotional discount, so $5/month for a disposable item is not too bad. I'm now going to try the Amazon Basics model AmazonBasics Lightweight On-Ear Headphones - Black, and gladly say goodbye to the horrible orange color!

Follow-up. Alihen monitors their customer reviews. When they read mine, despite the fact that the headset was beyond the return period, they promptly sent me a brand new replacement headset. You can't ask for better Customer Service than that!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones for my 11 year old and she loves them. The light blue color is exactly as pictured. She said it sounds great and loves the color. For the price, you really can't beat it."

Update:

The seller sent us brand new headphones for free, they do have great customer service so now we will see how these do as far as holding up. Upping to 3 stars and more later if this pair holds together!!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound! Sturdy and comfortable. I really like that the cord is thicker than what is normally found on lightweight headphones; it doesn't tangle easily. They seem better suited to smaller heads, but then, every head is smaller than mine. These were for my daughter, though, who's coconut is pretty normal size. I'd recommend these headphones."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 11yo daughter to use with a Chromebook. She loved the colors and wanted to use them for video chat with her friends.

I also tested them with my ps4. I played a few games and no one complained about my mic. They said I sound good. This gave me pretty good stereo sound and I wouldn't mind grabbing a pair to use as my permanent headphones for gaming.

I didn't get to test with music but, I like a little more bass than this putout.

For $20 you cant really give these a bad review."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones. I have used these for over a week, and they have excellent fidelity. I wanted a good set of headphones for my new laptop (it has the 3.5 mm plug), and this was definitely a good choice. Very reasonably priced and comfortable to wear."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a teacher and recently ordered 50 pairs of Ailihen I35 Stereo Lightweight Foldable Headphones. Even though I have only unpacked 3 pair so far, the kids that used those three were very pleased. They loved how soft they felt on their ears and were very excited for the sound and volume the headphones projected. The color is a win for both girls and boys. As the teacher I love that they are foldable and compact. Thank you again for a great product and fingers crossed, the other 47 will be just as great!!!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Adjustable set. I went for the black/orange color.
I was really concerned if they would be adequate for my needs-
to tune out the world, to BANG (good bass), and work with my laptop.
So far, it does all three!
So the sound quality gave me more than i was expecting from headphones
at this price. Cord is like a braided hose, so shouldnt kink on you.
The button on the cord does pair with my iphone 7+, so im sure it will work
to answer or make google requests."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a Christmas present for my adult daughter, who specifically picked these out after much research. The headphones are very nice and appear as they do in the picture. The quality is very good with a sturdy cord and they are comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and I would definitely purchase another pair for myself or others. Thank you for the quick delivery."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 11 y/o daughter. She loves the sound and how well they minimize background noise (not noise cancelling - but quiet). She also wears them for hours on end - so comfort is presumed! Finally, she loves the color scheme.

I would recommend. Great product at a great price!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted the ear pads big enough to cover my ears. They are too small and instead sit ON the ear and that makes your ears sore; Sent them back and will look elsewhere. If you have small ears or are a kid they may work. Seem ot be made well..just not for me.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very good, they fit well and have a great sound. I use them on my PC to listen to music and to play games, the cord is long enough that I don’t have to be right up close, so I would give them a 41/2 out of 5 stars for that.
Now why I am writing this review, one day the folding pin broke on the ear piece. I made contact with the company and explained the problem, the company wrote me back, they were very pro-active, they asked me to send pics of the headphone, I did, then they suggested to me that they would offer me a new replacement headphone. Customer service for AILIHEN is 10 out of 10"

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The material is comfortable, I love the fact that the chord feels like a shoe lace, so it's easier to wrap up and won't break.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks good, but not comfortable. after a little use, ears start hurting. and the actual headphones broke off the strap that goes around your head. so they are just dangling around. pretty useless now"

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked ""OK"" for 4 months but now they are broken. The wires shorted out. Do not expect to be able to wear these for a long time. They are not very comfortable and hurt your ears because the ear covers are way too small. To not get if you have peircings. They begin looking dirty really fast too. Are a great color though."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted an upgrade from the ear buds that came with my phone but these were about the same quality . Not bad but definitely not higher end than what I already have . Basically a waste of cash .

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price and brand name being so obscure, it's a fantastic headset. The bass isn't too bad, but doesn't compromise high tones for it. My only complaint is the cord is a bit shorter than I'd like."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"To me, the sound was so low and muffled. Just awful.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came on time / as described
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones worked well for the first week or so that I used them, but soon afterwards started to cause problems. Whenever the cord is bent or moved, it causes the music I'm listening to to either skip, stop, or fast forward (in some cases, it also activates Siri as well). Would not recommend these headphones."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my daughters and they love them. Light weight but sturdy and the cord is very nice. Vibrant colors make them fun.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! Great price. works with my laptop, phone and huzzy uses it on his ps4 mic works well to. It's light and soft."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones didn't sit straight, put a lot of pressure on one ear more than the other. Uncomfortable. Ended up giving them to my 9yr old, she hasn't complained yet."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven't actually tried the sound yet but these are really comfortable and stylish for my 8 year old son. He can definitely fit in these for a few more years.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality and good fit. Also, quick and friendly customer service; I was confused about the warranty and they got back to me the same day, assuring me that it comes with a one year guarantee. Perfect!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so happy I purchased these headphones. I can't use buds and I need a set of reasonably priced headphones that worked well. These are perfect. Long cord is another plus.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're cool... Bought em for my son for school. He likes em', so... I like em."

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones. Loud and fun in color
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,At such an affordable price I was afraid these might be of lesser quality but they sound great and I love the unique color combos!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these to tune out people in the car, and to accept phone calls while listening to music without accidentally jerking out the ear pieces. Theyre gorgeous and fold, and the cord is covered in cloth similar to paracord to prevent damage. If yiu wear them around your neck they actually function as a mini speaker. I plan to purchase another pair as well."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice set of headphones for the money. Lightweight, build is far better than what I've seen on phones twice the price. I use them when I go for walks at the dog park so not really wanting to bring an expensive heavy and bulky set with me. I am not a fan of earbuds. I've never had a set that sounded any good and they make my ears hurt. I like to hear the music like it's supposed to be heard - comfortably!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Tight around the ears somewhat, but the sound quality is good. If your buying this for a child then it would probably be a great buy. For an adult the cushion around the ears flattens your ears back, can't wear more than an hour at a time, not great when you want to watch a movie on your laptop when the children are asleep."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t had these a year, and the cord is messed up. It crackles/loses a channel if the cord isn’t positioned absolutely perfectly; this has worsened over time so that they are unuseable. They were cheap so I got what I paid for. Before that, had surprisingly decent bass for the price."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones arrived today and I couldn't be happier. The sound quality is amazing for the price and there is even a bit of extra bass boost, which I personally like a lot. They look exactly as pictured, and have some noise-cancelling, which will be great for my twice daily commute on public transportation. I'll update this review once I've had them for a few weeks. Would definitely recommend."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loves these things, he's constantly shushing us when we talk loudly and he's watching his mickey mouse or playing his abc games. With these on, he doesn't make a sound. Their not overly loud so he can turn up the volume and we don't have to worry about damaging his hearing."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for work conference calls. I did have to buy a splitter to use on my desktop computer, but all in all, these are exactly what I was looking for. I do wish they had a clip to be able to fasten to my shirt so the microphone would stay put. Otherwise would have been 5 star."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these five months ago for my three girls who are 7, 6 and 6. They are only used on long car rides. They worked fine, but one cord has pulled out, one connecter has been broken off in a Kindle, and the pads are constantly falling off. Obviously, they would have lasted longer with gentler users, but they really weren't used that often."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm obsessed with these! I've purchased headphones that were way more expensive and were not as comfortable, sturdy, and well-designed as these. Like others have said, the cord is a rope, and reinforced around the attachment points so they're less flimsy. The entire headset is cushioned, so even the top of your head is comfy (some headphones with plastic headbands can bother me). And, finally, the music sounds really great. Highly recommend!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I compared these headphones to my sony white foldable head phones. The sound quality isn't %100, but isn't that bad either (I personally love a lot of bass). The headphones are a very snug fit (I guess I have to use them to get use to them) and turn more inward than flat on the ears which creates a more sound canceling outside of your environment. The color is as shown, very bright and vibrant mint color. The cord is the best part of these headphones due to it being fabric and not actual plastic (my cat likes to chew on headphones), and the cord is very long and also has a mic/pause/play button on it!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for my daughter ans she loves them
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 9 year old daughter loves her new headphones. She loves the color and the fit is comfortable. She uses them daily when dpi g homework on the iPad. We couldn't be happier with this purchase.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been spoiled by using the wheel on my previous set of headphones too easily turn down the overall volume. Unfortunately this set doesn't have that, but the quality of sound nearly makes up for it."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really LOVE these headphones. I origionally bought them for my kids for roadtrips, but I tried tthem out one day and I haven't stopped! I will need an extra set for myself for trips."

Good sound quality
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased thsee headphones twice and both times the cord broke within a couple of weeks. Waste of money.

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds impressive but the left ear cushion part has dropped off after 2 months of use. So I'm disappointed with that
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter loved them. Sound was good. Didn't last very long. Fell apart by the volume button.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had to give them to my 11 year old because they seemed a bit small for me. The headphone part only coverd part of my ear and would hurt after about a half hour. I love the vibrant colors and the quality is better then what I expected.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to buy because they were made by aliens and were so teal and pretty. Not the best sound quality, leaks sound, hurts ears after a while (especially if you wear earrings) but for $20, not bad. Love the cord too. Now knitting a case to keep them in."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just got them a few days ago. They fit well. I've only used them a little bit so I don't quite feel like I can give them 5 stars yet but they seem good.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids bought these to use for school. We home school with an online curriculum so they use headphones to listen to lectures all the time. They had gone through several pairs of the $12 versions from Wal-Mart that kept breaking and were not very comfortable for hours of use. These have received rave reviews from both students. Very comfortable, fold up for storage and bright fun colors and the cord is covered in matching material making it fun and more durable. I highly recommend though we can't attest to their sound quality for music.

**Update** I'm taking these down a star because two have had one of the ear muffs break off. They're so comfortable and affordable that we keep replacing them but this is disappointing."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Looks and sounds Great! Can not beat the price!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comparable to beats head phones. Why pay the price when these do the same job.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was shocked how good these sound considering how inexpensive they are. Super comfy too!
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After buying the first set and using them, I purchased 2 more sets. "" they work well and are easy to carry"". We use them on Iphones and Ipads.

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these head phones for my daughter for Christmas. They next day the side part broke. It is plastic. She was heartbroken so I bought another pauir because she liked the colors. So far the second pair has not broke.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones almost a month ahead of schedule. They were a gift for my granddaughter. They looked great, and must work well, since I haven't heard any complaints!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice, light weight headphone that folds into a compact size and are adjustable. Our favorite part is the nylon cable that makes it durable, especially for kids."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They seem to work great and are exactly the color my daughter loves, but they hurt her ears."

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work well! And a great price!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 8 year old daughter loves these headphones. Just received them today and she hasn't taken them off. The quality is great, the folding feature is nice and the color is perfect. Love that the cord is rope instead of a breakable plastic."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We got these for our 6 year old. We make the kids wear headphones or ear buds when they watch the iPad (especially when we're in the car) so that the whole family doesn't have to hear it, but ear buds hurt her ears or didn't fit right and she always complained about them. She absolutely loves these headphones, and our entire family is now grateful that we no longer have to listen to her shows. Very kid friendly and high quality!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price things couldn't be better. Comfortable headpiece with very good sound range. Perfect for an outdoor, knock around earphone. Works great inside too. While my family watches TV I can listen to music or other venues and still hear conversations, etc."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Female adult here and these fit great. You can adjust them A LOT. I was worried they wouldn't fit when they arrived but they did and are super comfortable for long days of wear. I use these at work to tune out and their sound quality is good but their sound noise cancelling is amazing. I don't have to have it loud in order to drown everything else out. Seems good quality so far and the color is awesome.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are kid sized! Not adult sized in spite of what it says. I am a small woman with small ears and these are too small for me. They also do not really collapse much at all. The ear pieces fold in a bit but that is all.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 10 year old for Christmas. Although it is only January 2nd, he uses them often and will bring them to school to be used in their computer centers. He loves the vibrant orange color and will always be able to pick his out in a line up. The sound quality is ok but probably not what an a real sound snob would like. They are perfect for what I bought them for and I would rebuy this if needed."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second pair of these headphones I have purchased. Now my daughter has one for school(she needs them for audiobooks) and we bought this pair for home. She uses them daily and LOVES them. The quality is excellent. We have had the first pair for over a year and they are still going strong. I am so impressed with these headphones. I would definitely recommend these! Amazing quality for such an inexpensive price!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are well made and hold up to young kids' using them. I can't speak to the sound quality as I haven't personally tested them out much, but I haven't heard any complaints. My little girl was somewhat disappointed that the wrong color was shipped to me, though. I ordered the pretty green (aqua?) and purple ones, but received the gray and green ones."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! I have bought a few pair of these & will buy more. With a family of 5, someone is always looking for headphones to watch a video or listen to music. These are great for watching videos & TV shows online (what I use them for). Music sounds great with them too. I really liked the cord on these (shoestring type cord) because they don't tangle as badly. My oldest son is a musician & when he comes to visit, he always ""borrows"" these & takes them home with him & to plug into his guitar & play without using an amp/speaker to practice. I like the headband on these vs some of the other brands because it hold up to kids pulling them off (they tend to pull them off in such a way that breaks the headband)."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have one flight with kids and need a glorified throwaway set of headphones, then you could consider these. The sound quality is atrocious, embarrassing compared to an average adult set. If quality is even a smidgeon of a factor for you, spend an extra few dollars and get a better set. If price is your only motivating factor, then these are hard to beat."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Super cute, but the earphone padding has come off multiple times and is near impossible to put back on."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good sound for such a low price. These were purchased for a 10 year old child who needs to use earplanes when flying to stabilize cabin pressure. These headphones are going to work great.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke 1 day outside the return policy.. The speaker itself fell out.. If they broke from abuse I could see that but only used a few times..

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. I use these headphones instead of ear buds when using the treadmill because I find it annoying when the ear buds are falling out of my ears.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my in-laws who live in another country.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, my kid hasn't broken them yet, so that is a good sign. She also ignores the crap out of her dad and I, so I am assuming the sound and volume are good. A good product for the price, definitely would purchase them again."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are terrible, the foam on one of the sides fell off after 2 weeks of use, not the whole ear piece has fallen off and is hanging on by a wire. Cheap and not work the purchase!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's really stylish, but I really don't like the fact that everybody can hear what I listen too. Even if it was set on the lowest volume...

UPDATE: Got some new pairs and its a bit better than the old headphones."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and it's comfortable.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor fit and poor sound quality.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound. Comfortable. The cord is very sturdy which seems to always be the first think to breakdown! Ear pads are small- so probably not the best headphones for older kids!

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a small head and it hurts my ears after longer than 30 minutes. I think the culprit is that the ear pads are too small. I'm considered a smaller than average person 5"" 2, 130lbs, small cap size, so anyone smaller than me might find this comfortable, but I don't. Also, you can't hear your own voice in the ear piece, even though there is a microphone."

I bought this for my daughter as 2016 xmas gift, today is 04/08/17 and they don't work anymore. We liked them a lot but in less than 4 months they stopped working. I'm now shopping for new ones for my kid. This time I'll invest a little more so we can try to get better quality. Hope this helps. Thx."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Color and sound is fine, what really irks me about this product though is that when using it with my iphone, it'll somehow trigger Siri, or cause my music to fast forward or skip to the end of the song. NO idea what causes this, but my audio imput is clean and no other headset does this. Pretty clear that these headphones are the cause. Thought I could ignore it since it only happened rarely when I first bought it, but incidents have been happening with increasing frequency lately.

Really annoying when I wanna jam out but my tunes keep getting interrupted by Siri asking me whats up.

Would not buy again."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I just got these, put them on, and they blew my socks right off the soles of my feet. For the price I paid ($16.99)??? They remind me of the Bose headphones I got at Costco for $169. That's 10 times what I paid for these. And yes, they are incredibly comfortable! They are as comfortable as those Bose headphones were, too. You should definitely buy these.

And by the way, I rarely give a product review, but these folks really deserve the boost in their ratings. Great product."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I will start this off with that I really like the headphones. They have great sound quality, which I was a bit worried about, and are rather comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the earmuffs are a lot smaller than I was expecting. They don't cup your ears, they just rest over them. Which is not what I was going for. So be aware of that if you are going for headphones that fully cover, as in ""cup around"" your ears rather than just sit on them. These do not do that. But if that isn't a big deal for you these are really great! Great bass and sound, comfortable to wear both on the ears and the band that rests on your head. It has a different type of cord that feels sort of like a cloth mesh that is easily untangled which is nice. It has a mic for phone calls but I haven't tried that yet. Over all great set of headphones and I do suggest it for the price and quality."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my needs. It does get a tad bit uncomfy for long periods, but thats okay. I love the color purple/pink in that it discourages my husband from stealing it from me. The mic is super handy to talk through as well."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great budget wired set, good sound quality on mike and headphones plus foldable make it an easy portable. No worries about dead batteries or wireless connections to cell phones, Sorry iPhone 7 users this ain't for you. Great colors choices to suit all takers. Great product overall its a thumbs up from me."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone are okay I guess... if you like having a burden on your ears.

The sound quality from these headphones are more like a distant sound, not as vivid, and unclear.
When you wear the headphones, after a good 5 or 10 minutes, my ears started to hurt, and it was just an uncomfortable feeling to witness.
The headphones definetly do bend, but when bent, they are still a bit big, defeating the purpose.

The only reason I barely like this is because I personally think the design in cool, just that the qualities lack a ton. 2 stars..."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoy these headphones. Very basic, but with good in sound. Very comfortable. I purchase a pair for myself first, but gave them to my son as he needes a new set lf headphones. I then purchased 3 more as Christmas gifts for my two nephews and my daughter. A couple of says later I totally forgot I needed a pair, so I bought a pair for myself. Thank goodness for the variety of colors available!! :)"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are super cute, they travel nicely and the sound quality is great, but there are a few issues that keep them from being 5 stars.

They're tight on the ears, causing mild pain if I wear them for over a few hours. Also, the plug doesn't fit in as snugly as i'd like, leading me to double check it's in there. Not too bad, but enough to be a tiny nuisance.

I bought them to replace my broken set of headphones (one of a long line of ones whose cords frayed and whose sound just quit) so i'm not sure how they'll hold up. Hopefully, they'll last."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Due to noise issues at work, I needed a good, though reasonably priced, set of noise cancelling earphones.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are headphones for those of us who are not worried about high quality. They are just as expected. Take care of the cord, which is a good length if you do not need extra for walking away from the item you are connecting to. But they are definitely for smaller heads. I always forget to look at how the headphone ear pieces close tightly together in the picture. I need the kind that have a separation and are not squeezing your head. Also the length change comes just at the end of both sides of the earphones. It is just a few inches and there is not angle change, just a length change. I prefer the angle to move also. My kids took them from me which works well for them. I need a pair that is a little more flexible for my head and has just a little bit bigger foam ear cups."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,it feels comfortable but after say 30 minutes for me it starts to hurt my hears

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good especially for the price.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Has very nice bass and sound. The cord is protected by a soft cotton-like rope, making it hard to damage. The color is very cute and fashionable, so it can be used as an accessory too. I did sprint intervals and didn't need to adjust them even once, much better than ear buds which would periodically fall out no matter what I did. The only problem, is that they are difficult to sleep in and prolonged use (four hours+) makes my ears sore. They can be worn with freshly pierced earrings if you adjust them at the right angle. Overall a very nice product, I would definitely by another pair for just exercising! Also, the sound is great compared to beats and bose headphones. In my opinion, they are better than beats. However, bose headphones block out ALOT of noise. When I put these on it muffles noise and when I turn the volume up high I can block out loud radio sounds, but bose heaphones I can't hear anything, so overall a very nice product at a cheap price."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered one and liked it so well I ordered another a few months later. Good sound and seem to hold up to my jerking around on the ear piece and cables. Feels good on the ear. Is large enough to help block out other outside noises.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,When we received these we like the color but the ear piece fabric came off on the same day. Also you could not hear in them very well they weren't very loud. We had to rig them to actually get to where you could hear good. Definitely a waste of money! My daughter was so disappointed. I would not recommend these to anyone. !!! (mad.sad face)
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were great until they just stopped working with two months of use.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's get what you pay for. 20 USD justifies the bad ergonomics, lack of noise-cancellation (and why was this listed when I specified noise cancellation on the filters?). The headphones only swivel on the horizontal axis and goes up and down for head size... but sadly it doesn't swivel on the forward- backward axis. Now this will be fine with people with small heads, but not to me. It feels awkward and my ears feels it's not completely covered."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I accidently bought two (my fault). I'm keeping the one I opened and returning the other. I don't even want to give those away. The sound is good. But they are not comfortable. The ear pieces have no lateral flexibility and so don't seat properly. And, the whole thing feels like a big, stiff and painful headband. Really wanted to love these."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter is happy with these, but after a month, a piece of the cord that looked like a patch wore off and exposed frayed wires. My husband patched them back together, but I guess you get what you pay for!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Was pretty happy with these for a few weeks but suddenly whenever I have these headphones plugged in, it screws with the volume and play/stop controls. More or less makes these useless since I can't listen to a song for 10 seconds without it pausing and going to no sound to max volume and then skipping to the next song. I've used other headphones since with no issue, so it's definitely this pair."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re good headphones but they fell apart quickly. I bought my first pair in August 2017, and they were rendered completely unusable in late February 2018. I got a good 6 months or so out of the headphones. They’re good sound quality, they don’t get as loud as I’d like, but they work for everyday use. I liked them so much I ended up buying a second pair, so hopefully they last longer than the first pair."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re super comfortable and look very cute, just like the picture. For the price, they sound pretty good. I like how they can fold up too. I ended up giving them to my friend as a present and will most likely buy another for myself in the future. They’re worth buying if you want some decent headphones but don’t want to get something too expensive."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The cord broke within a few months.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product definitely is worth the price it's very well made got here on time I've been using it for about a month without any problems and I just love them plus the sound quality isn't bad at all I fact it's good for the price.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is pretty good but the buttons don't work
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone jack broke INSIDE of my iPad! I’m so pissed! Headphones are only a few months old.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure wha the problem is but I just returned from a trp on JetBlue....the jack did not work properely in tdio system in the plane....
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones are very comfy with good sound. She uses them so much sometimes they wear out. I bought 2 pair this time.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price. My daughter now wants a pair for her iPad.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound Quality is ok (worse than apple earbuds). Hurts ears after a while if you wear glasses. The noise cancellation is probably the best thing about this headphone.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For an adult, they get a little tight after a while. They were a tad big on a 4 year old, but fine. Green color is pretty cord has a fabric color."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my grandson. He loves them!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ear cushions come off all the time and are difficult to put back on.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son and he loves them. I tried them, and found they have great sound quality and block out external noises."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are actually on-ear, not over-ear. I felt the distinction was necessary for comfort reasons--On-ear headphones make my ears sore after a while from pressing onto my ears, so for extended use I don't see myself using them, hence the four stars. Otherwise it's a very good product-- I do use them for Skype conversations for work, which is the main reason I bought mic headphones, and the orange color is REALLY REALLY bright, like neon-level. The collapsibility is nice for storage. I'll be looking into getting Over-Ear pads that fit these for comfort purposes."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The left ear pad came off after using it for only 3 days. The sound quality was good but the ear pads not that good. I'm returning this product.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I was looking for for my son. Great price point and he loves it.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones with clear quality. No instructions in packet how to use the microphone.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These hold up to kids wear and tear.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great and look good - but they broke the second time my son used them!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!!
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work great. A little tight on my ears due to glasses.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight but as soon as you put it on you cant hear anything else! great sound quality and super soft!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them for my 2 year old daughter and they are a little big but once she gets a little older they should work great.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones are great but the mic is horrible.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Within two months, they were already messed up and not able to be used. When you try to listen, it sounds like chipmunks speaking."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy the used one... it said it as only a problem with esthetics and it actually doesn't work! D: so sad now i need to return it and wait more for another product that does work.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are comfortable easily portable headphones. The sound quality is absolutely fine for my listening. I use them at work with music on low to block out surrounding noise. I bought a second pair for my husband. Unfortunately, our puppy immediately ate through the cord (good reminder to keep things out of reach). I liked them so much that I immediately got him another pair to replace the first one. My wish for improvement would be to make the cord detachable as that seems to be where headphones are most vulnerable. Overall, these headphones are a great value for the price. They arrived on time. I love the color selection."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very durable
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two pairs and both have same issue. Under engineered ear levers hinges the ear pieces broke the same way on both pairs, thus the hinge pins fall right out. Otherwise good headphones but faulty design. Took roughly 3 months both time for them to fail."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not some super picky music aficionado, but these are a great product for an incredible price. They do a pretty reasonable job of noise cancelling, which will be nice on airplanes (I bought an airplane adapter). I use these for all my lengthy phone calls and they work great for that. No one says they can't hear me. I have a Lifeproof case, and I've just whittled down all the extra plastic on the plug so that I can insert it directly into the case without the adapter. I bought the case too (I think there wasn't one specifically for these headphones, but same brand nearly identical had a case), so I can fling them around everywhere. Very happy with this purchase!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very small, uncomfortable, and hard. These are definitely children's headphones. The sound is also very tinny. I was so disappointed when I unboxed them and tried them out. I immediately exchanged them for a better known brand that was a little more expensive.

One star only for the braided cord, which I was rather impressed by the quality of."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first set of headphones I found that I love! The price is very reasonable. They fold up great for storage. They fit snug around my head without any pain that I had experienced in the past with other headphones; thanks to the cushioning around the ear pieces. These headphones were for my work and I have no trouble keeping out the unwanted noise from the office. Also, my music has never sounded so great! I am definitely going to buy a pair for my home. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to buy expensive headphones."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 12 year old daughter who used them daily at school and at home. She liked the comfort and sound of the headphones but they didn't last long. Less than 3 months after purchasing them, the plastic clamping band that hold the ear piece to the headband came apart. I thought my daughter broke them but after close inspection, I found the two Phillips screws that hold the clap together are just too short and don't thread very far into a female stud on the opposite side of the clamp."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Headphones look, sound and feel like a premium quality, as its new. Will update this review after using in my way for couple of weeks.

Foam seems addictively squishy, doesn't irritate much on your ears. Though they Warm your ears, if not placed correctly or used continously. Hanging around neck seems painful, of course depends on neck size. Personally, its a bad idea, i felt like ostrich dropping them around neck. Nilon wire seems solid and strengthy. Never rely on edges, as that's where the headphones fail most of the times. Wire outlet from the earphone seems delicate and other edge towards jack is strong.

Surprise amazon coupon inside which will give you 20% off on your next purchase of Ailihen products only, probably another Headphone.

For the price, the build quality just seems shocking. I have seen cheaper build qualities priced high. This one seems top notch among the competitors."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphone for the money. They are comfortable to wear. The bass is solid, although not overpowering. They are designed to let you have a very pleasant musical experience. They are not a Beats clone which have a tendency to emphasize the bass region at the sacrifice of the mid and upper musical ranges. The cord is long enough for any application. They are not noise cancelling, but once the music is playing you will not notice a lot of sound from the outside environment. I purchased the hard shell case and will take them on my next flight. The headphones and the case come in for under $30. You can certainly spend a lot more and there are better sounding headphones out there, but for under $20 you will not find any headphone that even comes close. If you want the absolute best, buy a headphone from Bose. If you are looking for a great value, look no further."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter needed new headphones for her iPod because let's face it, those little buds that come with it just won't stay in an 11-year old's ears. After looking around I found these and took a chance that they might do the trick, you never know with a pre-teen girl what she will like. Needless to say, she loved the color and thought that they were awesome, so score one for mom, finally! They are noise reducing which she loves as it drowns out her little brother, but not me or so she says. I just remind her that I will only repeat myself twice and that I don't mind dancing in public to get her attention. I figure a little public humiliation never hurt anyone, especially me. So far they work perfectly with her iPod and her PC so I can't complain and I really like that they fold up to be compact and don't take up a lot of space. They are very padded and look comfortable, but I wonder how they will feel this summer in the Alabama heat while we do yard work. Overall, excellent product for and excellent price in my opinion."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good headphones for the money. My one complaint would be that, like a lot of other headphones, the audio channels in the Stereo feature feed into each other where you can hear both channels prominently in the other even when the sound is supposed to be isolated to one side. This is a minor annoyance for headphones I paid this little for. The sound quality and the depth of the bass is really great for what they cost. And they even have a microphone, which I haven't tested yet. Best of all, I mean, I don't have to worry too much about losing them or tearing them up because they barely costed anything. If they last a year or two, that's a big value for the price tag."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the stylish color scheme of these headphones. I bought them for my daughter to use and the purple on black works well for her. The sound quality is excellent, especially for the price range. They are also very soft and comfortable to wear. The volume control is easy to use for kids. The cable is braided which helps keep it from kinking and means it should last a lot longer. Finally, I really like that these fold up for easy storage or to take on a trip."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fell apart after 2 uses.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My boyfriend bought this for me in the gray and lime green color. I was very excited to try this out. The sound quality was great and the fit was perfect. I was worried because I saw a lot of review related to kids wearing these so I wasn't sure if these would fit an adult sized head but they do. Yay! Very comfortable for endless days watching Netflix and Hulu! LOL! They keep a lot of outside noise out as well so its great.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially bought these headphones because of the cute color combination, but I really love the way that they work they work absolutely amazing they have great sound quality and the microphone is awesome as well I would highly recommend this product."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! I absolutely love the color scheme, as well as the fact that they are foldable. I'm a college student, so I love that these take up minimal space in my bag. I have used these repeatedly and the sound quality so far is still awesome. These are quite (but not fully) noise-canceling. I have quite a wide head and these sit comfortably on my head without any squeezing. I hope these hold up, because they are so cute and have great quality for the price!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"To be fair the headphone has a good sound and the microphone to be used with phone or skype use is a good thing. My issue is that I have only used it a few times and the headphone cover has already separated from the ear piece. Although this may not be a very expensive headphone, I am very disappointed because it started as very promising and actually comfortable to wear. Anyway, if the piece did not separate with just a few times of use, I would probably would have given it a better review."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great short term. Daughter used them on 1600 mile roadtrip with no stops like a champ! The only thing was after a few months the padding around the ear pieces pulled off very easily when getting the item out of her storage bag for her tablet and accessories.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered two of these (different colors) for my daughters. A little upset that one of them doesn't work as well as the other. One is not as loud as the other and also the padding comes off every time my daughter tries to use hers.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! The pastel colors are my favorite. The sound quality is awesome and they are very comfortable. I don't typically take them for working out, I use them more at home, meditating or listening to music. For those purposes, they are perfect!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 8 year old to use with her tablet. They provide a good balance of her still being able to hear us, but her also feeling like she can focus on her game or video without being annoyed at other people around her. Seem durable, comfortable."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the noise cancelling and the sound is fantastic, the headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. My daughter wore them for about an hour and had to take them off as they were hurting her and making her ears red. These headphones definitely wouldn't work for an adult."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality headphones
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for son in law. likes a lot.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter to use with her Samsung NoteTab 4. At first they did not work, but it was a setting on the tablet; so make sure to check all the settings first if they seem not to work.

First impression was well built and soft ear cups. They did not work initially, as stated above, with her tablet, so I plugged them into my LG G3 and turned on some tunes. I was not expecting the clarity and volume of the sound. I cranked it up and really no discernible distortion at full volume. The cord length is adequate, but it does tend to tangle up. There is also no protection at the cord junction to the ear cup, so hopefully the cord does not get pulled out or bent and shorted.

She uses them all the time, since April, and they are still holding shape and comfort. The sound has not deteriorated and she still folds them up without any issues. She has a habit of letting things lay about and sometimes get sat on when left on the couch under a blanket. They are still in one piece and working great.

For the clarity and volume of sound, the durability, and the price these are a great buy - out weighs potential issues one might run into with the cord."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the foldable sleek design, so they're great on the go and in a bag. The sound quality is great at this price.And they're good looking! The product exceeded my expectations for sure."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"not really an ""Over The Ear"" product unless you have VERY small ears' a longer cord would be a big plus too. Add LZYCO USB External Stereo Sound Audio Adapter when using this with a Windows PC"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter loves them and gets lots of compliments on them. They fit better and sound is better than on previous headphones. Love the way they ear pieces fold into the center. Quality product
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for other librarians at work and ended up buying a pair for myself. I can wear them for about two hours before my ears get a little tired. They do just the right amount of sound deadening for me. I can still hear (albeit mutedly) what's going on but I can tune it out when I wear these.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised how great these headphones were for the price. Amazing sound, especially the base. Padding on the headband really makes these headphones more comfortable. Some sound leakage at medium and high volume, but not much. Perfect for music, videos, and really just good for anything! I love the color, I got the orange and black. The cord is a tad bit long, but still I was expecting much less for the price. Cord texture is nice. My conclusion is, just go ahead and bye these things, there awesome! Thanks for reading, have a nice day!"

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones, but they are meant for a small head, which I unfortunately do not have. I have a hard time wearing them for long periods of time because they squeeze a bit, making it uncomfortable in the long run. That said, they're good quality and I haven't had any trouble with them working well!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset with mike. Purchased for gaming, really adds to the experience, but us them for listening to music and smartphone. Construction seems very good. Like the cloth insulation on the cord. Maybe work on color schemes and open you market to more than kids."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my daughter for Christmas to use with her iPod. They worked wonderfully and she used them daily. About 6 months after she got them they started cutting out and making funny noises. We thought it was the iPod doing it so we had her use her dads headphones and it stopped doing it. She is super bummed. They were great while they lasted.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, cushioned and comfortable, fun colors, foldable, and they really contain the sound. As a mom of two kids who wear them, they are perfect!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well made but somewhat ill-fitting. Also no left or right indication on the headphones.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"these are lovely and lightweight, but if you turn the sound up to over halfway they're effectively speakers rather than headphones."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fantastic. Super soft and great sound quality.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The microphone part of the cord broke after one day. Used duct tape to cover the break in the cord and luckily they still work. Being used by a 9 year old, but should last longer than a day."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They shipped fast and are very comfortable, even while wearing them for hours."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is using these for kindergarten computers she seems to love them.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,a great set of headphones with a high end feel to them. my kids each have a set of diffrent colors and use them everyday without issue.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, they are soft and comfortable to use. My kids really enjoy them and they fit them well. I love how they fold up too."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great for my daughter. Bought 2 pairs, one for home and one for school."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones do not work with my smartphone (samsung galaxy j7). Every time they are plugged in, my media volume will randomly, and sometimes several times in rapid succession, drop my media volume all the way down or turn it all the way up. This makes them completely unusable as I intensely dislike having my music turned off repeatedly and also having it unpredictably blast so loudly that it hurts my ears. The color scheme is nice, the cord is durable, and the audio quality is acceptable. Unfortunately these good qualities have no bearing on the one all-encompassing detractor."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were very cool visually but uncomfortable to wear over glasses; the earpiece is small and sits much more on top of the ear than other over-the-ear headphones I've tried, which used some of the space around the ear. I have a smallish head so I was surprised that they were too tight when I was wearing glasses (they were comfortable without the glasses)."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To prevent hearing loss, I wanted to buy over the ear headphones for watching TV (as I don't want to annoy family, I use headphones). These are a lovely color, adjust fit easily, and the sound is great, you barely have to turn up the volume. For value (as headphones can get pricey), these are worth the price."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My little girl says these are great. She uses them all the time and says they are very comfortable. The headphones are durable and comfortable. They block outside noises so he can concentrate on the program.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! The cord is very durable-seeming, and the whole design is nice. The only thing that would make these better would be if they had different sizes for different-sized heads. I think my head is average-sized, but these feel tight. Wearing it for hours can give me a headache."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh my goodness...these feel like butter! The material they used is luxury. They look very comfortable on my kiddos too (ages 7 and 9)...they dont look too tight at all. I am so happy with this purchase.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best set of wired headphones I've ever tried. For the price, I wasn't expecting much but after opening the package, I found an extremely high quality product. The materials used on these look like what you would find on more expensive headphones. The leather ear cups and headband are very soft and comfortable. The cord is wrapped in a braided material similar to shoelaces and is just long enough. The sound on these is amazing. I played hip hop music and the bass is tight without being overwhelming. There is very little sound leakage when wearing these. I have no complaints at all and recommend to anyone."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love these headphones. They are very comfortable and help cancel out my co-worker's annoying radio. They also work with my ipad so I can listen to my own music. Excellent price and good quality. I would purchase again.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 5 year old, and am not disappointed. They are so incredibly soft and comfortable, plus the cord feels more like a shoelace, which should be much more durable. The sound quality is great as well. Very happy with my purchase."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphones. Purchased these for my daughter after a pair of earbuds didn't fit properly. These are cushioned, adjustable, colorful, and sturdy. The cord is encased inside fabric/woven material and seems to be much more durable that regular headphone/earbud cords. The plug would not work in the earphone jack on the front of a computer tower, however it apparently works in the back earphone jack. These exceeded my expectations in both price and quality, seem like they will last, and my daughter says they are comfortable. Would recommend this to anyone not keen on the idea of earbuds, and/or want something comfy to listen to music/do techy activities."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Headphones, kid approved. small enough for my 5 & 7 year old yet expands large enough for adults. Braided cord is extra long. I love that these for small for easy storage. We own 2 pair. Have been greatly used for road trips, at the computer and tablet time over the past 5 or 6 months with no signs of issues. We will be purchasing again if/when time arises."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The color is fantastic, they sound great and the microphones works well. A bonus that I didn't realize is that they fold up which is awesome and it makes it really easy to store them as I'm on the go. Overall, I am very happy with them！"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,these are nice but the size if the ear cuffs can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and the mic doesn't pick up consistently. however they look nice and are easy to hear out of so if youre using them just to listen to music they are good!
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,these are really cute...only problem is the speaker without the wire coming out of it doesn't have the same loudness as the other side. Might just be this one defective pair but my daughter still uses them and loves them
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,They broke after a few days of use. The plastic for the button on the cord fell apart. They seemed to work well. I'd spend a bit more money next time and get something more reliable. I was hoping to get a few months of use out of these.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are noise cancelling. Cool colors and material. I don't like that you can hear the music completely from the outside, that bothers me..."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones work for the amount of money that it costs. For cheap headphones, this is okay. Other people can hear what you're listening to from the outside, but it's fairly faint until the sound is fairly loud. I think it is good for louder places where nice headphones would get ruined, which is what I used it for. I had brought it to swim meets and because it was cheap, didn't care about the water getting close to them. They also have microphones that can be turned on and off, which is extremely handy. Overall, very good for the cheap price."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones! They fit well, they sound great, the cord is long enough to where you don't have to be practically holding your device the whole time. I use them most often with my laptop and they really work well. I haven't tried the microphone so I can't judge that. Overall I love these, I would buy again if I needed to."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I loooove the color of these; they are just as pictured. I'm an adult but I have a relatively small head so these fit me, but I can see them not for a larger headed adult. They also pinch my ears a little bit after wearing them for awhile, but for the price they are definitely great."

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good, but the ear muffs have no flexibility.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I get this headphone for my daughter and she loves it
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter, she likes how they fold up, sound is good, price is good, arrived quickly. She liked the color a lot. She likes how they feel on her head as well. Good deal."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate using the earbuds because they hurt my ears. These headphones fit snug and comfortably on my adult-size head, and the sound quality is amazing! I intend on only using them for listening to iPod/iPhone music, so I won't be using the microphone feature. They fold up easily and tuck into a drawer for storage.

A great set of headphones for a great price!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using these for one day there is already a constant static-y noise in one of the ears, no matter what I am listening or not listening to.

EDIT: customer service reached out and replaced my product. They were very attentive and made sure the product was working."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used it a couple times. Only one side works. 3 months old. Tired of this happening. Pretty color and soft. Nice if it would work. Probably can't return and too much work.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I could give 0 stars. These were a Christmas gift for my daughter. Not even a month after getting them the cord is already shorted out and they are not working.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These broke within the first few uses. Apparently, we are beyond the return window. The hack actually broke off inside the device they were plugged into. Don't waste your money."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First, the fit was a little uncomfortable for me after several hours of use - it felt like the ear cuffs were squeezing my head (or perhaps my head is just really big). More importantly, after two months of using them, they made this terrible popping sound, which pretty much made them unusable. They are stylish and cute but the quality was just not there for me."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones feel good on the ears and head. The tangle free cord makes it easy to quickly put on when a call is coming in.
My only concern is that sometimes the volume on my phone will be at its lowest setting but my headphone volume will be stuck at a volume that is to high for me. My next headphones will have volume control."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really cute and are very study from a craftsmanship standpoint, but unfortunately they are so tight that they give me a headache every time I try to wear them, it's literally like having my head squashed by a vice. No adjustment seems to help, so I just wear them for 30 minutes at a time since that's all I can tolerate. Maybe it's me, but I don't perceive that I have a giant head like the kid in So I Married An Axe Murderer.

The sound is just okay, to me it's personally a bit muddy. For the price I wasn't expecting the quality of my late beloved Bose headphones, but it's still kind of a bummer."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hoping these would work better with hearing aids, however, they push my hearing aids and ears together so that after about 30 minutes, I have to take them off because it is so uncomfortable."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter love her headphones!!!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loved them
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these a few months ago for my children (10 and 8) and the sound went out. Had to repurchase. Hoping these will last longer.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"***update 11/10. When the seller saw my review I got an email asking if I would like the 2 headphones I purchased and had some problems with, refunded or would I like 2 new ones. We chose to try them again. This time we are being a little more careful with them. They are super soft and great sound. Kids enjoy them. I'm very grateful to the seller for reaching out...shows great customer service. We did get only one headphone replacement , but I believe the second one will come.

Really great sound, cancels noise from outside well. The kids said they are really comfortable. I bought one for each kid for our two week vacation. By day three my son's feel apart. One pin broke and it fell off, then next day they comfort part fell off. We sorta got them back together. On the last day my daughters had the comfort part fall off too. I'm disappointed at how easily they broke...defiantly not meant for kids."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with product and seller
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First I was sent the wrong color but then Amazon told me I could just keep them at no charge so I figured, what the heck, these will do. Well, I've used other headphones on my laptop but the connector prong on this set not only doesn't fit in the hole securely but if you do plug it in all the way, the sound cuts off. So you have to pull it out just enough that it connects. Believe me, it's not very convenient when I'm using them on a conference call, I turn my head, the cord comes out and I just missed what was said. Additionally, they put quite a lot of pressure your ears and I have a small head! Would not buy again."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome! High volume, easy to store, super cute. Noise canceling."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 4/21/17: had these less than a month before one of the ear pieces broke off. Super glued it on, and then the other side broke off. After this happened twice on each side, I've decided these are totally not worth it. Investing in another pair that will stay in one piece.

Got these for my almost 4 year old daughter's kindle. Perfect for what we are using them for - easily foldable, great sound quality and cute color (we got the light teal and lilac color). She loves them and I loved the price!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are awesome! We travel quite a bit and my kids are always wanting to watch a movie on the plane but those ear buds they give you always fall out of their tiny ears. These headphones are a great quality. The are so comfortable as well.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Soft and stylish. However, if you are looking for a pari of headphones that your confident your child will handle gently, then these headphones are for you. I found these to be really pretty. Packaging was nice and headphones were super soft. My daughter also loved the colors. Unfortunately, the soft headphone part fell off with ease. The day I gave it to her for Christmas, and she is really responsible with her belongings. I saw it happen. I cannot in good faith give this a 5 star rating because of how easily the soft part of the headphones that fell off was could not be placed back on the headphones. I am really hoping that I just got a pair of headphones that were defective."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are beautiful, lightweight on your head (don't make your ears sweat!) and the sound was honestly 100x better than I expected at this price point. Highly recommended."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my five-year-old great-granddaughter. She really loves them. They work great with my phone however they do not work with my Kindle. That is very disappointing.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great! Bought these for my granddaughter to use with her iPad when traveling in vehicle. They are made very durable for a small child and feel comfortable when she wears them. She loves the pink color that matches her tablet case. These were a hit for Christmas!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is excellent. It is loud and fits just right. However, it is bit too tight wearing it. I bought this for my wife and she loves it but keeps complaining that it is too tight for her head. She is a very petite and short lady."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a few months. Very disappointed.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the color makes them easy to find in my messy room. very light. I take them on trips. I am not a headphone aficionado, but I found the sound quality to be great. the cord is braided so it does not twist easily, which i really like."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,They look really cool. Sound was pretty good. But the ear pads and outer material on the headband started peeling pretty quickly. They broke within about 2 months of normal use.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these,..& durable for my daughter"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who is normally pretty good with her stuff but even then these only lasted about 2 months before the cord frayed and the wires were exposed. She may have been a little tough on these but I didn't notice her abusing them at all and my youngest is even harder on his things and his have lasted 3 times as long! Maybe my circumstances are giving me an unfair biase towards these but I would be a bit wary on how long the cord will last. But then again you can't really beat the price so you get what you pay for and perhaps even more if you are lucky

And, they look nice, even in the color combo I purchased (well, they were less expensive -- planned to use them at home anyway). But, they may chew your ears off! Mine were completely red after about 30 minutes of wear. I'm not a very big guy, so it wasn't like I was trying to fit these over a square block of a head. Maybe it's just my ears, but do hear this: These things are tight. I'm sending them back."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my youngest daughter. She told me that if I ever write a review to inform the people that this product only lived for one month and that she's not at all happy about it...my baby's review.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an adult woman, with an admittedly small head and tiny ears, and these fit perfectly! Very cute. They feel a little fragile, when folding or extending them. They've held up well for me, but I've only had them for a short time and with light use. I mostly bought them for their appearance, but I've found them very comfy with good sound quality."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The stereo headphones I ordered were a disappointment due to one key feature that the product description claimed' ""with excellent noise-cancelling function."" This product does not have and noise cancelling function or capability as far as I can tell. Price point was in reality too good to be true for a product whose mfg. makes this claim of functionality."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent lightweight and great clear sounds headset. Noise cancelling feature is very nice. I can listen to my music as loud as I want to and not bother anyone.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great little headphones but the operative word is ""little"". They would be perfect for a child but the ear pieces are to small for an adult. They hurt my ears after about 10 minutes because they do not sit correctly on adult size ears. No, my ears are normal size so that is not the issue. I wouldn't recommend them for an adult but would purchase for a child. Wish the description on Amazon had indicated that the were small."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work beautifully for watching streaming video so I don't disturb others. They fold into a compact position. They're comfy. They're affordable. And ... they're a cheerful color.

Whenever I try to adjust the cable, the audio tunes out and is barely able to be heard. Only buy these as a backup pair until you decide on good quality ones! Also, the entire box and even the instructions are in Japanese! The only reason why I'm rating 2 stars instead of 1 is because the light blue ones look very cute (at least in my opinion).

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Boughttese for grandaughter and was suprised at the sound quality.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were much better than I expected! Although they have really high reviews I thought how great could they be if they're only $20? I was debating getting beats but didn't feel like spending so much so I thought lemme give these a try. Came in really nice packaging, the rose color is actually pretty in person and definitely sound blocking! Great to drown out background noise while studying and even better at the gym when I'm running on the treadmill- they don't fall off like my apple ear buds do. Sound quality is pretty great and the wire is longer than most headphones so much more convenient. Great buy highly recommend!"

The sound is better than any headphones i have had. they collapse which is a huge plus when traveling or camping. Have not tried the built in microphone yet, but will. awesome product and the best part is the price."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible sound quality, muffed and changes volumes when the cord is moved. Really bad"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,These worked great when we first got them but brook within a month. The hinge on the actual ear cover is very weak and made of plastic so after some use it just snapped!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While my kids like the headphones they dont last very long. The first one broke after 5 month, it was replaced under warranty, only to break after 4 month again."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones so far. They are comfortable & are adjustable. The color is exactly what I expected - I absolutely love the purple & pink. I use these at work to watch movies & listen to music. They are a little bulky but that is why I bought them - ear buds hurt my ears & these are just so comfortable.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, these are very pretty, but the rubber is turning brown on one section... Daughter just opened the package to start using them for school. See pic. How do I exchange for another pair/ return? Thank you- kweldon2001@yahoo.com"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time, nice colors. Only issue is that they are REALLY tight. While I can make the head piece longer, this does very little to make them less tight. And I have a smallish head and small ears."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is pretty rough with her belongings and these headphones hold up great. WH often plays games and listens to cartoons while I am in meetings and I cannot hear a thing through them in a quiet room. It is a quality purchase.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"At first these headphones were great, my son loved them. He said they were very comfortable and worked well. We've had them just under 2 months and they are already malfunctioning. He has to hold the plug a certain way to be able to hear anything. I'm really disappointed that these didn't last longer.

Edit* while I'm still disappointed in the headphones the customer service was great. They didn't hesitate to make this right, refunded my order very fast and were extremely polite. I increased my rating to 3 stars because of the customer service provided. Maybe I just received a defective pair."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the color and they really hold up to sweat. I do find that the eat cups r a little too small for my ears. I still really like them use them when I work out.

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, amazing color, and very comfortable padding!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kind of a snug fit on the ear. No adjustment there. Sound quality was decent. But that's not why I'm down rating this. Purchased in January 2016 and in about 6 months one side went out. (Wiggle the cord at the plug and it would go in and out). Thinking it was probably just the ""bad"" luck of the draw, and since I liked the sound I reordered same model in December 2016. Sure enough, 6 months later, one side has gone out. And again, the short seems to be at the plug end. Won't order another one of these."

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is not that great - kind of flat - comparing to other products from the same price range. The ears hurt after 5-10 minutes of wearing them. Plus, videos stop and start on it's own- my wild guess is - it is lousy connection at the insertion port side. I have iPad. If it were just one bad thing, it would be bearable. Having all of the defects at once made earphones unusable. I regret not returning them before I discarded the package."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very inexpensive high quality product.... Very happy with the headset.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones quit working after a month! They're nothing but junk!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones appear to be good value. I bought five of them in the last year for my daughters. All broke or stopped working within a few months. The first was minor, the headphone speaker cushion fell off, as if not enough glue. I just noticed that one of my daughters put another headphone in the cart and I was thinking this whole time that they just wanted new colors - nope. They told me just now they don't work. I searched my order history and found five orders for these headphones. Good value but they are low quality. The sound is good and lightweight but don't expect a long life out of them. Gave them two stars since they're inexpensive."

They arrived today, I took them each out of the box looked them over, plugged them in and made sure they worked. All 3 sets were beautiful in color and all worked just fine. I'm sure they will be well received by the children at Christmas time. Thank you Ailihen."

I bought these because I love the colors, but I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent sound quality. They're so much better than earbud.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is our second pair. Comfortable, not necessarily noise cancelling but definitely muffles outside noise, inexpensive and great for traveling with kids."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were a replacement for a pair I stepped on and broke! These are for our grandson and he uses them constantly. They fit comfortably over his ears and the colorful orange is easy to find. Sound quality is fantastic. A real quality product. Thank you!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light Weight Sound Great. They aren't totally noise reducing, but I can close out the world with these on. I do get a little bit of pain on my right ear lobe if I wear them for awhile, but everyone's head is different. For the price, these are really a deal."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for my 8 year old and he loves them and says they feel great. And they also sound really good I think. I was impressed considering how inexpensive they were.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We have bought a few Ailihen and liked them. We have small children, so we tend to replace them after they break them. Cheap enough, but good quality."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is very comfortable. I enjoy the fact they can collapse for storage. The sound is really good and so far this is the longest lasting pair I've had in this price range.I went through three pairs of different brand headphones in the last few months (most not even lasting a month), and I've been most satisfied with this one. The braided cord is a nice feature."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my 8 year old daughter. They are really nice! The quality is great. We were a little skeptical because they have a lot of Chinese writing on them. The cord isn't plastic, it is a rope material and the ear pieces are comfortable and have great sound."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these headphones! Great price! The work better than I expected. The sound is clear, vibrant, and the base is audible. They are also very comfortable and can be modified easily to fit your head. These headphones also come with a long chord, which makes them more comfortable and convenient as well. They also include a coupon along with the package just for making a purchase! I can't get enough of them!"

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These appear to be pretty nice headphones, I bought them for my 6 year old for school (they require each student to provide their own headphones for ipads) this is his 2 nd pair. They are sent home frequently because the ear pad ""comes off"" and they are sent home for me to repair. So the low price equals falls apart & frustration for my 6 year old. Luckily the fix is easy."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Item actually came early. Packaged very well and work perfectly. They are a little tight on an adult head but I imagine they will stretch out a bit. Love the leather. I have allergies to different synthetic materials and these don't bother my face or ears at all. The cord is covered (like a shoe string) which is a great feature that I haven't seen before in headphones. No more bent, frayed spots in the wire. The color is vibrant and beautiful. I think my daughter wants to swipe them but I'll just have to get her a pair. I like mine!"

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,The first time our seven year old daughter used this the ear padding fell off.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for my son's birthday he ain't heard me talk sense
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I honestly love these. They're really comfortable, the sound is clean, definitely worth the price. I like the braided cord, hoping it will help the headphones last longer. I took off a star because the ear pads were a bit smaller than I thought they'd be. It's not a problem for me since I'm only 5 feet tall but I wouldn't buy these for my partner who is 6 feet tall. Seems best suited for children and small adults. I saw another review that talked about how uncomfortable these were for them but I haven't had any discomfort and have been able to wear them for extended periods of time. However, as I mentioned, they are a bit on the smaller side and I could see how they may cause discomfort if the fit isn't right. I don't know that I'd go as far as to say that these are noise canceling headphones. They do muffle surrounding sounds and you can definitely turn up the volume to drown anything else out but they're not going to give you the same noise canceling as the more expensive headphone brands. Overall, I'm really happy with them and would recommend them to children, teens, and small adults."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound for the cost. My only complaint is that they stiff and can be a bit uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. However, they isolate outside sounds pretty well for headphones in this price range. Overall I'm very satisfied. They arrived quickly the color is just as pictured and is super cute and they extend easily (for those us with larger heads). Hopefully they become more comfortable with wear."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to wait a few months before I write an honest review. We have had these headphones for roughly 7 months now and I have purchased more expensive headphones for my children at big box stores; however, these have held up the best. No exposed wires and are hardly showing anywhere and tear at all. Best part is they are really comfortable and cover the entire ear. Everyone in the house, adults included, fight over these headphones. I will be buying a few more pairs."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone was lightweight and foldable (making it easy to throw into our travel bag). It fit my daughter's head and ears comfortably (6 years old). The added sound button on the cord was a nice addition. Both children were quiet the whole way (all 8 hours). I'm hoping they hold up all year long. So far, I am really pleased."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick service, comfy fit (I have a small head and many headphones just fall off) and they block out other noise effectively. Sound quality if also very good!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,for the price of this product it exceeds my expectations.The connection chord and comfort of the head pads are great quality. Really nice headphones.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids absolutely love this headphone. Like all headphones, they do start to hurt your ear, but overall...it's a great product. I have tried it and you can even talk on the phone while wearing this headphone. It has a built in speaker/microphone on the cord. Sound is very clear."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is great! And the mic is higher up than my last pair so I don't have to hold the cord while talking on the phone so that's a huge plus. I have a smaller head so many headphones like this don't fit my head but this one is perfect!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Received a day earlier then expected. Then headphones a good buy for less than $20. The fit comfortably and are stylist to boot. The plug is right angled which is a plus and the cord is braided which I also like. In my opinion for the price these would be hard to beat!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with these headphones. Colors are vibrant and the sound is clear. Love the fact that these headphones also have a microphone which works perfectly with my iPhone.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Okay sound for the price but the quality is lacking. These worked great after four months of daily use. The sound would then begin to cut out occasionally. The headphones were trashed on month five after one headphone went out completely.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were a gift to a 9-year old and an eleven-year old child. As with most accessories these headphones will be subject to abuse and use that no adult can imagine. I will revise this review after one month. IF the headphones survive the month I will consider purchasing more.

It is light, adjustable, attractive, and does what it should and does it well. While I bought it mostly to talk on Skype or to my computer it has very good sound with music. It seems to be made from good quality materials and is comfortable to wear. Also the seller was helpful with the question I had. I would buy it again. Lewis"

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick delivery and exact product info
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this item at two separate times. The first set broke last year by accident, (around 7 months) so it appeared. Got the replacement as a Christmas present, and in less than two months, it snapped easily. The future of online shopping has to be/have some type of quality control. Our hubris and longing for convenience, has made us prisoners of technology. Our frustration with human behavior has led to this convenient automation, but to what end? Anyway, buyer beware! As a product 2 stars. Two pairs snapping in less than a year is enough."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,love them- fits and sounds great
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. This is a Christmas present for my brother. When I first pulled it out of the box there is a picture of a green pair of headphones and I immediately thought that I was going to have to send them back. Then I opened the box and sure enough they are orange! I love it, I hope it tricks my brother too! I mainly just really hope that they work so we shall see."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them..
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They have really good sound and I love the color. I love how it has a braided cord because I prone to break wires easily. The only problem is that since I wear glasses the padding makes it uncomfortable because its pressing on my glasses. So the problem is from me wearing glasses and there's nothing wrong with the headphones. Just a caution for those who wear glasses.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ""button"" on the cord does something weird to the sound. I can not hear anything, its like the sound is really far away. If I depress the button, problem solved. I should exchange them and see if its a defective button, but I just used a piece of tape to ""depress"" the button - problem solved."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought a pair for myself and my daughter. Only one side works on mine. My daughter says hers are intermittent. Sometimes both sides work and sometimes only one side works. Very disappointed in this product.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I saw the good reviews so I thought I would buy some for my sons. The audio quality was OK for their short lives of a couple days. My sons destroyed the three of these I bought. They are VERY cheaply made. Ear cups fell off and chords easily ripped out making them useless. Don't expect these to last long. They were a waste of money and I highly regret my purchase.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for my 12-year old. The color is beautiful. My daughter loves the pause button and she finds it very comfortable. I like the folding ability. It makes storing and traveling with them so much easier. We only got it recently, so we can't comment on durability but we're happy so far."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My 9-year-old girl doesn't like them. She says they don't fit well on her head. I won't buy anything by this brand again.

UPDATE: ReviewMeta says the reviews for this product FAIL its testing system. That means a majority of them are fake. Buyer beware."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is way too long. I'm 5'5"" and my phone can be flat on the ground and the headphones are still on my ears. Also the music is slightly muffled. But they work for the gym. I'm gonna have to find something to do with the extensive cord."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked for the first time and then promptly bent and the end of the jack broke off into my tablet as we were pulling it out and couldn't be fixed. I ended up having to get a replacement tablet, thankfully I had an extended service plan with it that helped cover the cost.

Update: customer service promptly contacted me and offered resolution in form of new set or refund and also offering to pay for the tablet repair ( which was not necessary). I would deal with them again"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Advertised as over-ear headphones, but are actually on-ear headphones. I liked the idea of foldable over-ear headphones, but upon arrival I quickly saw the product was smaller than expected, barely fitting my head, and the earpass sitting on my ears. As such, for an adult these are definitely not over-ear headphones! For kids they may be...

I returned the product because after wearing them for 30 minutes my ears hurt a lot. I wear glasses and this product made me very aware of that.

Great headphones for kids, not for adults. These are NOT over-ear, so misadvertised!!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This didn't even last 90 days and the electronic wires are exposed on the mute button on the cord. The plastic piece covering them came off and all the circuits are exposed. Seems VERY dangerous for a kid product. My child uses these sitting calmly on the couch, in full view of adults, and the product has not been misused. I want to return it but it looks like this item has been taken down - likely for the same issue."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"your ears would have to be one inch long to fit inside these as you would assume if you used these kinds of headphone berfore. so maybe these are little kids headphones? not for adults, but I dont feel like returning them and looking again, so I'll keep them as they dont hurt my ears."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these because of the many great reviews for my 11 yr old daughter. She used it to watch videos for homeschool and occasional YouTube videos. Within 6 months, the wire connecting the headphones became jiggly and headphones went out on both ears. I am really disappointed because she really takes care of the things she has and never leaves them around the house. I would have been fine if they lasted a couple of years for the money we paid."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones. Sound quality is not the best but good for the price. They block out a good amount if noise, but not all of it. I also have not noticed any sound leakage. They are a little bit large for my head, but I've got a rather small head and they are adjustable for larger head sizes. The colors are nice (I got the teal ones). The only part that seems like it may be a problem is the microphone button on the chord. The plastic seems cheap and likely to break if too much pressure is applied. Otherwise a really nice product for a good price."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is excellent, but the phones will KILL your outer ears if you wear them the wrong way. For the first week, I had to take them off every 5-10 minutes to pull and stretch my ears and alleviate the soreness. I'd tried adjusting the band and no position seemed to work well. Since there are no right and left markers, I just assumed the wired side was the right channel until i listened to a track that i knew had isolated vocals in the left channel. Turned out I had been wearing them the wrong way. Obviously, they're much more comfortable now, but Ailihen should consider at least telling people which is the left and right phone. Of course it's ultimately user error, but in the age of ignorance, they should be more proactive. :-)"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are adequate, but some sound leaks so I don't use them on my train commute. Bass becomes distorted when volume is increased. But for just going for a nice long walk these are perfect. Great fit and they don't move around. The overall sound is good. The sound doesn't have to be loud to enjoy the music. Well balanced. I like them."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,For $13 this is a great buy. The audio quality is great. The build quality is great. The phones have a nice soft feel texture and they fit nicely. The colors are fun. The 5 ft cord is a soft fabric. The ear pieces are soft and feel great on my ears. The phones come with an in-line microphone and a small button to answer incoming calls. You will get a users guide and a product warranty card.They provide customer service and a phone number to call. You have a one year limited warranty. This company is providing a very nice product and customer service. Good bass.The shipping box is perfect for storing the phones.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are beautiful, they fit great and the sound is perfect. I needed a new headset for my computer and this was exactly what I was looking for. I have trouble fitting a headset because my head is either too small for adult and too small for a youth, but these feel good and they don't hurt after wearing them for long periods of time.

Update: I am going to purchase a second set. After 2 years of very heavy use the L side broke at the pin part. My hubby tried to glue them back together, and they are working for now. I loved the fit and the sound. Where they broke is where I am constantly pulling them off. So, I think this is everyday wear and tear on them. I'm surprised they lasted as long as they have considering the abuse they have had."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love it! We needed a new set of headphones for my son. These are a favorite color of him, they feel soft and of a good quality. They don't have the strongest bass thumping abilities, but for the price point, they provide a good, rich sound. There is even decent noise isolation, not for the listener from the environment, but at moderate music levels, no sound bleeds out to the environment."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was super cute headphones and my son loved using it. He is 6 years old and it fit his head perfectly. He thought it was comfortable and it didn't slide down.

However, after 1.5 months the headphones broke. The headphones were getting maybe used 3x a week for 10 minutes."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter tends to really go through headphones - she's rough on them. Part of the issue is she tends to fiddle with the cords when using them - twisting, bending, etc. and then she ends up losing sound quality or one speaker quits entirely. These are holding up great though! There is only one cord going to one side, with the wires to the other speaker embedded in the part that holds them on your head/ears. The cord is also thick and seemingly wraps the wires better so less likely to break. She also finds the sound quality to be very good and she's picky about that. They're also comfortable and quite cute (she has the hot pink and black ones)."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter is digging these over the ear, lightweight, foldable headphones. They have a fun range of colors and don't squeeze too tightly, which is a huge deal breaker for my 12yo. These are a great size for younger kids and tweens who are too old for big, babyish looking headphones.
PROS:
1. Ergonomic Design For Comfort
2. Excellent Noise-cancelling
3. Easy controls
CONS:
We haven't had any problems with them yet.

These are soft and comfortable and have decent sound for the price. We tried them with Android Phones and iPhones and they worked fine, though my daughter rarely uses them on phone calls. She does play her phone music through them constantly. I was given a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own. Recommended."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my daughters iPod. She loves them. They are a great fit around her head, compact nicely to fit in a drawer, made of a sturdy material and she loves the turquoise-lavender color I ordered for her. It also comes with a built in microphone that she uses for voice memos. This was a good purchase!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my son to use with his iPad and they are working great. These replaced a similarly priced pair of Skullcandy headphones that frequently got tangled up and did not have any controls on the line. This pair has yet to have the tangling problem after a couple weeks of constant use and the folding makes them much easier to store and transport. He has found this pair much more comfortable and they do a great job in blocking out noise around him, his mother and I included. :)"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The green color is so beautiful. Ergonomic design make It comfortable to wear, with excellent noise-cancelling function. Folding design make it convenient to carry."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones' body has great build quality, especially for the price! Very compact design that fits snugly but comfortably on the head and ears. The reason I gave it 3/5 stars is because the audio is VERY bass-y, which makes it very distracting. Some things sound muffled because of it. I really wish the audio was better, but I can't complain because I had a low budget for a new pair of headphones."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad for the price. They do look a bit small, almost like child size headphones, but fit my big head perfectly fine. They also deliver great sound and bass. Definitely surprising."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just returned a very expensive pair of Sennheiser headphones because the sound did not justify the price. Decided to go less expensive and give these a try. Quite impressed! Glad I made the switch!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible! They hurt my ears terribly. Sound is just alright. Not bad for the price. Gave them to a friend; didn't bother his ears. Could just be me.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased as a gift for my children and they absolutely love them. They were reasonably priced and I won't have a fit if I have to buy new ones.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones! Just got them today for my son, but will be ordering a 2nd pair for myself. They come packed in a nice, sturdy box. I also like how the cord comes wrapped with fabric so it doesn't get tangled!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,It broke after just a month of usage. Not great quality.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine may have been faulty. I bought these to run with and immediately had issues with the sound cutting out and constantly had to adjust the cable. Then, it seems to be triggering some sort of voice control and stopping my music. I tried it with Pandora, Amazon music, and just my iPod, and each time it would automatically pause my music and cue voice control. No matter how much I played around with them, it didn't help. Needless to say, they're in the garbage."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic, the sound is awesome for the price. These are not that different then the Bose headphones that cost $200...I should know I have three of their sets. I also have the Skull wired and Blue tooth. These are right up there for a fraction of the price, I have hearing loss but with these I don't need my hearing aids to hear the music...most headphones don't go loud enough for me. Had a co worker show me these and I was on the net in five minutes to order me a pair. They seem to have a canceling effect too.

Just got them today and fantastic."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really cute- I bought them for the gym. However, I won't be able to take them to the gym. The first time I plugged them into my phone, the connection is bad and if you move it at all the sound goes out. Wiggling it helps half the time. Or the other half causes an extremely annoying amount of static."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchase 2 months ago and the left speaker has already stopped Working. No response from the ""service"" email address that supposedly handles the repair/replacement. Not worth it."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Barely used the headphones, bought them to be used at my desk to edit and took them up one morning and slid over my ear, went to adjust one of the headphones and it came off in my hand. Tried contacting their customer service about their warranty and got no response"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,The padding for one of the headphones broke within a couple of weeks of use - so basically have to throw it away. Never going to buy them again!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived on time........very well packaged...........color exactly as pictured..........directions clear & concise.........comfortable on ear.........easy to adjust.........good sound quality for the price.........pleased with purchase.........would recommend........
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very very cute. Sound quality is good as well, for the price, but they could use some stronger bass for sure. Again, you get what you pay for, and im mostly content. They do hurt after long wear, but...I guess I'll just deal with it lol"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,EARPHONES ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THEY ARE VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMFORTABLE TO WEAR FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike what they claim, these are not over-the-ear but rather on-the-ear headphones. They might have been fine if I didn't have to wear glasses, but they pinch after more than 30mins of use.

Ended up returning these and buying a $20 pair of over-the-ear headphones from Walmart."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,They are pretty and comfortable. There is no manual and website is all in japenese. The device is unrecognizable on a regular computer so if you plan on using them as a mic on computer then dont buy them. So I can't use these for the new reading program I got them for.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband tried his and said the sound was very good. I like that they are light weight and will pack well on our trip to China.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves her set... She wears them every where with no complaints about ear or head fatigue...
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved them at first, sound quality is good. Got 2 pairs. Colors perfect! Unfortunately at just under a month, on both pairs the padding on the ear part came off and now can't be used without hurting the ear. They were constantly being folded up and Tucktaway in a case and the padding still came off."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for our 7 year olds head. The ear buds are too big, but these were perfect"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter was extremely excited and happy with these headphones, but she did not get to use them for very long. The part that you insert into the device to listen - broke off into her phone :("
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,The range is very limited. poor bass. I returned it and spent a few more dollars and got a much better one.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,These didn't last... My son had them for about 2 months and they died. Two stars only because he got a few months out of them
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work well, but too small for adults"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is clear and the construction is good quality
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved by a tween.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for the few months they stayed together. Good sound and doubled as my xbox one headset. Sadly the left headphone broke at the hinge and can't be fixed. Good for the price but like most cheap headphones they break after a while.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound but a little bit tight to fit in my head.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,My 10 year old wore these one time and the ear piece broke off. And she is pretty gentle with her her things. She was super sad!
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the best quality, especially for little ones. The ear cushion comes off easily and can not be replaced once off."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for headphones that cup your ears entirely, you are looking at the wrong product.

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones broke after less than two months. Wish I could return or exchange for new ones. Not a low price either..
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't expect much for the price but these suck! Feel very cheaply made don't sound good and there's a buzzing noise when i try to use them. Spend the money buy a better pair you get what you paid for.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,If placed fully in the port you cannot hear from both headphones. You can only hear sounds from both headphones if the cable is partially in the port.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They work pretty well and are really cute. For whatever reason the way the ear pieces are shaped they hurt my ears. I can wear them for half an hour before my ears start hurting really bad. They don't cover the entire ear and have a lot of pressure points. I don't have large ears, so I don't know why these fit the way they do."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, really wanted to like these headphones. They are exceptionally cute, have a woven cord, comfy earmuffs, and were a great price. I was't expecting top dollar sound out of the headphones, but the music quality was fine. Unfortunately after my first hour wearing the headphones there was a fuzzy, white noise-like sound coming out of the speaker furthest from the cord. The sound comes out whether the headphones are plugged into my computer, phone or anything else.

I'm not sure if I got a bad set, but I'm going to try and exchange these for a different pair because I did like the look and the sound before the fuzzy noise took over, and it was just fine for the price."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research to find headphones for iPhone that had a microphone. I am on the phone all the time and hate Bluetooth and hate earbuds. These are somewhat comfortable, if you only use them for a short time. They are probably okay for just listening to things but horrible to use for calling because there is static sound and if I turn the volume down due to a loud talker, then the person says they cannot hear me. I also found that my music and voice controls would randomly come on when I plugged the headphones in. I am back to square one, finding decent headphones to use for making phone calls on an iPhone 6."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE DECEMBER 6th, my birthday,
only a month in and the earpiece on the wired side snapped off. That made them totally unusable so they were filed away in the waste basket. being the holidays I have no money to buy another...NO THANKS Ailihen

I have enjoyed these for almost 2 weeks and they are still working fine ( I can even sleep comfortably in them). I am not sure what that button is for on the cord but since I don't need it that is just forgotten. For this price I will buy another if it lasts at least 6 months..."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were a gift. I have not used them.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these headphones for a while and I have to break this review up into three parts. First, they look great. I got the “light blue” or “green purple” and I absolutely love the color. To be honest, I think they should fix the listing because there could be some confusion as to what color you will be receiving despite the pictures. I personally consider them to be more of a mint green color, which I expected and wanted, but others might not.

Second, they sound pretty good as well. I’m going to be honest and say that I’m not really an audiophile, so I can’t talk about the specifics when it comes to the sound. But I think they sound really good considering the price.

Third and final, they get uncomfortable for me real quick. Like within an hour. I thought it might just be my glasses so I tried wearing the headphones without them to see if that would make a difference. Not really. They still ended up being pretty uncomfortable quicker than I would have like. I would have given them five stars if not for this.

I do like these headphones, but I don’t think I will be using these much longer. Other people say that they are very comfortable for them, so I guess they just aren’t for me, which is very unfortunate because I really liked everything else about them."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this Ailihen I35 stereo lightweight foldable headphones adjustable headband for my daughter. I super love the color combination. It is super cute! I have 3 children with different ages and different taste but they all like to listen to music and watch movies so I got them headphone to resolve this issue and to give me peace. Now everyone can listen and watch whatever they want without bothering each other. The super cute design makes it comfortable to wear it even for long periods of time. The folding design makes it convenient to carry and super easy to put it away inside a purse or bag without have to be worry about them breaking. The genuine leather earmuffs are super soft and they provide excellent noise-cancellation. It is also important that she can use it with many devices. This headphone is compatible with all 3.5mm jack devices like Android smartphones, IPhone, PC, laptop, MP3/MP4, tablet and many more. I strongly recommend this product. I would have no hesitation buying this item again or as a present for someone! [...]"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few months. Would not recommend.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought in April. Worked nicely for the first 4 months with good sound and comfort.. Beginning 4 months later in mid-August (maybe before that---have lost track of exact date) the sound would go off and on in one side and then the other side. I figured I could live with that. But yesterday September 24, the sound went off completely. I have tapped on the sides, turned my head in all kinds of directions and these headphones are d-e-a-d. I wrote the seller yesterday but have heard nothing back yet. You will like them at first but it won't last!! I have treated them carefully and stored them safely. I am the only person who uses them so I know they have NOT been handled roughly. After 4 months, I would expect a pro-rated refund or a replacement pair of headphones."

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift that I purchased for the Buxton Toybox hoping to make some kids Christmas bright.

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,This item came defective. The mic/volume control did not work. Sent back to Amazon.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable and look great. They appear very small due to their folding ability. On my head they are snug but not tight, and the on-ears cushioning does not make my ears hurt when worn for an extended period of time. When I have music playing in them they do a decent job of blocking out sound and I have to remove them to hear anyone trying to talk to me. Although many say they buy these for their kids, they certainly work for adults as long as you don't have a very large head. Only time will tell how the cord will hold up.

Pros:

*Comfortable
*Nice-Looking
*Folding, packs small
*Decent sound and sound-blocking

Cons:

*Cable is prone to tangling
*Probably too small for large adult heads"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, to start, I really like the aesthetic design of the product, which is why I bought it. Mint green is my favorite color. The braided cord was awesome, too. However, this headphones do not have an ergonomic design. They are painful to wear. They were fairly adjustable to fit any size head, but the ear muffs were too small, and I have small ears for an adult. For instance, the Sennheiser HD 202s, its earmuff is wide and egg-shaped to fit comfortably and naturally over the ear. These have a tight grip around the ears, they're small and round, and they apply a lot of pressure on the ears. You'll be in a bad mood after wearing these for an extended period of time, and you won't know why until you realize your head is being squeezed to death, and your ears are sore. The sound wasn't too great either. It sounded muffled, and slightly distorted. I really liked these headphones, but it just didn't work out."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, like most moderately priced headphones, the reviews here are mostly filled with people who received the product for free through Amazon. I hardly ever review products, but this one was so different from what I was expecting, I thought it should be noted. This is the kind of product that will do in a pinch, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Pros:
-The sound quality, while not fantastic, is pretty much what I would expect for headphones of this price. That is to say, not amazing but adequate.
-They fold up, making them slightly easier to carry than other bulky headphones I've had.
-The cord is covered in shoelace fabric and short, so it doesn't get tangled that often. I especially like the fact that it's short, since so many headphones come with five-foot or longer cords that always get tangled, caught up in everything and just look ridiculous.

Cons:
-The biggest one is how uncomfortable they are. I've tried to adjust them many times but no matter what, after about 30 minutes of wearing them (or less), I have to take them off because they become too painful to wear. The description stresses how comfortable they are twice, so this was definitely very disappointing. Even if everything else was perfect, this would be a dealbreaker for me.
-Though the sound quality is fine, they don't drown out outside noises at all. I wasn't exactly expecting noise-cancelling or anything like that at this price point, but they definitely do significantly worse in this category than others I've had.
-This seems to have subsided but when I first got them they had an unpleasant chemical smell.

I've only had them for a month so I can't speak for their durability, but I know my next pair will not be these."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used these headphones for a couple months. The sound is actually quite good. Frequency range is excellent and overall sound quality, from voice to orchestra is excellent.
The problem I have is with the comfort. After 15 to 20 minutes the spring tension holding the earpieces to the ear becomes increasingly noticeable. Some of it might be due to the angle of the earpiece which is adjustable up and down but not on the axis.
Summary - 15 minutes of use = excellent, more than that becomes barely tolerable.."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoa, these are some rubbish headphones. They fit uncomfortably on the head (I have a fairly small one), sound tinny, a nightmare to balance, even after an hour in equalizer - not worth the effort, plainly. Go with Sony or House of Marley for inexpensive headphones you actually enjoy."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a few months now and use them daily.

The headphones are beautiful and are my favorite color, and I get tons of compliments wearing them to listen to podcasts at work or even from strangers as I listen to music while walking on the sidewalk. The sound quality is also good and I feel satisfied in that regard. They don't cancel noise (not something I was looking for, but if you are, take note).

Sadly though, after wearing them for about 15 minutes at a time, my ears begin to hurt and feel strained, which eventually gives me a headache if I keep wearing them. I've tried adjusting them every way possible, with the headband looser and tighter, but nothing helps. I read in some reviews that others have this issue as well. I've had other headphones similar to these in the past, and I could wear them for hours with no problem. These just feel like they push against my ears too much."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Off the top, I'll mention that I am an audio engineer; altho I didn't buy these for professional use, just for around the yard and the gym.

the sound quality is decent/good for this price range. Also good and comparable are the $15 Amazon headphones. The Amazons are ALMOST as good sounding, and far more comfortable.

The big complaint is the fit of these headphones. They fit awkwardly on my head. They don't sit ""flush"" with my ears. It's as though the headphones aren't wide enough on their own, and when they meet my ears, they're almost bent outwards, especially the bottom halves of the cups. I almost want to pinch or bend the bottoms of the cups inward, toward me. To get them to sit more flushly on my ears, I have to extend them to the maximum height, and that leaves plenty of space between the top of my head and the headband. I have never had this problem with other cans, so I'll say that these headphones are poorly shaped. I'd be interested to know if anyone else experiences my issues with them too. These are definitely not comfortable for that reason. The Amazon Basics are a better buy."

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thinking it had volume control. I like them but I am thinking of returning them . I wanted the headphones just for listening to music while walking but that can't happen without being able to adjust the volume. Being able to skip a song is nice and the sound seems pretty good-BUT I can't believe there is no way to control the volume. It's annoying walking in the winter cold and having to pull gloves off ,unzip jacket to get at my Ipod when ever I need to make a volume adjustment. Some other review said the volume control didn't work on theirs. Am I missing something?"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for our 9 year old daughter so she can play Undertale and the rest of the house doesn't have to hear it! They held up well for two months. They were comfy on her ears and she loved the colors. However the padding slipped off one of the ear pieces and although I have looked and looked, I can't find a way to re-attach it. As such, they are useless now. =( Bummed."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Right now, I'm burning them in, but from first sound, I was actually pretty impressed. I have a pair of Audio Technical ATH-m50s, for true audiophile listening, and I wanted another pair for casual use. These do not disappoint! The colors are bright, which I wasn't sure of at first, but they're growing on me. They are pretty solidly constructed, better than I thought. The pads fit my ears perfectly, but let me note here that I do have small ears. They cancel noise well, just because they fit snugly. I mainly choose these because the plug in is angled. Straight plugs tend to get broken fairly quickly. Eager to see how these pan out. So far, so good!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars," Additionally, just wanted to make sure everyone is aware that I got these headphones at a reduced price in exchange for this unbiased and honest review of this product, and that, that has not effected this review at all. I'm brutally honest so you can trust this review is 100% truthful.

I honestly wanted to love these headphones, but the only thing holding me back from 5 stars is pretty important. These hurt my ears after about an hour. They are just too small around (the circles land on my ears and push them down); therefore, after about an hour my ears are aching. This might not be a big deal to you if you don't wear them along time or if your ears are VERY small, but I have average ears and these just hurt. I love to wear headphones for hours and listen to music while I work and I just can't do that with these without an earache and headache. If they didn't squeeze onto your head that could be prevented, but the slight ""squeeze"" could be a great thing if you're just using them for a quick run or something.

I'm not saying these are any different than most headphones – a lot are exactly like this size and squeeze and I've had other headphones with the same problem, it just makes not love them. I think the solution is to have some with larger circles that completely cover the ears, or have softer ear pads — these are fairly firm. Also the photo they give makes these look like the ear covers are bigger than they actually are.

QUALITY: these are actually EXCELLENT quality for the price. It's very hard to find affordable headphones that are this good of quality and even stylish. the material all over the headphones is soft and smooth with a matte appearance. The plastic is even soft and high-quality. I love that the cord has a protective rope around it! That's great because a lot of time the first thing to fail in headphones is the cord. I dont see having that problem with these. Some of the materials you can tell are slightly cheaper— but that's what you get for the price, and these do a good job of having better quality material where it's really needed.

FUNCTIONALITY: The sound is EXCELLENT in these and that's what makes be keep wanting to wear these even when my ears get sore. Even better, I love the microphone so I can use these to make calls and talk on the phone and can hear the person on the line amazingly. Another great benefit is the option to be able to adjust the ear positioning in and out based on your head size. I have a big head so that's great. Also you can fold these up pretty well as the ears fold into the center, making it great for transportation and travel. These are also VERY light. Much lighter than I expected them to be based on the photo. That could be because of cheaper material used or for better functionality — I'm not sure, but I like the lightness. I REALLY JUST WISH THE EAR COVERS WERE BIGGER / cushier.

STYLE: I think these are so cute and fashionable!!! The various colors to choose from is great. Not a fan of some of the other colors like the light ""tealish"" one, but these pink and black ones are perfect. I like that these have a similar design to other popular headphones.

PACKING: Awesome, professional packaging. These really do seam very expensive in every way, even the packaging was impressive for the price. They even include a warranty card with this purchase.

Any questions? Feel free to ask."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a cute headset. I have a small head for an adult (I have to wear children's eyeglasses so they don't fall off my face) The earpads are cushy, but after wearing for an extended period of time, they hurt my earlobes. I love the braided cord and how they fold up. The biggest drawback of these headphones: No volume control. I prefer having a volume control on the headset."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones as part of the back-to-school essentials for my daughter, as the school will be using iPads for Reading and Math, and they are terrific. The main focus of buying over-the-ear headphones as opposed to earbuds is that they are less irritating to wear for longer periods of time, and the sound is generally a better (blocks out background noise better). These headphones were able to adjust to fit her tiny head without a problem, and the padding is so comfortable that we have gotten zero complaints! This is the most important part to me, because if she is comfortable than she is learning more effectively. The sound is more important to her and my husband, and it is great through the speakers. It definitely makes you feel like you are in your own little world with these on.
The fold-able aspect of the headphones appealed to us as well, so that they can fit easily into smaller compartments of her backpack instead of the main pocket where they stand more of a chance of being smashed. Also, the cord is very sturdy and looks like it will wear very well. No cracks or broken wires to worry about here."

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work very well with my iphone. I received two calls and the sound clarity was excellent. The caller didn't even notice that I was talking through the headphones. They did feel a bit tight on my ears but I am sure with more use they will loosen up.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these for my 8 yr old. Light weight and foldable. Sturdy cord and love the bright colors. Bought a different pair and someone else bought me these for my daughter. Liked them so much I returned the other headphones to get these for my son.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my son and he loves them. Great overall product! I like the folding feature (makes these easy to bring with us when we are out and about) and the flexible cord seems like it will stand up to wear and tear really well.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I bought these a few months after I saw them and they work perfectly.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,It stopped working on my tablet and the mic broke off a little after a month of receiving it.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got it, it seemed durable and was incredibly comfortable for its price. It was working fine until today. I was taking it off and all the sudden one of the headphones fell off. In reality, It wasn't as durable as I thought it was ( I thought it would last at least 6 months with incredible care.) I only used these for during work and never took them anywhere else. Really random that it decided to break.

I would give it 5 stars, but its not that durable and only lasted a month even though I gave it really careful care and only kept it by my desk and used it there. Maybe I just got unlucky with my product."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think these headphone would be more suitable for someone with a small head or for children. They do adjust and although I have a larger head they fit comfortably but my earlobes due hang out. I have trouble wearing earbuds due to piercings but I don't have any problem with these headphones. The ear covers are very well cushioned . I like how light weight they are. It almost feels like I am not wearing anything at all. I like to take them with me when I have to go to the doctor. I can watch a movie or listen to music without disrupting anyone else and also drown them out.
Both movies and music are crystal clear without any annoying background static that I have experienced with other head phones. I like that the cable has cloth over it to keep it from being damaged as easily. However it does not stop them from getting tangled. They work well with my laptop, kindle, and Samsung galaxy s5. They do not have a bass boost but they do still have very adequate bass for such a light weight set. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a less expensive pair for travel.
Disclaimer I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Zero noise cancellation. Person next to you can clearly hear what conversation is going on if you are on the call and using these headphones!
I am not satisfied."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I would not recommend this product if you have a standard audio jack out put. The sound quality was poor on devices that didn't support both audio input and output on the same jack. However if you have a smart phone or tablet then this will work just fine. Also if you have a big head don't buy is product as I could not get it fit around my head even with the adjustment tabs on the head set.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved these at first sight. Cute colors for kids. Bought for my 4 year old; however, I think I might keep them for myself. Sound quality is good. Love the braided cord. Also like that it is connected to only one ear piece. My daughter seems to destroy headphones after only a week or two of use. Have only had this pair for a week but have been durable so far. Will update review after a month or sooner if something happens."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spend my evening unwinding, usually on the internet, before I fall asleep. I don't listen to anything because I don't want to wake my husband, who has to get up very early in the morning for work. So I have started using headphones lately, I just can't use the little in the ear ones because leaning on my pillow on my side ends up pushing on them and they make my ears sore. These headphones are really cushiony so I started using them so I can listen to calming music before I sleep. Last night I put them on and within 20 minutes I was able to get sleepy enough to actually sleep. The headphone quality is really nice, I don't really need to fold them, but they fold just fine without bending on the wires. They fit on your head very nicely, go over the ear comfortably and have great sound quality. My daughter keeps wanting to snag them because they are so cute too, the pink and black make a pretty combination.

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these a lot. I actually have no complaints. I think for the price you pay they sound great and look really nice. The color is vibrant and beautiful and they are nicely padded for comfort. The cord it's covered in durable rope like material and is really sturdy plus they fold up to be compact. I think these are great quality for a low price, they came in a day ahead of time and I would definitely buy again."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these headphones are amazingly good. Spent the afternoon walking around the neighborhood with them, listening to Pandora and my own MP3 files. They fit me well; though I walked while using them, they were comfortable and held nicely and may have even stayed put while jogging. The ear cups are soft and don’t press on or bother my ears. The sound quality was terrific for both voice and music.

I used them for both incoming and outgoing phone calls as well as listening to my ipod and in both cases, the sound was really clear. They also cancel out a lot of noise which would be great for plane travel. Very modern/hi-tech look. Easy folding ear cups to take up minimal space.

The headband was quite comfortable to me; adjustments were easy to make and they stayed in place without any problem. The folding design make these easy to travel with.

If you are looking for a very affordable headphone option that is comfortable to wear and provides good sound quality, we totally recommend these headphones.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Review Update - May 2016
This is our second pair and I'm sad to say they broke in exactly the same place (the joint of the headband to the ear piece) My daughter loves the comfort of these and I would love to get her another pair but I refuse to purchase yet a third pair for fear that the exact same thing will happen again - had to update my review and change my 5 Stars to 3stars because of this

My 9 yr old daughter loves these - says they don't hurt her ears as others have done in past - she recently broke her pair and insisted she wanted the exact same ones to replace them"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these headphones in sea green (with purple) for my preteen daughter. She uses them with Playstation 3, Amazon Fire Tablet, PC games, and Samsung Android phone. On Android phone calls, family members can hear her loud and clear through the built in mic (better than with speakerphone), and she can hear better (and more comfortably) than holding the phone up to her ear. For pc and PS3 games we have not tested the mic function, but she can hear music and sound effects crystal clear. (And better yet, I cannot hear them at all! Yay!)

These headphones are a dream come true! They are very comfy and soft, so she can wear them for hours (and she is very particular about comfort), plus they look good (stylish and available in her favorite colors). This is one of her favorite gifts ever...and very affordable for all the functionality. I am impressed how well they work with all her electronic devices. The microphone is built in, basically just a little hole on a piece attached to the cord, so it does not get in the way and is easy to use.

One more 'comfort' item of note that my daughter loves... the cord attaches only on one side of the headphone. Usually cords attach to the product on both sides, which leads to pulling on the neck and getting tangled. These are much more free and don't have to even lay against her neck, plus they won't get caught in purse straps or power/charging cords for other devices you use with them. She also loves the soft, silky feel of the cord and also of the entire headset. It is soft feeling on the outside of even the earpieces, and even more silky and plush on the inside. She said it feels like wearing a 'cloud' on her ears.

Also I have received good follow through and customer service from the company so far.

We have been using the headphones about a week and I highly recommend them to anyone who uses electronics frequently. If you are looking for unique colorful style, plush comfort, and versatility across a variety of devices...then these headphones would be perfect for you!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a reason they only offer 3 month warranty/ the expected life is 3 months!
I purchased 2 sets of headphones. Initially out of the box I was impressed with the color and soft texture but less than 6 months later of gentle use- not even daily- neither are working correctly. On has a broken volume button with no trauma or external damage- the other only plays from one ear and when you move the wire it turns Siri on."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently had the need to get a couple good sets of headphones for my husband. One for him at work & one for hi here at home. He had a small crappy set that came with his phones that had completely stopped working due to issues with the connector & the wiring in them. We had gone through 3 sets of the small stick in the ear style in the last month because of how much he uses them & I wanted to upgrade to something a bit more substantial for him epically for work. He works on a farm & uses his smart phone not only to keep in touch with others on the farm when he is on the other side of the farm, or for music while working in the fields or in the shop. I picked up 2 sets for him, this set & the “AILIHEN C8 Lightweight Foldable Headphones” Bot sets are excellent if you ask me. This set (Ailihen 135) has the best fit of the 2 for him. The fit his head perfectly & create a nice solid seal around the ears providing excellent external noise reduction making them great for him at work. The sound quality is good, but I think the sound quality is actually a bit better on the other set (Ailihen C8) because of that they have become his “at home” set for gaming & streaming video. Both sets appear to be made with quality products & are working just as well as we had hoped. The color of this se (black & safety orange) make them perfect for work for him as the orange is very easy to spot. He has been using them 6 days a week for the past couple weeks now & so far we have had no issues with them at all & they have performed fantastically. As far as using them for hands free communication. They work so much better than the old ones he had & I have no issues at all being able to talk to him while he is on the tractor cutting a field.
Pros:
The noise canceling function on these & 360 degree pickup microphone with high-definition voice calls makes them great for using as a hands free device. These headphones are compatible with all Android phones, IOS, winphone and Blackberry system phones. End/Answer phone calls, Pause/Play music, support with switch of previous/next songs. These headphones fold up nicely so they are easy to take with you.
Cons:
I had noticed a few reviews with issues about the size & adjustability. Although my husband loves these & has no problem with the way they fit him, I can see how they might not be the perfect headphones for some. Every head (like every person) is unique. So although these may be great for most people. The low level of adjustability does not offer a comfortable fit to 100% of the people.
As far as I’m concerned, I would have no problems at all recommending these headphones to anyone looking for a good & portable set of high quality headphones.

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one for each of my granddaughters for long trip. One is 5 and one is 8. Neither had a problem with them. I put one on to see how it sounded and I had to order myself one, so I've bought 3. The sound (for me) was so clear and real. I'm 65 and I loved the clear sound. They make listening to music or watching DVDs on players (thats what my granddaughters used for). Wow, no sound out of the kids. They were entranced to what they were watching. Money well spent. And I ordered the green/purple. Love the color"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"very cheap feeling. very poor sounding.

I had a pair of Sony MDR-V150s that broke after years of use. while ordering a replacement set, these came up as an alternative... outstanding reviews, looked good. however what arrived wasn't the same. they weren't even the same brand as pictured. the color was also ""off"" more like a bright orange-yellow, not a burnt orange as the picture appears. the feel was very cheap plasticy the ear pads were a sticky plastic feel... then I pugged in, and the sound was absolute garbage, tinny, weak, static-y... returned immediately.

buy Sony MDR-V150s... they are $2 more, but will give you years of quality usage. my last pair only broke because my toddler threw them to the ground... they were 6-7 years old already, and were my primary computer headphones for that time."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While these certainly aren't the best headphones out there, they are in my opinon a really great buy. Considering they are only $20, the first great feature is their affordability. Now there are plenty of cheap headphones out there, but the problem is that most of them have poor sound quality, are uncomfortable, may irritate a part of your head or ear, not fit properly and the list can go on. While the sound quality on these certainly has room for improvement, I find the quality to be well enough for me not complain or want to put a different pair on. You can hear clearly, the sound is crisp and clear with an occasional muffled word here and there, but not enough to warrant a complaint from me or to revoke a star from its rating. I have been able to wear these for a few hours at a time before needing to give my ears a rest from them while on tv show binges. The best part is that there hardwired, which means you don't get that ever so annoying, battery low in your ear while trying to hear/listen to something, which for me, always seems to occur during a very important part of whatever I'm watching and listening to. After having used this brand myself, I have in returned purchased these in other colors for my kids to use as well.

In my opinon these are the Best Buy I've found out there as far as price to quality of sound and comfort. Really recommend these for kids, because they work well for them, but your not going to freak out if they break them because of how inexpensive they are. The fold down to making them great for traveling as well. I'm extremely happy with this initial purchase, and like I said, so much that I went ahead and purchased additional headsets for my children. I would recommend these to anyone looking at them. For the price, you just can't beat it. I did recieve these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of them. I was not paid or compensated in anyway to give my honest unbiased opinon, nor do I promote any one company, I simply like them."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound quite good and are about as noise-isolating as one can expect from on-hear headphones. The ear pads and head band are very comfortable for extended wear on my large head and have a decent range of adjustment.  THey are not for children, unless you add a pad under the head band.  They fold and store in a fairly compact package.  The microphone is a nice touch and works well, when I use them on phone calls, the other party says the sound is clear and unmuffled.  The bright colored braided cord does not tangle easily and is easy to find in a dark backpack.

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very soft and fit your ears well and don't hurt your ear. They have a nice length cord and are easy to use with any device. I like that they go to a decent volume and block out most of your other background noise. I had them on 25% with my computer/phone and couldn't hear my kids very easily who were watching TV in the same room. They are nice, sturdy, and heavy and easy to store when not in use.

The color is a nice teal and purple. I think these these headphones are comparable to others and I like them just as much as the expensive pair of Ludicris Soul headphones I own or any Beat products. All together I would recommend these earbuds to others because I think they are a pretty decent set of headphones - especially for kids who are hard on things."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To begin with this is labeled as a kids set of headphones. These headphones come in an array of colors ranging from pink, blue, black, and orange to mention a few.

The sound quality is maybe average but that can be expected for an inexpensive set of headphones. The headphones do offer a full range of sound. The bass is not very distinct but it is there none the less. The sound does come through crisp and clear to about 70% of the volume before it starts to distort. If you are picking these up for a child I do not expect them to last long because almost every kid plays the music as loud as possible.

The next feature of the mic that is included. It does offer a 360 radius. I tried these out on my mumble channel. I was heard clearly by everyone in the chat. There was not reverb or crackling noises. I did have to speak up a little bit, but I am typically a soft spoken person so that is the normal for me and headset mics.

The ear pads are semi soft. The material they are made from did start to make my ear area start to sweat some. They are soft enough to be comfortable to wear for extended periods of time as well. Across the top bar of the headphones there is also a padded portion. This is a great feature for any set of headphones. It makes slipping them on/off much easier and when you bang into something it does not feel like you have ripped off the top part of your head.

If your are looking for a beginners set of headphones with a mic this is a set you might want to consider. They are inexpensive, come in an assortment of colors, and comfortable to wear for extended lengths of time. I would like to thank Sound Intone and affiliates for sending me this set of headphones to try out. Below is a link to their website where they offer a lot more products including what looks to be better headsets as well.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE the colors and appearance! Great sound distribution.

My only complaint - the ear cups/cuffs are too small. Either, at age 56, I am learning for the first time that I have big ears or these are meant for children or adults with small ears.

Seriously, after having them on for a couple of hours while I work on the computer, either the top 1/4 or bottom 1/4 of my ear is very, very sore. This makes it hard to enjoy them for any extended period of time."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this headphones! I usually always buy cheap earphones because I always lose them but I bought this pair to use them with my electric violin and I am very pleased with their quality!
I guess because of the price I didn't have great expectations but the headphones are very well built, the cable is braided and it feels very resistant, they are pretty, they fit my head (I have kind of a big head), the sound is very very good! I tried the mic in a call and it works all right.
Maybe the only detail is that they are not light blue, they are mint. I don't mind because I like mint too."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas 2015, and she still uses them EVERY DAY. She loves them, but she is hard on her stuff and yet they have lasted! She did break the small piece on the side so I'll have to purchase a new set for this Christmas (even though they still work). Otherwise, I think they have a lot of life left."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried several different types of inexpensive-mid range headphones and these are by far my favorite out of all the ones that I've tried. Maybe more importantly though is not that they are ""better than other headphones"" but rather that as that a stand-alone product they are actually really good. They are made from good quality materials and have a good sound. This is one product that I felt like actually came and looks pretty much exactly like the picture in the product description. They are designed with cushion pretty much everywhere, so your head doesn't get pinched in weird ways that make it hurt. The earpieces (earmuffs?) are comfortable and isolate the sound pretty well. Both what you're listening to from those around you as well as the ambient noise that might bother/distract you. They fold up for storage, and fold up smoothly. Like I said before, I'm impressed. I always try to think of cons and here are my biggest three:

1.) The cable isn't detachable. It's plenty long which gives you a lot of freedom but I wish it were detachable
2.) The color is super bright. I like it a lot most of the time. . . but it definitely makes you stand out which isn't always what I'm going for.
3.) The sound is good but not so good that it blows you away

Overall I really like them and assuming that they continue to work I will definitely continue to recommend them.
I was fortunate enough to be able to review these and get a discount on the price but I give them 5 stars because I am super happy with them and think that they deserve them. I definitely don't give everything 5 stars."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My boyfriend wears this at his work. So this is more of his review than mine.

Sound quality is pretty good and the isolation pads work well, sometimes to the point where he can't hear his coworkers talking to each other (open office space).

Main issue with the pair of headphones is the pressure on the ears. Even with the comfortable ear pads. If he wears it for more than 2 hours he feels some discomfort on his ears where the headset has been sitting.

Overall, good value for the price with one downfall, could have been a 5-star otherwise."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The fit is great. Extremely comfortable on my head. I had a problem deciphering the left and right side since I found no marking on my set as indicated in the instructions. I looked everywhere. So I chose to put them on based on how they had someone wear them in the picture - meaning the left has the cord attached. Not sure if this is right or not, but that's the best I could do. The sound a good for the price. I use it to watch videos while walking my treadmill. It really helps to drown out the sound of the treadmill. I haven't used the phone/mic part since that's not why I purchased these. Giving a four star based on the lack of labeling. Otherwise this is a very decent set."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are BRIGHT orange! I mean bright, bright! I could see them from across the room as if they were glowing, and it is perfect! They also do fold up and store quite nicely, and they just feel sturdy!
My husband tried these out and they fit him fantastic, and had excellent sound quality. He also really liked that they include a microphone as he has been needing a new pair of headphones and microphone to use for them he is gaming, and these seem to be great for that, especially for the price.

PRO:
Soft! The headband feels like it has a memory foam insert inside of it, making it the softest pair of headphones we've ever owned. We can easily see ourselves wearing them for hours on end.
Lightweight, they feel good when wearing them but they also don't feel like junk, they feel sturdy.
Well packaged, the box they came in kept them very safe and secure.
Excellent fit, they are adjustable.
Comfortable!!

CON:
They are not 100% noise canceling, but they don't claim to be. While music/sound is playing, they do seem to function and be fairly noise cancelling, but you must have sound playing. When just on with a low volume, he could still hear I was saying something, but couldn't make out the words.
They are VERY bold and bright, which my husband loves but if you are after a more discrete set, these aren't them. There are softer color options available.

I did receive these at a slight discount to review them, but all thoughts and opinions and photographs are my own, and I was not bribed or given these for free, though wow would I have loved to have them for free! They really are fantastic."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"THESE ARE SO CUTE. I LOVE THE COLOR. ADJUSTABLE, DECENT SOUND, COMFORTABLE, AND THE CORD IS STURDY. THE FOLDABLE PART MAKES THEM A GOOD SIZE FOR A PURSE OR BOOKBAG.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. Small and lightweight. Not the best sound in the universe, but just fine for wearing at work when I need to drown out ambient sound. The microphone is a bonus but also very clear. These get light use and are stored at work, so not tossed around in a bag all the time."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Midtones have been flattened a bit so as to provide rich clear bass with a nice hum. However the mid to upper end range and clarity suffer slightly. My husband gives them a 5/5 because they hit the sound range that he enjoys. The color was true to image much to my delight (I love bright colors). They are surprisingly light weight while feeling sturdy and I would not worry about dropping them or tossing them in my work bag. They may not fit in small purses even in the folded up position. Large bag carriers fear not! :-)

I will report back if there are any changes, but I would purchase these again and my husband is subtly hinting at how nice the black and orange pair look."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would lay claim to these, but my 5yo and wife took them over, and I never got much chance to use them. This review is from their perspective!

Comfort: 5/5
The 5yo wore them for 2 hours straight listening to an audiobook (Ramona the Pest, if you're curious) on a long car ride. His ears were red from having 'phones on for hours, but he didn't complain about them hurting.

Controls: 5/5
So easy a 5 year old can use them. Literally. It just took one explanation, and he was able to control it easily. The headphones interfaced with the iPad (what he used them with) to watch TV and to listen to an audiobook easily.

Sound Quality: 4/5
These aren't Bose, but they're very good. I reviewed another set of headphones recently, and these are WAY better on bass; and the high end isn't tinny or flat. The midrange is good, too. I was pleasantly surprised.

Appearance: 5/5
These look pretty slick. The orange is ""construction cone orange"" - very bright.

Convenience/Folding: 2/5
These ""fold"" in, but not much. The total size is only reduced like 30%. If being able to fold headphones down to a pocket size is important to you, get something smaller and better at folding. These wouldn't even fit in a winter coat pocket.

Durability: 5/5
These were kicked around by a toddler, baby, and used every day by a preschooler. They were shoved in an over-packed car twice and made it out alive. They took a beating and were unfazed. They FEEL pretty tough, too. They stood up to high winds, sand, and wet hair at the beach pretty well. Oh, and the jack is an L-shaped jack, which is safer for your device if the headphones get yanked on. That's another huge pro for giving them to a five year old.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I spent a week testing them at the beach in the outer banks, just to report back on them."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ailhen i135 stereo lightweight foldable headphones rock! I got these and I was so excited about the color most of all. How often do you see a pair of headphones that has this type of color, it is very rare. I really love the way these are made and I was truly impressed with the craftsmanship. These are no cheap pair of headphones but there was some serious time and thought that went into designing these just perfectly. They are foldable, which of coarse is one of the greatest features. You really need to have them foldable now and days because they will break and once that happens they are pretty much worthless. These do not have that issue at all, because they are fordable you can pretty much fit them where ever you need to without breaking or cracking them. They are very comfortable and I could wear these for extended periods of time without irritation. Disclaimer, I purchased these headphones with a promotional voucher for a fair and unbiased opinion. Everything expressed in this review is based off my experience using the product."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"at first the reason why I love the headphone is because its not bulky. these type of headphone is really awesome. And also the color I got oh my so lovely so yummy I can say because it really looks like a candy. Which is really cool because my daughter really loves it. Its so very very light in weight and comfortable to wear. And the headphone are fold in to save space and the headset is nice and padded which your ear will never get hurt not unlike other headphones out in the market as soon as you wearing it for an hour or two your ear starts to hurt and ache. There is a pause button on the cord, that allows you to stop the music. The packaging is quite nice, plastic case with a solid cardboard box and also included by the instructions. And I am blessed that I was given the opportunity to received the product at discounted price in return of my honest opinion and review and as soon as I received it we did give a shot. And I can say that this is really awesome at all. The quality is really high. And the volume is really in good shape. And I can definitely say that the headphones are compatible with all android phones and iphones since we carry both type of phones and we did try it. And it work out good without any flaws at all. Highly Recommended for me."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure yet they are wrapped up under the Xmas tree, they are going to be a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter will let you know as soon as she uses them!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I honestly wasn't expecting very much in the line of build or sound quality, but I was very pleasantly surprised on both accounts. First of all, the accent color on these is closer to pink than the advertised purple, but I like it regardless. Also, these are ""on the ear"", not ""surrounding the ear"", but I found them to be extremely comfortable, even with my chronic daily migraines. The head band is fully padded for comfort, and the braided line is a nice feature. While these don't fully block external noises, they block them enough to where you can't hear them while listening to your own music through the headphones. The microphone is a nice feature as well. My husband used these in place of his $100 gaming headphones the other night and said they sounded really good. He said he didn't get any crazy feedback on them either. Another great feature is that these fold up for easy transport. Are they as good as Bose or Beats? No, but if you're comparing quality to price, these are the much better value."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter as a birthday present. I tried them after she raved about the comfort and awesome sound quality. She was right! They are great! I bought a second pair for myself!
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the sound from these headsets. They also work well for cell phone calls. However the pins that let the speakers fold inwards broke fairly fast on the pair I got for my son. (left side first and the right side a couple weeks later) However I was able to easily drill a hole all the way through and put in a metal pin (from a paper clip) and that worked great. He is still using them and loves them.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome! I got a pair for my son (green and grey, his favorite colors!) He uses them with his DS and his Tablet. The foam cushion makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. They adjust to fit his head (or mine if I borrow them.) The cord is plenty long enough to allow freedom of movement without getting tangled. They block out a lot of environmental noise, making it easy to hear without having to crank up the volume to a high level. Overall we are very pleased with the quality and the price!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this and it came 2 days after. I bought for my kids to enjoy it. I love the color of the headphone. It is absolutely darling though I know it is for my kids use. I love that this is designed for kids because I don’t want them to use the headphone intended for adult it might cause damage to their eardrums. I love this earphone. You can have a clear, crisp, and good looking headphone for a fraction of the cost that the market out there. Headphone can cost you an arm and leg. I love my purchase. My kids love it and I love it too.
I received a discount to test and write a review about this product. I am not compensated to write a review in favor of the seller. I use my own judgment, opinion, and own words to review this product as accurate as I can. Bear in my mind that my experience might not be the same as yours."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchase this set of headphones add a promotional discounted rate for testing and review. This is a great quality set of headphones and they sound just as good as they look. I love the color and the color you receive is very true to the color you see on your monitor when ordering from Amazon. My favorite part is that it has a built in microphone So if you're listening to music you don't have to turn off or unplug your headphones you can just answer your phone and talk straight from there. I also love that they are foldable so you can easily put them into your backpack or bag and take them with you. Another great quality on this set of headphones is that the cord is wrapped in fabric so they will not bend and cracked like cheap apple headphones. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this set of headphones to anyone in the market for a new set of headphones.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First impression was they looked sharp for the price paid. They felt nice on the head, not too loose and not too tight. The braided cloth covered cord was a nice touch. Plugged them in and it all started to head south. I made sure the EQ on the playback device was set to flat. The headphones sounds is just incredibly dull and lifeless. I compared them to another pair of inexpensive headphones I have on hand that sell for basically they same price and the sound quality difference was simply startling."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones. I got them on a lightning sale so for the price paid all the better. Still, I also have the Amazon Basics headphones and these have a better louder sound. I am surprised how much I appreciate the microphone and use these all the time for cell calls--here I thought the microphone was something I'd just have to ""accept"" with the good price and not use it. Turns out to be great feature. Now, about the manufacturer: excellent customer service. I had a problem whereby a particularly hard yank on the cord dislodged it from the headphones and they were dead. I contacted Ailihen and with just a photo sent of the damage they expedited a replacement to me. Very appreciative, very satisfied. Would definitely buy from them again."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE
My niece has used these four about 4 months and recently she said that one side of the headphones no longer produced sound. I felt so bad because she loves these headphones so I contacted the company and not only were they quick to respond but they offered me a replacement. such great customer service.

I bought these for my niece and she was so happy. Loved the color and sound quality plus the fit is perfect for kids."

I THINK THE DESIGN FOR PERFORMANCE & COMFORT WAS THOUGHT OUT VERY WELL. THEY MET MY EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SIMPLE TO USE. I JUST PLUG THEM INTO MY TABLET AND IM ON MY WAY.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 9 year old. She says they are extremely comfortable and have good sound. The first pair I bought ended up having a problem with the jack. I contacted the company and had incredible and prompt response from them. They have a 12 month warranty and offered me an immediate replacement without ANY hassle or extra shipping fees. This will be our ""go to"" headphone source if ever we are in need again."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for myself initially, when they popped up for a ""Deal of the Day"". Seemed very reasonably priced, and I just wanted a spare set of headphones. They arrived in 2 days with Prime. When I opened the box, I knew I was going to have to give these to my one Grandson, who is an Orioles fan, due to the orange & black colors.

He loves them. They seem really nice for the price, and comfortable to wear.

As a bonus, they work with his tablet and phone, but also on his Xbox One console. So, these were a hit, and I still need to get a pair for myself again."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter saw these head phones and immediately said ""Can we get them????"" She was SO excited when they were delivered and immediately wanted to try them. She used them for a while and then told me ""Mommy! You need to leave an awesome review for these headphones!!!"" So here goes! They are a very cute color - a very popular color with my 11 year old. She said they worked great - great sound! She also loved the fact that they were able to be folded down and were very light weight. They fit her head very well. I think these are a great alternative to ear buds - which my kids really don't like at all. They are always complaining that they hurt their ears. All in all - great pair of headphones at a great price!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were packaged well. They fold so they aren't so bulky. The color is more a baby aqua color not baby blue. It's a gorgeous color with soft purple accents. The ear pads are very comfortable. The sound is really nice! Better than ear buds, I think. They are wired and the cord is a nice nylon braided cord. I did have a problem with one of the ear pieces stopped playing music. I fixed the cord and it hasn't happened again. I use it for phone calls which work great for that purpose too. There is a controller on the cord, but for me it is too high, I would prefer it to be further down the cord. Cord length is great. I would recommend to others."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not pleased. :( They're really nice looking and seem well made. However, my daughter (8 yrs) finds them uncomfortable because they're too tight. They hurt her ears. No way to adjust that setting. Even in the picture, you can tell how far inward the ear pieces go."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I typed in ""toddler headphones"" these came up as one of the first pair. They are a little large for a toddler and the sound is pretty loud if your toddler has access to volume button. I only bought these for a one time trip that will be over 13hrs and my child will not be able to adjust the volume. Just be cautious to not allow your child hurt their hearing with loud music or movie watching."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are perfect for my son while he does his school work! I can't get over how amazing the sound is with these headphones. The other day I used them and it was so loud I thought one of the kids had adjusted the volume on my computer, but it was only at 50%, it got me thinking, these would be great for my dad- or someone who is hard of hearing. I know my dad has a hard time finding things that will go loud enough for him to hear even on 100% volume, these would be perfect!

And they really block out all other sound really well.... great for me, but not so great when kids have them on and you're trying to get their attention! hahaha"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars," This is perfect for kids who tend to toss headphones around or lose them, but they sound pretty good for their price and light weight to wear! Don't think these will replace $50 headphones but for the price, they do fine"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a really big head and seem to always have an issue finding headphones that fit my head without breaking. Fortunately, these headphones fit the bill. The sound is really good. While you won't be blown away from the base, the sound is solid for the price. In all, I like the sound, the comfortable headphones and the cord. I got the orange ones and that's one of the things I'm not a fan of. The color is closer to neon orange than orange. While I like the round cord, I'm a bit concerned about how dirty it will become. In the end though, the comfort, price and durability beat out the downside."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered two of these in different colors for my kids to use on long car trips. They fell apart the second time my kids used them. The soft part came off of the base on both models, on the same side. I tried to fix the issue to no avail. Now I see why they were such a good deal on Prime Day."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just wow. These things feel like 50 dollar plus guys for cheap! they are sturdy and fold up and i love how the cord is made of this durable and flexible nylon material will be using these nightly !

I am very satisfied with this product.
Received for free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have regarding the product, whether it be positive or negative. My review is solely based on my experience an honest opinions. Please like my review if it helped you and hope the product works as well for you as it did for me!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! I have the teal/purple ones and they're just as stunning as they are in the picture.

And while I love the color, the more important aspect is the sound quality. I'm not necessarily an audiophile but I've run sound before and have been a performance artist so I know what is at least passable, if not excellent. I think the quality of these headphones is great! IF you're someone who is incredibly, incredibly picky about their sound quality you wouldn't be looking at these anyway. IF you're an average to above average knowledgable consumer of recordings, this will be just fine.

They are also well-built. They are sturdy and fold in for easy storage. The wire is covered in braided cloth and the ear pieces are cushy and comfortable. I highly recommend these headphones!

I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased trial and honest review."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a rather impressive sound for the cost. I find them to have met my expectation in terms of sound quality. I love the cloth covered cord as it prevents tangles, not to mention it is incredibly long in comparison to most. The only complaint I have is when I wear my glasses, the pressure from the headphones on my ears can cause some discomfort.....but I suspect that is normal for anyone who wears glasses with headphones."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds fine but there is a plastic that is placed like a volume control but isn't (just there for show) that broke during arrival and is now just hanging wire. Disappointed since the reviews were so positive and am shock that it broke so easily.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We had to get headphones as part of our school supply list this year. These were perfect. My kids loved the colors without being ""cute"" and distracting at school. They fit my 7 and 8 year old very well and appear to be durable so they should withstand a year of school."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones for my daughter who loves listening to music on her iPod and playing educational games on the computer. We have purchased less durable, cheaper quality headphones in the past but they certainly didn't last. When I had the opportunity to purchase these lightweight, compact headphones, I decided to give them a try. They arrived promptly and I must say, the color is beautiful and certainly makes them appealing to younger children and teens. I love how they fold up compactly, making them convenient for travel. They work great so far and we have no complaints. My daughter is happy with them!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars," Let me start off by saying these are probably the cutest pair of headphones I have ever owned. The color is lovely and vibrant! I went with the light blue and I'm sure glad I did. I can assure you you'll definitely get loads of compliments if you're out wearing them.

Not only are they really cute but the sounds quality, at least from my experience, is great! They sound clear and there's no muddy sound and I'm very happy that the bass doesn't eat up the mids and trebles as a lot of the time that's even an issue with pricey headphones.

They are definitely of good quality and fit quite comfortably (on me, they run a bit small on my husband - so fit /will/ depend on person wearing). And you can pretty much carry these anywhere as they are quite compact. Definitely a great pair of headphones that are worth your buck.

DISCLAIMER: I received this product for free/discounted in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought two of these for our kids to listen to their Leap Reader pens in the car without driving each other or us crazy. They are perfect! I love that they can fold up to be stored somewhere smaller, and the cord is very long, and covered with paracord – type material so they can't chew through the plastic like they did their old ones. They seem like they will be able to hold up to kid – use. We will likely be buying more for their little brother and possibly even for us!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a VERY destructive toddler but these headphones have withstood the test of time! They are padded and so bendable that it makes them very difficult to break, The cord also has a rope material that would make it hard to split, tear, or break. The volume is limited, which is great for small children, but not so much so that they would have difficulty hearing (I've had that problem with other children's headphones). They also adjust to fit an older child or adult head comfortably.

The only complaint I have is that the foam padding on the ear piece does come off when pulled on, which is probably expected. It took me a few tries to get it back on properly but I have no issues with it now."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these headphones because they appeared to be geared towards the sizing of women. They fit right and the sound is fine. But the black plastic housing for the microphone just unsnapped. I wasn't even using it. Now I'll have to superglue it so the inner electronics don't come undone.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for the plane ride and quiet traveling!
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"WARNING!! DONT BUY

The jack cap came off after i was trying to take the headphones out of my phone. the sound was permanently broken (because my phone still thought headphones were in) there was no way to fix it. i ended up having to buy a new iphone. the same thing also happened to my brother, who had to replace his ipad. unless you have warranty on your products, they refuse to replace the device, because the headphones aren't apple products, so we both had to pay full price."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"why it is made in china,why not US or other countries."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it! You can hear the music/audio clearly and someone else can't really hear the audio you are listening to when you are using the headphones. She actually has a pretty big head and it fits her perfectly. It also fits her mother and sister very well too.
Although, one bad thing, is that when you are in a call with someone, they can't hear you when you are speaking into the mic (of the headphones).
There is also a button on the mic, which I don't know what it is for, and it seems that it's only use is to end the call.
But overall, it is pretty good for an item that is less than $20.
(By the way, the product says it is Light Blue, but it is actually like an aqua green with a hint of light blue.)"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can only listen to so much Dan TDM on youtube before I want to gouge my ears out, so I've been looking for an iPad compatible headset for my son. He's five, and these fit perfectly. They didn't slip off, even when he took a short youtube break to headbutt our cat. They fold up to a really compact size, so they can fit in my purse to carry around when we go places. And they look pretty cute on him. The pastel colors are a lot less jarring next to his tiny features than the black headphones you normally see. He said the sound was great. Two thumbs up."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This lightweight and foldable head phone has stylish design and reflect-able pain/color in it which is great for walking at night. The headphones is very well made, the band can be adjust according to your head size and it fits nicely and comfortably on my head. The earpieces are super cushioning, which help eliminate noises and also bring great quality sound. The cord is cover by canvas fabric, which increase the flexibility, and durability. The sound quality is great, both bass and treble blend nicely together which bring great depth to the sound.
I am really like it and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
I got this Lightweight foldable headphones at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones are really appealing to the eye and very comfortable. The unique colors and the style is what caught my eye, not to mention that it's foldable, so it is easy to carry anywhere. The sound system is pretty descent, I can hear my videos clearly and vivid, something that some headphones lack... I would definetely recommend this headphones to anyone, at the current moment my son uses it for his youtube viewing and he has not given me any negative feedback."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are pretty cool. I just got them and pulled them out of the box and could not wait to review these. So they are a pretty light blue color which my daughter loves. And they fit her really well. I like that the cord is long. And the cord is fabric on the outside. Which is nice. It is not plastic. The sound is really good. And she uses it with her Kindle fire. She watches movies and plays games. So I like it for the fact that now I don't have to listen to her playing on it at all now. I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion and review.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! I included a pic of my 2.5 yr old wearing them as well as an adult wearing them. They were slightly loose on my daughter, however they still stayed up well...pretty good considering she's a toddler. I'm hoping they'll last her a couple of yrs. They feel great and secure when I wear them. We haven't used them while with a cell phone but the sound for videos and music is great."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones and love that fact that it has a microphone so you can use it to talk on the phone as well! I got this for my daughter, she just got a cell phone for her birthday & as much as earbuds are small and convenient, it's to uncomfortable for her little ears - so I got her these instead for when she's listening to music or just talking for hours on the phone. Sound quality is good - both listening to music and using it to talk on the phone."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used it once and went to use it a second time and one side did not work
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the headphones look stylish, they aren't as comfortable as I thought they would be. I'm a teenager with a relatively small head but no matter now much I adjusted the headphones, they were too tight. The cushions on the headband and over the ear parts help, but they still pushed painfully on my ears and temples. I thought that this may have been caused by my glasses, but after testing this, I found this was not the case. Additionally, their folding ability was a bit underwhelming since the part that covers your ears was the only piece that folded, so the size wasn't really changed when doing this.

On the other hand, the sound quality is very clear and the volume is perfect. However, the remote on the cord caused the audio to pause and play at random times; this is very annoying and difficult to fix. Even with the remote, the cord was impressive due to its thick, braided exterior and I'd be surprised if it broke anytime soon. The headphones were very durable with bright and attractive colors. I would recommend getting these headphones for a child rather than a teen or adult."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, they still work or i would give them one star. Very cute, comfortable, great sound... but who ever designed these didn't think through long term wear... the pads eventually come off! And they are VERY difficult to put back on, and stay on ONLY if they are treated like a baby bird. The second they get bumped they fall off again! I'm going to try gluing them tomorrow... we'll see how it goes.
Boo."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I let a fairly responsible 9 year old straight a student use this for around 2 weeks and it came back to me with the ear thing unglued and no sound on one ear. so maybe not for child use?

The mic's a standard headphone mic and the buttons on the cord only control pause and play without the colume buttons. Not a huge draw back but there's room for improvement. Chord seems pretty sturdy and durable. The headphone jack is made so that the ends of the chord dont snap eventually as a lot of headphones do. Overall an excellent buy"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphones come well packed and they are light weight and Comfy my Girl use to watch movies and listen to music she saids that the sound is so good and she loves the color and has a good price they are Great. I would Recommend this product.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great for what I needed... As an adult they fit fine for about an hour or so but if you wear glasses they might get uncomfortable after that point. The sound is clear and the microphone works great for calls and meetings. Definitely not for people with bigger noggins. As a side note, regular gaming headsets are borderline too big on me, I always have to set them to the tightest fit."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this for our kids to use with their iPads on long trips. The ear covers are a soft plastic material, which makes it easy to wipe with sanitizer. The jack fits both an iPad mini and a regular iPad. It folds and is adjustable, which is very cool, especially for storing in a desk or schoolbag. What surprised us was the sound quality, though--as good as the brand names we all know and love, but for way less cost. The cord is covered with a braided cloth, which is nice for kids--less chance of nicks. A very light headset, which is good for kids also. We found that heavier earphones make his neck hurt after a while. But with this sound quality, adjustable sizing, and long cord, we've been using it too. Another nice feature is that the plastic/rubber is thick, with quality hinges that allow them to collapse down easily. We Will probably pick up a few more in the future."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones a lot, mostly I like that they are able to be folded up so you can store them easily in your bag. The ear covers are very soft and mold great to my ears. They are very comfortable to wear. The sound is great and it is very easy to use the microphone. All you have to do is press the button and there you go! They are adjustable on each side too so you can get the right fit for your Skull!!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic, bought for my 5 year old. Great quality and vibrant color. I am going to buy a pair for myself!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've fallen in love with these headphones. They do substantially block out noise and are very comfortable to wear. They also come with a six month warranty which is great. When a problem developed, I communicated with customer service, they were prompt and are sending a new pair. I recommend both the company and the product highly"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work really well and I like that they are also comfortable. They also seem durable and I think that they won't break easily. I like the colors but so did my niece. She liked them so much that I gave them to her and may just have to buy my own.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my 8 year old son. Good enough for him, sound quality was ok, but didn't do much to cancel out outside noise. Got them for a trip that we took and he was able to use them on the airplane and the fit was good. I also used them, and they fit my adult head as well."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because they were on sale during a lightning deal, and because they matched my computer. For 13 bucks, I didn't expect them to be anything special. After opening them and using them a little, they are about as underwhelming as I expected. They are an on-ear style, fairly light weight, and fairly comfortable for on-ear headphones. The cups are very stiff however, and do not bend or adjust easily. The cord is a nice braided fabric and is actually quite long, longer than I expected which is a plus for me. The sound quality these put out is fairly average. Highs are quite good but mids are very muddy. Bass is average, and anyone who loves low bassy cans will be disappointed with these. Overall, with these headphones, you get your money's worth, but there are better headphones out there for around the same price."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks good. This one replaces another similar model head phone from the same company. I am hoping that this will last longer than the other AILIHEN headset that I got for my son. On the old one, one side when bad without any noticeable damage to it."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my ten year old daughter. So far she has loved them, just the right color, and the cord doesn't seem to tangle like others do. She has mentioned her ears get sore after a while since these are not completely over ear. But she also didn't want something that was too large to carry in her little bag.

I've read the reviews about poor quality so will amend this if they fall apart."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Build quality: cushioning is pretty plush you’ll eventually tire out after prolonged use but really good for the price. The cord which seems like it won’t give out any time soon. They are foldable so very travel friendly. And the orange color scheme the one I ordered was just like the picture.

Sound: pretty clear sound the bass is a little muddled and it won’t reach a very high volume but pretty good sound quality overall for the price."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love the colors of these headphones so when I was offered them for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered them. They are definitely lightweight and super comfy. I gave them to my niece at Christmas but tried them on before and I can't believe they almost feel like they aren't on my head. She loves them and won't take them off. I definitely recommend these cute purple and green headphones."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed. Thought I was getting a good set but it stopped working after a month and a half. Suppose to have a 3 month warranty. When I hit replace or return, it says it can't be replaced or returned after one month."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones. The foam is very comfortable around the ears. The cord has a ""shoelace"" feel so it's so much sturdier than the plastic covered wired ones my family and I are use too.
The color is vibrant! It's a beautiful color to see when the normal black can be tiresome.
The sound is amazing! This is our new favorite pair!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of headphones which I have ordered from this company, and once again, I am not let down! Although this is not a brand that I recognize from the USA, judging by the quality and craftsmanship of the headphones themselves as well as how nicely it is packaged, I am willing to bet that this is a premium brand elsewhere. Just very very nice!
One of my favorite features of these headphones is the wiring. It almost looks like a nylon shoelace, very different from the typical rubber covered wiring on many other brands. This is a major plus to me because my terror of a cat is not remotely interested in chewing this wire up like he is the rubber type. This is also beneficial to the longevity of the cord as fraying and tearing have yet to be an issue that I've encountered.

This unit is heavily padded on both the ear muffs as well as the headband. This allows for ample comfortable listening time for Peppa Pig movies and Bubble Guppies as well, as the songs on there drive me mad and I'd rather not hear them. My daughter however absolutely LOVES them. Okay, I'm swaying from course, but you get the point, these are COMFORTABLE! And although I purchased them for my preschool aged daughter, I too have used them and can vouch for their comfort and performance.

I ordered the light blue and purple color variety, and it was very true to the color that you see on screen. The colors are extremely vibrant and make this a super stylish headset!

This unit folds in at the ears. This makes them instantly portable and compact! It also makes it easier to preserve the life of these headphones as when they are folded inwards, the earmuffs are protected and there is less of a chance of them getting snapped in half. (This has actually happened with a previous brand that I purchased). The hinges are thick and well made and I do not see them breaking anytime soon.

All of that is almost enough to make me purchase these, but the real test comes when you give them a listen. How do they sound you ask? I can honestly say that these sound excellent!! I compared them to my husbands high dollar headphone set and the sound quality of these was right up there with his! I was very impressed with the stereo surround sound quality. I was able to hear things that were going on from all different points in the show that I was watching. It really brought the show to life for me! And music...oh music!! I am able to hear every instrument clearly and distinctively. I truly am impressed as the price of these is phenomenal and was not expecting them to be THIS great!! I love them, my daughter loves them and my bank account didn't suffer.

I honestly can not think of a single complaint at this time for these headphones, but should any issues ever arise, I will update my review to reflect that. I would recommend this product. Five Stars from me!

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The I35 headphones sound great. I have small ears so after wearing earbuds for a while my ears tend to get a little sore-so I thought I would give these a try! They sound awesome with nice, solid base (just enough). I'm happy with them!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter really likes the color of this headphone. The light teal and purple colors do make this headphone stand out. My daughter has had no problems with it. She uses it with her iPad. It works well. Material appears to be sturdy. It's very soft for the ears too.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my 8.5 year old son to use with his hand me down iPod. They really cover his ears and he has not complained they are uncomfortable (he has complained about other sets). We hardly have to hear his music even when its turned up loud. When he wants to listen to music he searches these out specifically.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT IS TRUE! Poorly made. Made of cheap plastic left cuff came off in my hand today, one day after 30 days. No controls, only on and off."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are definitely not an expensive purchase, but they are very cute work just fine. I love the color combination and am pleased with them as a nice pair of cold weather headphones that keep my ears warm."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are super lightweight, but durable and well made. They fit my 5 year old perfectly! They are sound reducing, which is nice. I got these on a lightening deal and I'm so happy with this product so far."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously awesome! I wanted to get SkullCandy headphones but then I saw these, super happy! These headphones are very comfortable. The sound quality is awesome and the microphone works awesome. Definitely would buy again!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"bought these for my wife to replace another pair of headphones she had which broke. She loves the ""over"" ear headphones and we were surprised it actually has a volume control. the color is striking as well. as for the important stuff - the sound is excellent, even for our middle aged ears."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These work as expected but the ear piece easily comes loose. I got these for my seven yr daughter and I'm constantly having to fix the ear piece due to it coming off.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones lasted all of 6 weeks before one side of them broke off unprovoked. I would not recommend.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These head phone was given to my daughter. She love the sound, style and color. Every chance she get they are on her head, boy does she enjoy them. Thanks for pleasing my daughter. She love them"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't spend too much time with this device on my ears. It becomes like oppressing my ears after few minutes, and I have to remove it or re-adjust it frequently."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to be a good quality. I like the cord and jack. The microphone is in a much better place than my in-ear headphones. I like the responsiveness of the button on the cord.
I do think the headphones could be louder and the bass could be fuller."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,If I could give these negative stars I would!!! Warning - if you want disposable one time use then go for it. Fell apart immediately- the foam ring separates from plastic head piece. Cheapest / junkiest thing ever!!!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son purchased these headphones for himself and he is really enjoying them. He loves unique colors and likes to stand out and these headphones were perfect for him. He wears them 24/7!
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headphoene, the price is reasonable and the color is as descripted. I got it 2 days after I order it. I like that the end is protected with plastic that you can reused when you travel. the volumen is pretty good. my laptop doesnt have a good audio, but when I used this headphones I can listen everything very clear. its a good headphone to a good price. I totally recommeded it."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these, but today she told me they no longer work right. I was a bit taken since they are not even a month old. She showed me the cord where it has a very strong unbendable kink. I also noticed the insertion point at which the cord goes into the head unit is very loose, you can move it 1/8 of an inch forward and back. When you move it it distorts the music. Not good."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it when they were offering a discount and thought I had a good deal but was wrong. After using for some time one of the ear sets started to fall apart, although it did not damage the quality of the sound coming from the ear set. Quality of the sound is overall nice. Although, if I purchase next time, I will look for better options even if expensive."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are fantastic for the price. They fit well and have great sound. They also islotate noise fairly well which helps listen to music. Easy to fit to a variety of head sizes from small kids heads to adults. They also fold up nice and small. The only thing that is missing is a bag or case to keep them protected.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 6 yr. old and he loves them. They are adjustable and fit really well. Build and sound quality seem to be good, especially for the price. We haven't noticed any sound leakage from them and they seem to be good at passive noise cancelling."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I like the fact that these are noise canceling and that they fold up which makes them easy to carry with me when traveling. But they are extremely uncomfortable on your ears after wearing them for half an hour. I was really hoping I could use these until I could afford a better pair.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Christmas stocking stuffer to replace broken set granddaughter had, she loves them, we did a sound comparison to some expensive headphones and the quality was very, very good, we like that they fold to a small size to tuck away when traveling. A good item for the price. Highly recommend."

THESE ARE A...GEM! 🤗"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Corded headphones are still needed! I needed a set of headphones that my youngest child could use. He can not wear earbuds. These headphones have been wonderful. He can listen to the abc song over and over and I don’t have to. OH MY GOSH thank you for my sanity. These are pretty cool. They fold up. My youngest can fold them and wrap the cord. The sound is pretty good as well. I have used them when I am watching something late at night and I do not want to disturb my husband. The covering is very soft and has nice padding on the ear covers. They are up to the wear and tear that my children put on things. (albeit, I do not let them have free reign with them) I would buy these again!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Adorable and very soft on ears! Our 2.5 year old uses these. I took them on a flight for myself once and they worked but were slightly too snug. Made for kids or adults with small-ish heads
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My children love these! Helps during homework time to keep the other occupied. Quality sound and durable and the colors are great :) small and compact to carry in my purse.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so cute and comfy. I like the look of this with the leather look and feel ear pieces. The bright cheery color. The sound is really nice in both ears. The weight is good, I can wear these for hours without strain. They fit over my ears so nothing itching my ear canal like ear plugs do. Easy to adjust."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headphones!!!! I normally do not (ever) wear headphones. I find headphones bulky, heavy and not comfortable at all. These have completely changed my mind! First, I fell MADLY IN LOVE with the colors!!! I love having options and not just ""having options"" - having REALLY GREAT options! Then, fell in love with the teal/purple ones and ""had to have them""! These have got to be THE MOST comfortable headphones I have ever worn. These can be used on your phone too and they are very clear. For the price, these headphones are excellent!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were purchased for my 8 year old daughter. They fit her perfectly and the sound quality is amazing for a $12 pair of headphones. I might even get a pair for myself! These headphones are mostly used while playing Roblox (as of right now), because if I have to listen to Despacito one more time, I'm going to lose it. I'm hoping these hold up fine throughout the school year too."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were great for about 6 months and then they stopped working.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife just wanted something more comfortable to listen to music or podcasts in bed and not wake me. Nothing expensive, just a little more comfortable. She loves them and the price was right. Certainly not for a sound aficionado, but works great for its intended purpose."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great and far sturdier than most kids ones. They are very comfortable even for little kids. The only minus I see is that they do not have a limit to the volume like some others I have seen.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these when travelling. They aren't 100% noise blocking, but they block enough that I can enjoy podcasts, even in the back row of a plane. They fold nicely and are lightweight, too."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, but these headphones are so blasted tight that my ears hurt after using them. I wouldn't buy these again for that one reason."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money or time wasted ordering them. Very unhappy
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my child and was glad I opened and inspected prior to providing them to my child.

They were not sealed. They were also covered in a flaky substance. Not a few here or there, but all over, especially the underside which touched the head."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received these as a replacement for the C8 Ailihen headset. I must say that they stand behind their products and are very proactive if you have any problems whatsoever they will solve it for you. This heads looks great and I'm so excited for my son to enjoy it with his PlayStation 4!! Thanks so much to Ailihen for providing these headphones
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones soft light weight great bass and loud quality with extra soft ear pads for sound cancelling. I could wear these all day. Easy adjust and ear pieces folds inside. I love the braded cord proof they were built to last. Vibrant color and style. I received this at a distance for review of a promotion
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my daughter and as she said 'Cute""....works great so far.....bright and colorful,wished it had a carry case for it."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They had great sound but the band broke within the first two weeks. Totally bummed. I accidentally stepped on them (not full weight) in the dark and when I picked it up one earpiece was hanging. My fault, just bummed."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They arrived promptly. The mic does disconnect if it is even gently touched. It was not what we were expecting at all. The mic also looked like it was hard, but it is just a small piece on the floppy cord and is it able to be adjusted. They are fine for a headset, but not useful as a mic at all."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you contact me after FAther's Day I will give you a better review.
It's a gift for Father's Day for my husband because I'M tired of

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves them. They are very soft and comfortable and the color is beautiful. Her other headphones were too big for her and she could never get them to stay on her ears but these are perfect. I tried them on also and they fit me so they would be a good fit for kids and adults.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for price, sound quality was better than expected. Only thing is they start to hurt my ears after a while, they are ON EAR headphones, not OVER EAR headphones"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered 4 pairs for a road trip with our kids (ages 2, 4, 6 & 8). After more than 30 hours of use in the car, all have held up well except for the 2 Y.O.. Somehow, the volume control piece fell off/was ripped off of hers. The headphones still work, but the wires are exposed at that one spot. The other three pairs held up fine. My kids love the bright colors and size adjustability, and they said that they are comfortable."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,What can i say! Another awesome headphone from a great seller! Item is definitely what i expected! It is exactly as depicted or even better in hand! The sound is smooth and the base is great! The item is worth every penny spent! I got a discount but this is my honest opinion! Am actually listening to music from my phone as I write this review! Am a happy customer!
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,they didn't last very long. Sound was great while they lasted! 5 months of use and they broke. Used by adults only so they weren't mis-handled.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK headphones. The quality is what you would expect. My daughter keeps them in her backpack, so they take a beating. Seem to be holding up OK."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My niece really liked these when I gave them to her. It's nice to know I no longer have to listen to Peppa Pig when she wants to watch it on her tablet.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves these! They work perfect in her kindle and I love them because then I can't hear what she is listening to all the time. They fold up really nicely and are perfect for car trips and even at home. The colors are great and they fit perfect. The sound is excellent which is great for movies and music.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great!

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great for my 11-year-old when I first purchased them, he loved the sound quality and feel. Seven months later, they are completely broken. They are not built to last."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for Christmas last year. They worked well for the first 2 weeks. Then there was no sound out of one ear. I will not purchase again.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price point, these headphones are great. No complaints great for office as they are noise canceling but not so much so that you can't hear people coming.

Packaging is great as well."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice set of headphones for my grandson, he is very hard on headphones and this is a very good buy.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, love it!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones were nice. Bought these as a lightening deal. The left ear padding came off and the sound stopped shortly thereafter. Wish these would have lasted longer but you get what you pay for I guess.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for one of my daughters. She says they are comfortable and work really well. Couldn't beat the price; I had a coupon code that allowed me to get them for $11.99 each. I bought 2. Thanks, Ailihen!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very cute and reasonably comfy - the padded ear covers rest ON the ear instead of around, so there is a mildly annoying pressure (especially as an eyeglasses wearer).

Mostly not a fan of the audio quality. Felt very tinny and low quality - I have $20 earbuds that have a much more robust sound."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,got this for my grandchild. he likes to watch youtube videos and now will not disturb the rest of family.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these through Donors Choose for my first grade students to use with their Chrome Books. The headphones are very comfortable, and they do a good job muffling outside sound. I especially like that the cord is not plastic covered wires - it's cloth covered kind of like the material used to make lanyards or eyeglass holders. I think they will hold up well with lots of use...time will tell!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones! They are so soft and comfortable and don't irritate my ears with my glasses arms. Sound quality is nice and they are fairly good at noise cancelling.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love these headphones! Not only are the colors beautiful and vibrant but the sound quality is awesome. The bass is great. In some of the lower quality headphones the bass is very low or non existent. That's not the case with these. These are an all around great set of headphones. Even my two year old likes them and she hates anything on her head. Which means they are extra comfy.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are good solid headphones. For small ears.

They haven't broken yet and we've had many not even lasting a week.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"From wearing these more then when i wrote my first review, I am so disappointed. I cant wear them for that long or they really start to get uncomfortable. My ears start to hurt. Maybe better for kids."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I work at a school and we were looking for good headphones to use with iPads and Chromebooks alike.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound like expensive headphones...bass is rich!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were good headphones - for only 4 months of light use. The cord has a short in the middle of it and it cuts off the sound completely to one side. Such a bummer.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not noise canceling ! But thy work for regular headphones, comfy and have a compact fold. However I needed noise canceling, more ear protection and this was not it."

They play, pause, ect. button doesn't work on my computer, but works fine on my phone. Overall I thoroughly enjoy these headphones.

Update: After not even a year these headphones broke. The right earpiece broke off from the headphones. I was actually happy though because these were the most uncomfortable headphones I ever had the displeasure of owning. Even after constant use for months they stayed very tight on my head. I have a rather small head as well. I couldn't wear my glasses and headphones at the same time because the headphones just caused my glasses to dig into my head. They were awful. Definitely don't recommend for any adult, but might be good pair for a kid."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The moment I saw these headphones, i was amazed. Great quality headphones for a very good price! I love the braided nylon cord and how comfy they were. The way they fold up makes it easy to take along with you. I also love how there is only one cord on one side because a lot of the headphones have the cord on both sides and they can get in the way. The sound coming through is very clear to. I would definitely recommend these headphones to a friend!"

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter who has been begging for a set of headphones to listen to music/videos on her tablet. A huge bonus for us as we do not have to listen to those videos either. I ordered the light blue which is closer to a mint color to me, which is perfect as we love this color. They arrived in great condition. They are comfortable (soft padding), sound works good, and they fit her perfectly. They have been used almost daily, and she has not had any problems with them. I did receive a discount for this item, but we are all loving this one."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surpriingly good kid headphones!

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,grand daughter loves them
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality headphones with great stereo sound. It was a good buy for me
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good so far, great price, wonderful clear sound & comfortable."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 12-year-old daughter and she loves them. She uses them on her Samsung tablet and smartphone.They are good quality and the color is great for her. They fold easy and we bought a universal case to put them in while traveling. They do not hurt her ears and the cushion is not overpowering.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These suckers really keep the noise out. I use these at the office, especially when all the folks on my floor seem to be on their phones. I like the green and gray color combo too. The cord is super long and convenient for putting my phone in one spot in my cube and getting to work."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was really great. The sound is very clear and I like how the cord is thicker and not thin like most. The only problem I have is when I first used it, the earphones made a static noise and the sound sound went in and out if you touched around the earphone jack but other than that it was a good purchase and I would buy from them again."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have gotten a lot of use in my house. I use them, and my 4 year old son uses them. Despite the difference in size (and I have a big head!), we both use them easily. The sound is good (no, it's not top of the line good, if you want that you're going to be paying a lot more) but I have had no complaints about the quality. The materials are soft and well put together. I love the colour choices. I was concerned that they would bug me - I can be sensitive to textures, as is my son - but both of us can use them for long periods. We've had these for months and they still work and look just like the day they got here. I've used them with my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge), a Samsung Tab A tablet, a Fire HD 8 tablet, my laptop, and it's been compatible with all."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i just picked it up and surprisingly one ear piece aint working,i hope this will be sorted out ASAP"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these so my 5 year old could listen to her tablet without it being loud. They work, they’re comfortable, and she loves them."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"bought 6 months ago, worked great for the first 3-4 months, then the sound went bad. They fit my 11 year old daughter, great sound quality, until one day the sound got warped. Did not get wet, did not break, no visible damage, just degraded quality. My other daughter has a pair for 9 months and they still work great. Mixed bag, you gamble with these, either they are great or stop working after a few months."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are crap. Gave a pair to each of my two kids for Christmas and both are already shorting out and not working. If I could give a one half start rating I would.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these on the 24th on June and they were delivered on the 30th of June. They seemed like a decent pair of headphones, because they are not used for anything but for the gym and for audio on the computer. So, I bought another pair on the July the 4th for myself; the first pair were for my child. Mine broke like a week ago, and hers just broke today, August 28th. They broke where the earpiece folds and bends; maybe due to the fact it is made out of plastic."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am happy with this purchase after using it for a few months every night when I go to sleep and very often in the afternoon to just relax and listen.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very cute! If there is anything stopping me from giving it a 5 star, it's that the ear pieces are a tad small/after long usage they put some pressure on the ears.

Mic & Button for switching between tracks and whatnot do not work on desktops, which is fine for me but that is a heads up to anyone else!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for 2 years and they are still rocking. They did however break where they connect, I super glued them back together and that worked perfect, just cant bend them now. For the price, you cant beat them. When my current ones break, i will be buying another pair."

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is actually a Christmas gift so have not used it yet. I did take them out and look at them. They look nicer than the picture. Packaged good and arrived as expected.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for 1 week then the sound only came out of one side.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Fits my head great
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought six sets of headphones from this company, five were wonderful and perfect, one was clearly used. I don't appreciate being sold a used item."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem to be built well, sound fantastic. Great value."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product was horrible. I got them for my daughter since she needs headphones for school. They were in her desk and only came out when she needed it. A couple of months into the use they fell apart and she had to tape them just to make it through to the end of the year. Not happy at all
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not really a secret that I'm not a fan of going to sleep. I LOVE to sleep, but I alway hate actually going to sleep. I do enjoy laying in bed, though. I'm a night owl, sadly my MR is not, so I watch movies at night with my iPhone ear buds while he snores away next to me. We don't get along though, those earbuds and I. They tend to hurt my ears after a movie, but I thought I had no better options. My earlobes are gauged to a 1/2 inch, and I wear double flared tunnels most of the time. When I wear over the ear headphones, they tend to push my tunnels into my head, and it hurts. I was given the Ailihen I35* headphones free to review, and I was excited but also wary. I was worried they were going to push my ears like everything else I have tried. Still, I was willing to give them a shot. If they sucked less than the earbuds, it'd be a step up.

They were delivered rather quickly, and the first thing I noticed about them was the color. Now, I know what color I was getting, but I wasn't expecting just how pretty it was in person. It's a poppy aqua blue with a light purple on the underside and covering the speakers. There is a light purple line around the headphones as well. (Bonus, the blue matches my favorite pair of Converse!) It's wrapped in soft leather, giving it a very comfortable cushy feeling on your head. They're not too tight so no head squeezing is going on. even with my mass of hair. The ear pieces are extendable by a little to fit all sizes of heads. They fit my tiny head as well as MR's large noggin.The sound is crystal clear, but can't be heard outside the headphones, so I didn't have to worry about disturbing the MR while he was sleeping and I was up all night watching horror movies cursing my insomnia. He couldn't hear any screaming or chainsaws or people being sucked into hell, and I had all that stuff pretty loud. I could barely hear his {VERY LOUD} snoring over even the lowest parts, so it drowns out sound just as well as it keeps sounds in. I love how they fold up, so it will be easy to throw them in my purse and take them with me on long road trips. There's a little plastic piece on the cord that houses a mic and a PLAY/PAUSE /END CALL button. The mic picks up sound clearly and the button is very useful when I don't want to take my phone out of my pocket to stop a song on pandora. Overall, I'm incredibly impressed and happy with these. If you're looking for good headphones at a great price, you should check out the Ailihen I35. They come in 5 great colors so there's options for everyone."

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 year old can use and it didn't have to listen to the same songs over and over
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,They feel/look/sound good- but sadly I don't find them very comfortable to wear especially after 2 hours- perhaps the muffs are too small or the headband is just a bit too tight but it really starts to feel sore.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Appears ok. No problems. (Bought for my son)

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids ages 6-9 find them comfortable and they seem to work well so far. The headphone doesn't feel heavy, and the adjustment is easy and secure- it almost gets big enough for my head, but the earphones are sized for kids' ears."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are perfect for me. The kids needed headphones for school that went over the ear. I really liked that they are foldable and don't get tangled in their backpack
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of these because I was impressed with the reviews. I just don't get them now. These. Are. Cheap. The earpiece became disconnected from the headband within two or three uses. Also, the cushion came off almost immediately and you cannot put it back on! Once again, I took a chance and ordered from a different seller (other than Amazon), and, once again, I got screwed."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these!! They're comfortable, they're adorable, and the sound quality is great!! Plus the price I got them for was incredible!! I love the color, I'm a sucker for mint and pastel purple."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones! They adjust easily but don't slide down while wearing. The cushioned earpieces are not too tight but do a nice job of blocking out noise and deliver quality sound.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome quality. Sound is great, the colors are vibrant and I love how the cord is a nylon material. The head phones feel very durable. That's what I was looking for."

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, added bonus the cord is not plastic covered like most but nylon. Bought these for my kids, and the last pair the cord had been chewed through (kid or cat not sure which) That problem seems far less likely with these. The fact that they fold make packing ad storing them easier as well. So far very satisfied!"

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound a comfort are good but not amazing. The two real benefits are fashion and phone calls.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best headphones I've ever tried! They have great audio and feel great on me, but do hurt after a while. I love how they fold up so I can take them anywhere and everywhere!

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These lasted 3 days before the cushion separated from the ear piece. We had to tape the cushion back on to the head set. I reached out to the seller and sent pictures.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These actually work with XBOX and PS4 chat as well. Everything about this headset is great - and the price was right. HOWEVER, the actual ear pieces are a little small and after about a half-hour of use they start to hurt my ears."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have been great to wear when I am working. My office can be noisy at times, and they block out sound very well. They are comfortable, and have held up nicely!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had them for a couple of weeks now. It has gotten to the point where the angle of the cord controls whether both ears work or not. This usually happens with earphones/headphones that aren't stored properly. This makes me sad though, because I really like the headphones. They're really cute and comfortable. I'm just hoping that the one ear doesn't go out completely."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Headphones were too small for my medium sized head. It hurts the ears. Even my kids did not like it much. The sound quality is good though. The 3 starts is only because the headphones was not very comfortable for me. The sound quality was acceptable
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The head phones came as expected. The build is average for the price point. They are a bit small, as stated in the reviews. This is probably because they are a Korean brand. Great for children."

* Bought separate Carry Case"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well made.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this for a year and used them for much less than that. Sound quality is great for the price. Cord is overly long and gets caught on things all the time making it inconvenient. Also, recently it has started skipping and stopping songs without me pressing the remote. Devices also have started thinking the headphones have been unplugged even though it is still in the jack. This has resulted in calls being dropped and a lot of notifications from my computer as it goes back and forth thinking the headphones are in or out. In general, the headphones are fairly comfortable. I wear glasses and often the headphones dig the arm of my glasses into the side of my head, but that's probably standard for over-ear headphones."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, easy to pack, lightweight, seems sturdy so far, just kinda tight on the ears....I have a big head
After using these on a trip to Europe, I love them! Best sound for the price!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, ear piece covers don't slip off as they do with my kids others. My 4 year and I can both comfortably wear them so they are obviously adjustable."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are wonderful!! My daughter is very happy with them! My kids are very rough on things and these have survived it all!! Great buy!!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my Granddaughter. She loves everything about them, starting with the bright color. The sound is great and she can use them on a variety of her electronics. She also likes the way they safely fold up for storage and carrying. One of her favorite features is the mute button on the cord."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are so cute and so comfortable and they work great. We bought them for our 4 year old on her birthday so she could use them in the car/airplane without disturbing her baby sister (and anyone else).

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. I raved about these headphones for about two weeks-until the sound blew out in the left ear. Very disappointed in this promising product.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: These headphones look great! For the price you pay no one would guess they were ""bargain"" headphones. The color is very vibrant and true to the photo on the website. The ear cushions are very soft and comfortable even after extended use. I especially like the cord of the headphones because they're more like a string material than your standard plastic cord; this makes for a much more durable cord.

Cons: Unfortunately, the sound quality is lacking. It's not bad sound,but it's not really good either. The bass is especially disappointing; it's more of a muddy sound than anything else."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for about a month now and they are pretty spectacular. I love the color so much. I got the minty purple one. The cord is so long too, much loner than a standard headphone cord. It also has a button I can use to change songs or pause and play songs, it does not adjust volume though. It also has a built in mic but I haven't used the mic yet so I don't know how well it works. It's very sturdy and comfy to wear. Oh and it's adjustable. It's a great purchase for good quality headphones at such a low price."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones we've bought for our kids. We actually bought two (one for each) and they work great. They cancel noise so the kids don't complain when we're talking or listening to the radio during car rides. They've even used them on planes. Durable and haven't had any issues
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 12 loves these! He's really picky when it comes to headphones and ear buds, but loves these.

Update: year later and they are still going strong with daily use. He hasn't picked up his other headphones or earbuds since he got these."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These fit loose on my six year old and big on my three year old but both are able to use them fine. With the microphone piece when my husband's Bluetooth wasn't working he was even able to use it with his phone.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,We had it for 3 months. The head phone looks brand new. The plug to connect iPad is off the wire already. You pay what you get!
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, this headset seems to be defective, only one side works. Please advise of what you can do"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have put down 4 stars because
A. They came in very well packaging
B. There actually good quality headphones for the price.
C. I love the colors, and the padding is pretty well comfortable.
The downfall to this product is that they are a bit on the heavy side when you put them on. Plus there are more fitted to what you would prefer. There a little to tight where they are up to your ears. After I wore them for like 15 to 30 min they were starting to hurt my ears already. In a way they were to snugged. Other then that there really not that bad."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,It seems like it has a short in it but all I do is move it and it is okay! I would buy again because they are so comfortable.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great and the collapsible feature is wonderful, but I wish the cord was retractable. Rating 5 stars still, because the headphones do exactly as they were promised. Wishful thinking on the retractable cord.
My 6 year old son uses them and he can still hear me when I need to tell him something, but it blocks enough of the background noise, radio, talking, etc for him to focus on his games or videos in the car."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear cover part comes off pretty easily and took me a while to figure out how to put it back. That was quite frustrating, but otherwise these work well and my daughter loves them. I ordered another for her cousin and another for her to use at school!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered three of these and they survived heavy and unpredictable use from three children and are now at school for classroom use.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the color of the headphones! The quality of sound is pretty decent for the price.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,they are gorgeous and it sounds really good the only thing is that the material it not that breathable and it can get kind of sticky

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,For the money....😩They broke on the head! Like the third time we wore them! It will not go back together.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones quit working sporadically on the right side within a couple months. I wish I would have known about the ""free/cheap product in exchange for positive review"" phenomenon that is happening on Amazon before I purchased these. The sound is average, ""good-enough"" quality but the fact that sometimes I only get sound on one side makes them almost worthless to me now. I even used dollar-store earbuds instead of these until I got my Hesh 2 headphones, which are wonderful by the way.

*Note: If you see a product with great reviews and a lot of them, check to see if there are a lot of customer photos (it seems like this is something the review buyers either request or require of their reviewers when they give them free or reduced-cost products). If it's something you haven't heard of much or at all outside of Amazon, the good reviews are probably ""paid"" and I would recommend staying away. Sometimes the reviews will also say that the reviewer received the item in exchange for the review. Amazon used to be a place I trusted for consumer opinions; sadly, this is not the case anymore."

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good stereo at good price
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had a set of these sent to friends for their kids and both sets arrived broken. It was very embarrassing and now my friends have to return them to me so I can return them to the manufacturer.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars," I tried these on my sons NABI2 and in the Headphone Jack of my Tahoe. The sound quality is fresh and clear.

The cord is made of braided nylon. Similar to paracord material. They dont get tangled or knotted up. The cord is permanently attached to the ear piece. So with kids, it wont come out. Which can be a hassle if there is a really great Alivin and the Chipmunks tune blaring and the cord comes undone then so does your kid.... OMG! lol.

The ear pieces are adjustable by moving up and down to adjust for head height. So these fit my 3 year olds head and my adult head. Which is a nice attribute to have. You can see them adjust in the video as welll.

Hopefully the video helps your purchase decision. Because even tho I got a discount, this is a really nice set.
*received a discount for my review and experience with this product."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these when my old headphones failed on me. These are gorgeous, just as pictured, and really channel out sounds; I can usually hear others in the room talking even with my headphones but it totally blocked out those trying to get my attention and I don't blast my music to unreasonable levels! Had them for a week, mind, but so far so good.

UPDATE:
Despite their prettiness, these headphones broke on me within weeks. Twice! The seller was kind enough to replace the first one and quickly and I was even more gentle than I was before in case I was too rough. Didn't make a different because it broke again within the same time span."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We just took a long road trip from Kentucky to Florida and back. We had found some portable DVD players at a yard sale and we needed head phone for my daughter. These were perfect and very comfortable. It made our trip a lot better because she could watch movies without bothering her brother.

If you or your child needs nice set of head phone, make sure you check out the Ailihen I35 Stereo Lightweight Foldable Headphones. They are just what you need! They are available in several colors.

The only issue we had was that the ear pad came off but you can pop off the little piece and easily put it back on."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter was so happy to get these headphones at Christmas. But, before one month has passed of her using them almost daily, the tip of the plug has broken off in an iPad at school. My daughter is not the careless type. She is very good at taking care of her things and didn't yank it sideways. Sadly, I wouldn't buy these headphones again."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price ($20 when I bought it) I was just looking for some cheap, cute, comfortable over-ear headphones. I was sick of using my earbuds at home. I saw these and figured I'd trust the reviews. They are definitely not the highest end but the physical quality holds up. I've dropped them a few times and they work fine.
The size adjustment is great, the cushions on the ear cups are soft, and the fabric cord is a nice touch.
I do agree with some people that they do get a little uncomfortable after wearing for about 40 minutes or more. I usually have to take a minute break and remove them.
Also, I do a lot of listening with only one cup on my ear and there doesn't seem to be any bad stress on the headband itself from going behind one ear and staying on the other. And when that one ear gets uncomfortable, I switch ears.
The sound is decent, what you should expect with these priced phones. The bass isn't nearly as good as I wish they were, but the highs are pretty decent. Crisp quality for the most part, some static when I crank the volume and play songs with big highs/lows. Good for casual listening, not recommended for analyzing in any sort of professional manner.
There is a lot of sound leaking despite creating a tiny vacuum between your ears and the speakers. They are loud enough to hear from a while away, so keep that in mind when you consider what you will be listening to.
On the fabric/braided cord, it has a dongle to pause/change songs, and there is a mic which I've only been able to get working on my Ps4 (yes it can be used as a headset, which is great!). The cord itself, despite being braided, kind of tangles still so that's also a downside.

I've attached a few pics and a video of the sound leak.

Overall they are great for the price and do what they're meant to; Cheap and easy to use.
I'll post again if something happens.

EDIT 03: My second pair, and just like the first, one ear went blank. Still never even left my house with the headphones; they were always plugged into my computer, yet somehow one ear goes out AGAIN. Kinda frustrating, but they are lower priced and thus you get what you pay for. Good for a good time, but not a permanent staple in your audio arsenal. :("
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,used these on some travels. very comfortable super light weight. great quality on the sound and the cord was solid and long
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love these, the color is super cute and they sound AMAZING. The mic is very clear and I can be heard with no trouble. I use them for my kindle AND my phone. Thanks!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,They're so pretty. SO PRETTY. But they're made for tiny children ears. Hurts to wear them for more than an hour at a time
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these! I bought them mainly for the color, but they fit great (they are on the snug side but I prefer that) and have a built-in microphone in the cover. They had a very strong chemical smell when I took them out of the package, but I just let them sit out for a few days and the smell eventually dissipated. I love that they aren't overly large and bulky but still provide great sound quality and noise-cancellation."

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son received these headphones for Christmas. His older brother tried them and asked for a pair two weeks later. They are compact and the boys like the sound.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my 8 year old to use with her tablet. They work great and they are nice and loud. I love the on and off switch.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really nice headphones, the only drawback is how tight on the head they are. I have had to work on stretching them out so they are not painful."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m amazed at how comfortable and stylish this headphone is. I haven’t tested out the mic yet, but so far I’m loving this headphone."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are not only cute, but they fit my 5 year old girl perfectly. They are very cushioned, which make them comfortable for her to wear. The best part is that they stay on her head comfortably rather than sliding back or forward. I also love that the cord is covered in a soft material, almost like a shoe lace. It is also great that the cord is only on one side of the headphones, so I don't have to worry about her getting it caught around her neck. She loves them and so do we!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 2 sets of headphones for Christmas presents for my daughters. It's now June and neither pair works without holding the wire at a certain angle while listening.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These thing rock. Loud enough to where I can yell at my husband and he can't hear me lol. The cord is shoe lace material which I love. My husband says they are comfortable and stay on head nice am secure. Buy this item with confidence
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound quality and the color (I bought the mint one). Adjustable and foldable. I don't know if it's just me but it really hurts my ears after a while. Also if you're looking for noise blocker headphones, this one wouldn't be the correct choice.

Edit 10/30/2017: I can't use it more than 5 min cause it fits too firm and hurts my ears so badly. Adjustment doesn't help the pressure on ears. And no, I don't have a huge head or ears :/ I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my daughter and only after a couple of weeks the foam ear protector fell off. Tt's really difficult to put back on and then it just falls off again after a short time of use.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome headphones, perfect sound, beautiful color and easily foldable for my backpack, love the solid cord too. To top it off I'm able to transmit team gameplay games at home on the PS4 when I'm not out, with crisp sound and feedback. /someone who transits to work via foot on a daily basis and can be rough with my equipment"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to use at work. I do a lot of computer work and sit near our customer service staff. They have reduced the noise around me. They are very comfortable and lightweight.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"got these on Prime day for $15, i just wanted over ear headphones that would work with old tech. these work with a decade plus old Walkman so i assume they will work with literally anything you can think of that has a 3.5 MM headphone jack. haven't really tested the sound quality but they fit fine. will update if i have any issues."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these because my love of Slipknot was disturbing my coworkers. I can now enjoy my music without bothering a single soul around me! Awesome!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lasted all of 25 days. Something is now loose/worn around the volume control buttons. It sounds like the music is playing out of a tin can unless you wiggle the wires to a certain position and hold it there. I wasn't expecting awesome quality for this price, but I was expecting at least a year or so of use."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Im a teacher and bought a dozen in two different colors. One has stopped working and is making buzzing noises and another’s material didn’t stay. Disappointed because the price is expensive and thought I would have better quality
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones purchases for my 8 yo daughter. Seem to be good quality and love the foldable option for traveling. Only complaint is the ear cushions/openings are kind of small and put extra pressure on the top of her ears and she can't wear them for long periods of time. We both have small ears and even I noticed the tightness. Overall, for the price the headphones work well and she enjoys them, just has to take breaks."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a bit snug on ears but that's what you get when you have a round big head, lol. Anyways, these are great headphones."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, cord has a nylon cover that is better than the rubber or plastic ones, they feel cushion and produce a decent sound on a compact size."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I did not realize the newest iphone does not have the port for such device but I still love the device and use it with computer!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've given these headphones to all three of my brother's kids for birthday presents recently. They are 9 year old twins and a 6 year old boy. They all love them and enjoy them with their tablets and iPods. I am no sound expert so I can't speak to the quality of the sound but when I used them they sound great. No static or fuzz. They also come in a lot of great colors that allowed me to pick something I thought they would enjoy. Overall, a good value!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had bought these before. I needed another pair. I use these when I know my phone call will or could be long as I hate holding the cell phone to my ear. These ate really super and the price is perfect! Great sound. Enjoying them!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken right out the box
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for a plane ride and don't regret a thing! Very good sound quality and well put together for the price. It's adjustable so it can fit smaller of larger heads... to large for a child I believe but perfect for adults!
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the color combination - nice to use when my husband has the MSM news on or flipping channels. I can listen to my instrumental music and accept phone calls & the caller can hear me.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, my kids really like the fun colors and the soft and smooth materails. We bought 2 for our kids 5th and 3rd grader who are home schooled. The cord is wrapped in fabric so I think it will last them longer. These headphones are loud!! I will buy these again."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome head phones, I bought this for a nine year old , because he seem to destroy head phones on a whim but so far these held up. Well design!!!!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were bought for our 10 year old son, and he loves these! He doesn't mess with his tablet unless he is wearing them now, even in his room. First headphones he has likes!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed in these.. Lasted all of one day before one side stopped working. Typical Chinese junk. Don't waste your time on these. Amazon did take them back and issued a refund. Won't be buying another pair of these
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price of the headphones i was actually surprised by how good the sound quality is. The color I ordered (green and purple) also looks just like the picture.
I would recommend these for someone looking for good sound quality and comfort in inexpensive earphones."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 2 weeks.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a paid review. This was bought as a replacement for my daughter as her previous pair of headphones broke. She absolutely loves the headphones as she is on the tiny side and the adjustment allows the headphones to fit properly. The colour is also big selling point for her. The folding capabilities of the Ailihen headphones also makes it easy for her to put it safely in her backpack without worrying about it breaking like the last pair.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good looking headphones that work. My daughter needed them for her laptop at school and as long as they last a school year I will be happy. I brought a pair of white Sony for testing same price and they didn't hold up. Fingers crossed
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just be careful. I was getting up, but my arm was pressing on the cord since it's just on one side. SNAP! Still works."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones worked OK on my cellphone, but not my PC (I need two jacks and did not want an adapter). I read the description, but I may have misunderstood when it stated works on Laptop Computer.....I took that to mean laptop and computer. I don't like that there is only one little button for everything. The mic was not good. Everyone said I sounded like I was in a hole even when I had the volume up and put the mic closer to my mouth. The deal breakers: Mic not good on cellphone and when plugged into my PC I can either hear from the headset OR talk in MIC. I need both at the same time."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In our school, headphones are required for students to work on their Chromebooks including all tests and homework. I purchased this for one of my daughters and she loves them. So do I. Good quality, comfortable fit and most importantly, the speaker quality is on point. Some headphones are hard to hear through even when the volume is cranked and others blast the sound even when the volume is low. In the words of Goldilocks, these headphones are ""just right."""
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly good manufacturing and sound quality! Soft braided headphone cord should hold up a bit better than coated wire, too! Bought them for my 4yo who has never worn headphones or earphones...she instantly loved them. Down-side (or UP-side, if you will) is that they filter out sound so well that she (with the volume set to about 1/2 way on her Kindle) didn't hear my wife come home, slam the door 10ft away, and walk up to her asking her how her day was. This is a girl who will run from a whole different part of the house to greet her mama! Will probably buy a second pair for my 8yo. *Side note: Not comfortable for adult wear!*"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter and she loves them! The purple and pink is bright and fun, and the sound quality is good. I bought these for her kindy class, headphones were on the supply list, as much as she loves them we will probably need a pair for home too."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now bought two sets of these headphones and overall would buy a third.
Pros: The headphones are pretty cheap and super cute. The material is nice and soft and it doesn't hurt my ears to wear unless I've been wearing them all day long. The sound quality is good enough for me, though I'm no expert on these sorts of things. Better sound clarity and quality than $20 earbuds.

Cons: The first pair didn't last very long. About maybe 4 months in, the left ear's hinge (the one that allows it to fold off) snapped very suddenly and rendered my headphones unwearable. A quick, thrifty repair job later allowed them to be worn for another 5 months or so before the plastic holding my repair job became too stressed and gave way. I obviously liked them enough to buy a second pair, but I can't give the item 5 stars for this issue, which other reviewers have also reported on. Overall though, I can't complain too much for the price."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,So I was little skeptical ! but then wanted to try this one.The quality is really good for the price.The finishing is impressive because for the price I was expecting kind of uneven finish.It looks neat! The best part for me is the cord it looks like a thread which is cool! and has longer length.The button works fine ! fits in the audio jack of iphone/ipad perfectly! I will come back on the usage wearing.Update coming soon !
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We really liked these headphones for the handful of times my daughter used them. However, yesterday, after owning them for just a few months, and my daughter using them gently for no more than five times, the ear pad detached from the headphone itself. There doesn't appear to be a way to put the ear pad back in, or reattach it to the headphones itself."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this headphone for my cousin as a little gift for school because one of her classes required her to have one. Ordered this mostly because it looks pretty nice and she liked pink color. However, when I visited her last time and actually tried to see how's the sound quality and I was quite disappointed because the sound is too sharp especially considering this is for little kids. I don't expect very high quality for this price but definitely not something this sharp and loud. Do your kids a favor, get some higher quality ones."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones based on the reviews of good noise canceling - in fact there is zero noise canceling with these headphones, I could very clearly hear background noises, far too loud. The vendor did an easy return, about the only positive thing I can say about this purchase."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Admittedly, I beat the hell out of my headphones by listening to music that's not only loud, but also tends to feature a lot of distorted guitar, and heavy bass. My last set was an inexpensive Sony one that managed to last 3 years-a record for me. In fact, the only reason I retired them was because the faux leather on the earpieces was flaking off and going everywhere.
After reading the good reviews, I decided to give these a try. While the sound is not quite as crisp and clear, nor are they quite as loud as my Sony ones, they are quite good, and a great value for the price. I like the single cord, and the fold up design too. All in all, I'm quite happy with these...now it's just a matter of seeing how long they can keep up with me, lol!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones for my kids. I noticed that I had ordered a pair of these a while ago for my daughter. Definitely worth the purchase.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are wonderful, but I didn't realize that they are for kids! I wish they had a volume control as I have a hearing problem and there is no way I can raise the sound. But they are so soft and comfortable."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! These are super nice. The company accidentally send them to the wrong address but caught it and corrected the problem before I knew there even was one and it got here two weeks before I expected it to! Cord is strong and has a casing over it, and the headphones are great! Nicer than I expected"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were just what I was looking for. My grandson uses these often with his iPad and they are great. I would definitely buy these again
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones as replacements for other brands I purchased because the cords cracked and the connection was lost. They work great. Perfect for a little girl that loves the colors. They contain the sound and no noise escapes.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought another one of these in a different color for my boyfriend because he kept using mine to jog with! Now we both have our own and use them on the train when commuting and in the gym when working out. They have good sound quality (from what I can tell), are comfortable, durable, and they stay on while jogging. Best of all - they are affordable too! These headphones are great!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought 3 pairs of these headphones in different colors for all of my daughters. Ages 4, 6 and 9. They fit perfectly, lightweight and they love them! I will buy them again once they wear out. Highly recommend. Great product at a great price."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love these headphones! Very comfortable. I've been searching for a long time for headphones that I can wear while sleeping on my side. These are the most comfortable ones I've found. The side that is not lying down on the pillow doesn't come up off of my ear. It sits snugly in place. Great sound also.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these as a gift for my 11 year old daughter. She loves them and takes them every where with her.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my 11 years old daugther...she seems to enjoy them very much because it takes them everywhere. Now this seems to cancell noise pretty well because now i have the problem of my daughter not hearing me...hahaha. Thanks God the phone is set up with volume limit for the headphones. So far holding pretty good despite of the abuse. She loves how they fold so they fit nicely on her little purse. The color matches her phone case, my luck because i didn't realize that was the case."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy this if you wear glasses. The headphones are too tight and press uncomfortably. The leather bits are too hard.
Otherwise the build is solid and they look nice, the cord is great."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked them so much, I bought three pairs; two were gifts. I also purchased the hard cases for them."

Found out that it works as a Xbox One mic. Worth every penny, now."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price. Very comfortable for average head size. The best $20 over the ear headphones on the market.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,nice fit for my 5 year old. took a star off bc the ear pad feel off after 3 wks. it was somewhat difficult to reattach but i was successful after several tries. hopefully it lasts
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have two colors of these and FINALLY i found pairs that two daughters love without squeezing their heads and ears. One daughter is 5'5"" and 145 lbs and the other is petite 50 lbs 50 inches ... they say they are like wearing clouds"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and very comfortable on the ears. Not too tight and it conveniently folds together when I need to pack it for toddlers travel. Also cord has shoe string material on top which is great in keeping it from pulling or ripping with the little one.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sturdy headphones, decent sound quality (especially for the price), fold up neatly, nicely padded headband, the woven cover on the cable was unexpected but adds to the overall feeling of quality. Thinking about buying another set in green for my kiddo.
Held a star back because after prolonged wear (three hours or so) they hurt my ears a bit. Softer padding or bigger earpieces may be better."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for everything! To include talking on the phone during my walks. They truly do the JOB!
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the sound is great, but you cant wear them for too long because they clamp down on your ears too tight. bought them in august and now its december and the bit the connects into the computer came off. very dissapointed, was hoping it would last at least a year."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Disclosure: I did receive these at a discount (not free) to review them, but all thoughts and opinions and photographs are my own.
I was immediately drawn to these because I knew my 9 year old daughter would LOVE the colors, and she does. She was so excited to get her own pair of over the ear headphones because she says that sometimes her ears get sore from using the ear buds that she has for school (which they need them to be buds because of space/storage issues) but not at home. She likes that they have very soft ear muffs and she likes that they have noise cancelling features so she can do her thing on her tablet without hearing her brother on his tablet (mom on the other hand has had to learn that she may not hear me if she is wearing them). It does have the ability to pause/play music or answer/end calls but she hasn't had a need to figure that out yet. She said she also likes that the headband part is adjustable.
Even though space is not an issue, I like that these fold up nicely as you can see in the picture because it makes them more compact for when we are traveling.
I really like that the cord is covered with a braided fabric so that they can stand up to any abuse that a child does to it by twisting and wrapping and not break like has happened with plastic cords."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Most of the time only one side works. They were a waste of money and I now have to buy another set of headphones.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work great with my iPhone and they look great as well. No issues with sound quality and they fold up which is nice. I only gave them a 4 because they are pretty snug on my ears and if I'm wearing earrings they press the earrings into my head which can hurt a bit. Take your earrings off and enjoy these great headphones
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,my son loves these head phones! I ordered a pair for my daughter as well only the pink and back and she loves hers just as much. they never complain that their ears hurt or that they are uncomfortable!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second time buying these headphones as my first pair was taken from me ( from a family member who fell in love with them). So I decided to buy another pair so I could have my own headphones again.

The first thing you will notice about these headphones versus others of similar price points, is that these ones can be folded in. Personally, I can take or leave this feature.

Next, is They are more comfortable than some I have bought in the past. This feature I love!!! Extra padding = less pain. Always a plus.

I know that in the advert, these are show cased as being more for kids, but they fit my head just fine and my husband's as well. And why should the kids get all the fun?

The sound quality is okay. Not bad but not the best out there either. However, for around twenty bucks, I am not going to complain since it gets the job done.

Another cool feature is the optional mic. You can turn it on or off by pushing a little button that's located on the wire. And it's compatible with my phone so I like it.

Last but certainly not least is the color. I got the hot pink ones. Love the color!!!

Obviously I like these headphones since this is my second time purchasing them. For the price I think you can't go wrong. Only downside I can see with these that may pose an issue is when you go to adjust them, you have to pull on them to lengthen them and when you do this they feel a bit stiff and make a clicking noise, which I think might be Normal for this type of phones. ."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 11 year old daughter. The color is really nice and she absolutely loves them! She uses them on a daily basis for long periods of time. We've had them for 3-4 months and they already have a short in them where only one side has sound coming out of it. She still loves them though and hasn't complained. So a 3 star review for the awesome headphones that lasted 3-4 months.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are comfortable headphones that fit well over the ear to block out external sounds. I have enjoyed using these headphones with mic during conference calls I have taken on both my cell phone and computer. It also fits my 5 year old child very well when using a tablet traveling. I have not found any issues with the quality. The color pops and I have received compliments on it. I would buy these headphones again in the future if needed.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, very comfortable, stylish. I've had mine for at least six months now, and they work perfectly. The bass could be a little deeper I suppose, but for the money, I really shouldn't complain. People compliment me on how stylish they look too!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and they stay put on my smallish adult head without slipping. They are not noise canceling, but they do help block out a lot more outside noise than my other headphones, especially if I'm playing more aggressive music."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my daughter to use at school. They survived kindergarten and have made it through 1st grade as well and they are still working. The nylon wrapped cord has really held up.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous product! Bought for my Father, and then again for my Uncle. They are able to listen, and background noise does not bother them."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well for the first two months.
One side lost sound in the third month.
Totally no sound after 5 and a half month...

Attractive appearance though...But it doesn't matter anymore..."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I expected for the product to arrive the day it was initiated but got it the next day. This headphone was worth the wait :) and I'm liking the quality it's giving off. My ear drums are happy:) ...I had my mother tried it on and she wants one too lol. I'm buying one for my mother and another to my girlfriend. Got to keep them both happy hehe
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were purchased for my 9 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. Initially, they seemed to work just fine, but after 11 days of use one side completely stopped working. The other pair I received is still fully functional, but the audio on it seems significantly lower than when we initially purchased them."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very please with these headphones. It is easy to adjust them. The sound is very good. They are light weight. I do give this warning the orange color is very bright. You will be noticed.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poorly made, ear piece fell off within first week of purchase"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great! The only downfalls that I found were the following; the cord is a cloth fabric, which will in result lead to being very dirty if you purchase this item for a young child (I bought for my 8 year old) and I find they fit around the ears a little too tight to feel a little uncomfortable for my preference. When my box arrived the amazon box was in tact well, however the headphones were inside a saturated box that was literally falling apart when I picked it up. The headphones do not seem damaged"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Order these for a birthday present, they've been used twice and keep shorting out. The sound is distorted in the ear piece and the only way to make it stop is to hold the wire at a certain angle. Very disappointed!!!"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love these so much. This is our 4th pair. My 11 year old uses hers daily and is pretty rough on them. They last about a year or so for her. Great price great product
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted one month!!!!!!!!!!!! I expected better after looking at the reviews. Very disappointed.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll admit I was really afraid these would not be comfortable. Most of the ""earbuds"" never work for me and always fall out. But headsets that cover the ears have, in the past, hurt my ears (should I admit I have big ears?). These are awesome. I've been using them a lot, for conference calls when working from home, watching Netflix on my laptop, listening to music on my phone at work. My ears haven't sweat with them either (yes that was a thing for me before)."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my daughter. She loves using them and they fold up nicely for carrying in her backpack. The only feedback that she gave me is that they do not sound as loud as some other headsets that she has been using. She uses them for school and a digital music class that they are taking. She has been using them for over a month and they have withstood the daily abuse of going into her locker and back into her backpack. They look great and do not show any wear and sound just as good as when I purchased them.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my daughter. She loves them. The thing I like is that the cord is wrapped in cloth, so I expect they'll last longer than all the others we've gone through."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Adorable and nice! Great soft feel. The only thing I wish they had was a volume control, but other than that they're awesome! Fit my 6 yr old okay and she has a head the same size as my 9 yr old. Probably best for someone 12 and up, but she LOVES them and they work for her."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my teenage daughter. She loves it. Very comfort ear pad, great quality, clear sound, foldable design. Almost no sound leak."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones to listen to my computer. Good sound, good quality, comfortable to wear, fit adults."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to buy these because of the price.
I love my beatz but I needed headphone when those needed to be recharged. These are perfect for my office."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought to use for now until I can invest in a more expensive headset but honestly this blew my mind! The only problem I had was that one of the ear pieces came off and luckily I didn't just toss them, because I showed them to my mom and she figured out how to get it back on. Phew! Even has pause button for phone calls. Great quality. Kept me sane on my family trip that was 16 hrs one way."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones work well so far (I've had them for just over a week, with daily use). I use them to plug into my laptop for watching movies, mostly. They're comfortable, and I like that the cord is long and wrapped so that it doesn't twist or tangle badly. The design is pretty comfortable for long wear and they're cute as heck, which is one reason I bought them. Pretty happy with these headphones over all."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 6 year old to replace her old ones. She loves these so much! She was mad I didn't buy her these in the first place. Super comfortable.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset work great! Good sound, comfortable to wear for a couple of hours. I did not catch that they also have a microphone. Definitely worth the money."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headsets. I bought one for myself, my sister, and fiance and we all feel the same. You can easily use this as a headset for your phone as well."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound but very weak. they broke when I put them on my head, the speaker fell off lol."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for my daughter (2nd grade) so that she can use with the school computers because ear buds hurt.

First, it's nice to have choice in color. Second, the product arrived a few days earlier than expected with standard free shipping.

The headphones themselves are light and comfortable for my daughter. Now she won't bring them to school because she likes listening to music at home with them."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband can listen to his audible books on his kindle, and I can read mine. So much nicer than trying to read with him listening. Would buy again."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased two.. Hinge pin popped out and broke the shoulder retaining it... Ear foams pop off twice a week. Quality not there.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this as a birthday gift for an little boy who was turning 8, and he LOVES it. this is easy to adjust, and he says it is comfy."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got these as a gift for my son for Christmas. Purchases in December and shot in April. 4 Months. Do yourself a favor and pay more for higher quality. I purchased these because of the great reviews.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't do a great job at blocking out external noise. Wire is also reallyyyyy long but that is better than short. Picks up your voice well when on the phone.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are on my sons head all the time, he loves them, now my daughter wants a pair too!"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, work beautifully. The only problem....they were so good (for movies on an airplane) that my husband stole them from me! Just ordered a second set!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great for my daughter to watch her tablet in peace for us parents. The only small issue is the audio cord is attached at the headphones. Not a big enough issue to deduct a star. I do like detachable cables however in case the cord breaks, dog chews it or a kid damages it or an end. For the price these are great."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is cute, and voice quantity is not bad at all with affordable price. My sister loves it a lot."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 6 year old and she loves them. They fit her head well, which was the most important for me. She loves the volume and playback control in the cord."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter used these headphones for only 2 months and then the product failed. Only one side of the headphones has sound now. I am very disappointed that she got so little use out of them. Manufacturers just don't build products with pride anymore.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones fit over the ear and are quite comfortable. They work very well and are gorgeous！And the color is really cool!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is in love with her new headphones. They are gorgeous - just like pictured and work wonderfully.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 1st grade daughter needed a pair of headphones for school. She likes the color. I like that they are sturdy and fit her head well.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For some reason these do not work in our car, but with every other piece of technology it has worked! Great product!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ailihen 135 Stereo lightweight foldable headphones are very nice. I have them plugged in to my laptop, but I could see me use them to listen to my phone."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the headphones did NOT work properly and had to RETURN them...very DISAPPOINTED being yhis was my THIRD PAIR.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would recommend looking at other headphones in this style, but not from this brand.
No Hate, just dont enjoy the Quality of the headphones (feels like it was glued together.)

I mean the sound quality isnt terrible but its nothing to write home about.
Probably going to give away as a gift, would suit someones needs!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. I use them at my office job. Good sound, can't hardly hear anything around me, the cord is long and the ear pads are comfy. I do need to take my glasses off otherwise the pressure hurts, but by themselves these are fantastic. Way better than the price would make me think they would be."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product looks nice and qualified. It’s flexible and you can fold into a very small size so it’s easy to carry. You can adjust the size to fit your head easily. It’s also feels comfortable to wear and sound quality is good too. The price for this headphone is cheap but the quality is good.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after two uses :( . Very dissapointed!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite not being a name brand easily recognized, I've gotten many compliments on these headphones.

On a comfort level, they settle well and have plenty of adjustment available. The color options are fun too, I chose Orange because that's my university's color. The sound is clear and not subpar.

If you want an alternative to ear buds, and just want to listen to your media in private, these will do the trick. At higher volumes, it's less private, and people can usually hear a mumble of what you're listening to."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for kids. They are durable, and built well. Kids love the bright colors. These are not volume limited."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfy, and I like that they're foldable. The quality is good enough for everyday listening to music on my commute and blocking out extra sounds at my office purposes. They've held up pretty well and the mic picks up well for phone calls."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones two weeks and I have enjoyed using them while studying ( and procrastinating at school).
It blocks out the noise around decently--which makes them perfect on days when you have no desire to engage with the general populace. They are a good buy for the price."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ft a woman's head very well. Sound is good. They look good. I like that they fold.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought 2 pairs of these headphones and they are great.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. The do cancel noise, they fit very comfortably. The colors a real so pretty and the cord has a fabric type of feel which hopefully will make it last longer than the plastic types. My daughter can't hear us when she is in them."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,We bought two of these for our kids for Christmas. The first one the ear piece broke away from the head piece. The second one the speaker went out in the right side. Both within a few months after Christmas. These were cheap so I didn't expect too much out of them. You get what you pay for.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for the price. My daughter loves them and they are comfortable.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality sound and comfortable for the price. Works well with phone calls as well. However, I cant give it the 5 stars I otherwise would because one of the earpieces broke off 7 months after purchase. Up to that point, worked great on a daily basis and was pleased."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound from these headphones is almost as good as a pair that costs 5x what these do. If you are looking for affordable, portable, and quality sound - these are a great way to go."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has used the headset for a few days, the mint color is really cool, it is lightweight and comfortable."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke the first day I used them and I wasn't manhandling them in the least
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are VERY small. I think I have a pretty average-sized head, but they can get a little too tight feeling after a while. Think they are slowly stretching out to fit my head a bit so that they're just ""snug.""

They sound fine. It's nothing to write home about, but that's what you should expect from this price point.

For the money, they're fine. But be aware that they really are just going to be too small for probably most people."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for a few weeks now and I like them a lot! The colors are so pretty, the sound is good, and the cord is wrapped in some kind of fabric so it never tangles. It's a little too early to tell if they'll be long lasting but you can't beat the price! To me it's not worth it to buy $200 headphones so these are perfect for now."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few months back I left a pretty scathing review of this headset. In those few months I have now racked up 40k miles flying with them and can now give an update on how they are doing.

First, they still look cool and the cloth cord does keep it from tangling. I like that. I've been folding it up after every use and haven't seen any wear on them. As far as the audio is concerned the scratchiness and tininess that was on my computer I have not experienced that on my ipad or phone. The mic has also remained clear and crisp. That's one thing I hadn't had a chance to try out before. Now, I still think the headset is made for smaller ears but I found out the hard way that I really can't walk the street with them on as I had a hard time hearing the traffic.

Lastly, the pain that I mentioned from wearing them too long has also subsided. Either I got use to them or they stretched just a bit. I can wear them now for an 8 hr plane ride and not have to remove them. In fact, I even turned down the Bose headset on my flight back from Auckland because I felt these were doing a really great job in relation to the noise cancelling Bose ones.

They look nice and the cloth cord is cool. That would be where the pros stop for me.

Not even 5 hours in and I already have a tininess and scratchy audio from left ear. The headset is also essentially too small for my ears. I get 10 minutes of usage before my ears begin to hurt."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came quickly and is what I wanted. A little tight but for me that is ok because it stays on. It was purchased for an adult.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"From the reviews I expected these to be decent headphones, but I didn't realize how nice the sound would be! Also, I didn't see it mentioned, but that little button on the cord is a pause button. I don't know how it works, but it works both with my mp3 player and with the YouTube app on my phone. I definitely recommend these."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I received the headphones I was really excited. Loved the color, quality seemed good. But within a week, the padding came off one ear bud and now my daughter won't use them at all."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent purchase these fold up nicely, look great and have very nice sound. I purchased another brand for myself at the same time I purchased these for my daughter. Wish I would of bought two of these. Much nicer fit and very light weight."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These head phones are awesome. You cant hear anything else but the music!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice set of headphones I purchased for work. Sound is clear, I just wish the cord was a little longer."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very well made, and have good sound quality. They also block out most outside noise. But if you are a glasses wearer they may cause a bit of pinching on your ears if worn for a long period of time."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for our youngest son who love these headphones. The colors are very bright which is great! The sound is clear and the ability to extend them if needed is also a plus. They are not noise cancelling so we make sure that he keeps them at a safe level for his hearing. Which thankfully with these headphones is still loud enough to hear and enjoy what's going on, but quiet enough not to bust out his ear drums. Be careful, you could get lost listening to your preferred genre and get caught singing off key out loud as though you were home in the shower (I went ahead and tested them out at high level to see how they are...I love them. My oldest son decided to feed me a cracker when I hit the high note...brought me back to reality). :-)"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable, for long term use. I use mine at work mainly, and leave them on for hours at a time. The sound is excellent, and is very clear. I have only had mine a few weeks so I don't know how long they will hold up, but they seem very well made. The cord is a bit thicker than some headphones, and long enough for deep pockets. I am thinking of getting a second pair for home use."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the first headphones I've ever owned that actually fit my obnoxiously tiny head (I wear child-sized hats). Music sounds great through these, and they've also worked well on phone calls. The mic pics everything up perfectly, and my family claims they could hear me better through the mic on these than on my old apple earbuds. I've also got 5 piercings per ear, so I usually don't bother with full headphones, but these are surprisingly comfy! I also appreciate that they come in adorable pastels."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are pretty decent for the price. My package arrived on time, and in a secure box. They are made surprisingly well, and are pretty sturdy. I ordered the pastel blue and pastel purple set, and the color is very pretty in person. The cord is made out of cloth, which I can definitely appreciate for its durability. The sound quality is pretty decent, and I don't think you can get much better for the price. Overall, I would definitely recommend these headphones for someone who is looking for a decent set on a budget. These headphones are also great for kids, because they are adjustable."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my (adult) daughter. She claims they are very comfortable and sound clear. Looks like a good purchase, good price.

Update as of July 2017: One side died after only 6 months of use. Daughter was disappointed, and the return-by date was past due. Ailihen customer service to the rescue...after a couple of emails with troubleshooting questions, they had a new pair delivered within a week. Super friendly email exchanges...very impressed."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these as a Christmas gift. About a month after our daughter started using them, the sound went out in 1 ear. She is very gentle with them and it was not because of damage on her part. I just missed the return window through Amazon, so I contacted the seller directly. Even though there was a slight language barrier, they provided me with some troubleshooting tips. When those all failed, they quickly sent out a replacement. We are hoping this new pair doesn't quit on us again, but I'm giving this product 5 stars because of their commitment to customer satisfaction. Our daughter loves these headphones. They are the perfect size for a child."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprised that these are noise canceling I was nervous about buying a fold up headphone set, I've always felt fold ups would be a weak poin, however so far so good I have not had any problems with the connection from folding and unfolding.
I've read some reviews that say tnese headsets are uncomfortable on your ears after wearing them for half an hour, I feel most headsets are that way until you get used to them I started wearing mine for short periods of time and as time went on they felt fine. The price is great! The only thing that could have made these better would have been if I but hey you get what you pay for and I'm very happy with what I paid for!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, very impressed! I didn't expect a lot from the low price, but I'm quite pleased with this purchase. The sound quality is like surround sound in your ear! Also, they aren't labeled as noise-cancelling, and I'm not an expert, but when I wear these most other noises are unheard (someone has to tap me to make me aware they need my attention).

The headband is very comfortable and so is the ear muff cushion. The size adjusts to fit all the kids, my husband, and me.

On a side note, I really like the color options offered. I got the gray/green to suit our whole family. The cord is covered in a woven flexible material that I really like as well -- reduces the digital-age feel just enough to make these seem upscale.

I use them in my Kindle, desktop PC, and iPhone -- all work well."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely loved these headphones when I saw them! The colors were vibrant and pretty. Here's the clincher: The VERY first time I put them on, the sound bounced back from one side of the headphones to the other-one side had sound and the other didn't. There was also a lot of static and my music sounded terrible. The cord seemed very sturdy, and intact, and I loved how it was covered. BUT the static was terrible. I didn't give it one star because I really did like the overall appearance. Definite disappointment.

Update: Okay...my son used these and say he had no problem hearing with them, and both sides worked. I have since tried them, and they seem to be working fine now. I must admit that I am a bit leary and fear they will start going out again. At this moment I am willing to upgrade from 2 to 4 stars with high hopes that they continue working properly."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my husband he loves them! I had bought him head phones from Bose and they only lasted a year and a half even though the sound was good they were too expensive to have broken down that quickly, so I decided to try these head phones which are priced really low and wasn't sure if they would be of any quality . I was pleasantly surprised to find out they work fine and the sound is very good. Thank you"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works very well for 4 and 6 year olds for school needs. I would buy again
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE 10/22/16 The seller sent me a replacement (see below) and I have been using. I am updating to 5 Stars. Four stars for the headphones and an extra because the seller promptly took care of my issue when one side of the headphone stopped working. These are pretty good for the price. My teams color and I use them primarily to listen to game on radio while at the stadium. I am impressed because the seller did not have to send a replacement. I have had other headphones stop working (who hasn't ) and those sellers did not care. Thank you Ailihen!

I was liking these and after a couple months the left ear stopped working. I don't think the right ear will keep working much longer either. Additionally the part where you plug into device got bent without anything really happening to make it so. I am back online looking for another headphone in anticipation of this one not working entirely.

The colors are great!

(UPDATE 10/17/2016-The seller was kind enough to contact me and offer a replacement or refund. I replied that a replacement would be good. After I receive and use for a few weeks, I will update the headphone review. As stated above, I really liked but one side stopped working a short time after receiving. In picture the side that does not have wire going into the headphone went silent)"
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well built, nice weight to them and sound is pretty great! Can't be the price and quality!!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my nine-year-old. She loved the bright colors. The cord is wrapped in a material that can't be easily broken.UPDATE the headphone started to only work in certain devices.They only work on her phone now.They stopped working with laptop and Amazon Tablet.I checked the other devices with other headphones and they worked.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty nice i have bought some of these before and they held up pretty well
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"GREAT sound quality!! The only complaint I have is how snug they are. Towards the end of my bus ride today (about 40 minutes), I started to get a headache because of it, and I don't have a big head lol. I'm hoping that this diminishes over time and wear from bending them a bit. Other than that, I'm really really pleased with the quality for the price. I love that the cord is braided, too. Overall great quality and great price! I paid $20 at the time of this review."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loved these. Perfect for school and folds into itself to help minimize bending and breaking.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got far more than I expected for this low price. I did not realize that these have the built in mike. You can't go wrong with these light and comfy headset.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this set for my 4th grader for his school chrome book. It fits him well, hr likes the sound quality and notice cancellation is good. He can use it in classroom and can listen peacefully when other kids are making noise too. I like the way it folds and adjusts the size. Another thing I love about it is the wire , it's is completely insulated with woven thread and can easily sail through kids rough usage."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for the wife and she is very happy with them. My only concern is longevity. Will have to see how they hold up over time, but so far very happy."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, and I love that the cord is thicker than normal headphones since I have an 8 year old son using them. Great quality for a great price!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these for my 17 year old daughter who goes through headphones like nothing & she loves them. They are lightweight, have excellent sound. Awesome price. Would recommend."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these! They are worth every penny!!! My daughter is two and I wanted something that was stylish yet comfy...she is a petite two year old so the headphones don't fit completely well but she can use them anyway
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds very superb the sound quality is great and fits really well. Very light on your head. No problems with mic or ear phones. Had it for about 3 and half weeks with no problem.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and fit my small head. Not very bassy but that's ok because I dont like overpowering bass.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm an adult with a tiny head. I'm just naturally a small woman. These fit perfectly for work and people can actually see when I'm listening to music instead of just talking to me when I'd have ear buds in. Excellent sound too.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cute headphones, inexpensive, and they do what they are suppose to."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These broke within days of regular use. Very disappointing. We ordered two pair and they both broke.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are holding up great so far! I love how the cord is nylon covered. We have cats that tend to chew on cords and destroy them. They leave this cord alone.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are quality headphones. They are very comfortable, the sound quality is good, and they fit my 5 year old well. My husband said they are even nicer than his expensive headphones. Great product for the price!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After buying several cheap pairs in a short amount of time, I finally bought these headphones for my 10-year-old and they have lasted for over a year so far!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,love the noise blocking it brings only complaint is it is a little tight on the ears
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good quality and take a good beating. We tried these after earbuds kept breaking.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these for my daughter, however I use them quite often. I think these are better sounding than my Beats. Bright, colorful, and superior sound reduction."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"VERY comfortable, clear reception and GREAT service. I am so glad that I chose to order these headphones.--I could not be more satisfied."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Though the sound on these is quite good and they are very cute, the headphone/driver size is so small it hurts to wear these for more than a few minutes. I have a small size head and small ears, so I think these are much better suited for a child than an adult. The cups crush the cartilage of my ears no matter how I try to adjust or shift them."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a few weeks
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work great and have good sound quality. My only minor criticism is they slide backwards on my head during my workout. Very minor problem considering what I paid for them on Prime day. I highly recommend them based on sound quality.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They fight children's heads great as well as adults. I love the color, how they fold, the covered cord, and the squishy ears. I wish the mute button could be pushed and stay pushed. it gets annoying to have to hold it down."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ear pieces are a bit uncomfortable (feel small for my ears) & overall headphones feel clunky (difficult to adjust). Parts quality seems good & fabric is smooth & comfortable against skin. Have not tried microphone but a bit disappointed that I can't adjust the volume on the cord.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound was pretty good. But after only two months of use they started disfunctioning, and I now have to hold the cord at a certain angle to be able to hear my music. Edited: bought another pair thinking maybe I had just gotten a faulty pair last time, but that's not the case. The second pair has also started the same exact problem as before after two months of use like the last time. NOT RECOMMENDED. DO NOT BUY."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my 11yr old, fits her head & ears great, however one side stopped working after only used a few times. I would NOT recommend this product, spend your money elsewhere. My child was very disappointed..."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for of ear phones I lost. I where these when I'm working out. They stay put, fit well and the sounds good. I like that good up."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so great! I got these for work and I cannot hear anyone when they are on. The head piece has padding so they are comfortable to wear all day long.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a nice headphone, but unfortunately not very durable. The left foamed ear piece already broke off."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones. I don't really have a complaint for them. I like the added protection to the wire, so I expect these to last a while. Durable, fold up easy, and sound fine for the price. Not much design to them, but you can make your own if you're the creative type. Note that there isn't any volume control on the wire control button."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Color is adorable, mint and lavender. My daughter said it has the colors of Ariel the little mermaid. She found it comfortable to wear. The sound is good, I tested it and u can pause the sound pressing the button on the microphone."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,100% love these headphones! They are so comfortable to wear that I've fallen asleep with them on. The chord is not wired so I don't have to worry about fraying. Seriously you will love these headphones. Great purchase
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got the ""light blue"" color. It's so cute. I don't really think it's ""BLUE"" but I do love the colors and it looks just as pictured.
Love the great quality for the low price. Awesome value. Already got complimented on them."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not only do I love the colors of the these headphones, the fit is amazing. The fold up design makes them easy to store when I am not using them. The cord is a super bonus. I love that it is made of a corded material, not rubber! Much more durable. The mic on it allows me to plug in my headphones to my phone, carry on a conversation while I work on my computer. Exceeds!!!!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very cute and comfortable. Held up for 6 months before dying completely. Sound quality is about equal with Skull Candy (the older skull candies from when skull candies were decent, not the newer ones that die after 2-3 months)"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these for my girls to use as their home/school headphones. They are ages 10 and 8. They love them. They are sturdier and heavier than I thought. I read some reviews stating they are too loud. That can be the case if the volume is turned all the way up otherwise they are great. My girls love their new headphones.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great! the price was right too. Would purchase again.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My only ""complaint"" is that the ear cups were smaller than I expected. They sit on my ears rather than around them. Still, they are comfortable and are getting more comfortable as the pads break in."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my son. We had tried the child headphones and he did not like them at all. You couldn't hear anything. These fit his head good and they sound good. Since my son is 8 and they are a good fit, I would say they may fit pretty snug. Both he and I are very happy with this purchase. Especially on long drives because I get tired of hearing his Minecraft music."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke after one day, very cheap. I emailed them and no response or help."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 87 year old dad so he could listen to music on his kindle. He is hard of hearing and these were exactly what he needed.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my 10 year old to use with his iPod. They started out great but after a few days the sound became crackly and then one of the ear phones came right off. My husband can fix just about anything but he couldn't fix these. My son was bummed.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke first day.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy with my purchase, I just turned on the bass today on my phone and it was crazy, I am just so happy. Worth the buy!!! Sounds so amazing!!"

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great I love them I wish that I knew about them sooner
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work really well. They are jot a pair of Beats or Bose, but if you are looking for a nice sound for a smaller price,nyou should consider these."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A blind purchase that turned into the best thing I could've done! Needed two headphone sets for junior high kids...read many, many reviews and compared stats to other sets, including other Ailihen headphones. These particular ones seemed to offer everything we needed and was affordable ($19.99/ea). We ordered the gray/lime and the turquoise/pale purple. Cute without being cutesy. They arrived very quickly and my students instantly loved them. Soft, they fit comfortably, and cancelled outside noises very well. No problems with adjustments either. Just EXACTLY what we needed. So happy with this purchase. Would most definitely buy again & pleased with seller."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with product and works very well. Must adjust to size. Regular keyboard is 11"" wide. This one is 9"" wide.
Once you learn that. Use is pleasant. Keys feel very good. Connection to phone is instant. Open keyboard and it is ready to type."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,After one month it is broken. It does not have durability. It is just wasting of money do not buy buy something which last long. Do not buy
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and nice clear sound. The mike is a nice touch
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess their not awful, but their certainly not good. When I first got them, there was a sound imbalance, so I had to adjust the sound on my computer. No big deal. But I did notice a crackling sound coming out of the right side, but it would go away if I adjusted the jack a bit. Eventually it got to a point where it was really annoying and wouldn't go away at all. Maybe I just got a bad one."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,my daughter now uses less loud music in the room. We love it.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The color is exactly as shown, and the material is nice and soft. The earpieces adjust to fit most heads, and the cord is a nice woven material that seems like it won't crack or break like most plastic earbud wires do."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Cute headphones, super painful on the ears though. They began to hurt my ears in less than an hour and I have to return them. Tried to adjust them but they were still painful to wear, the earpads probably press in too much. If you have really small ears, these may work better for you."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,the product works as advertised. good quality of sound and comfort.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, it does a great job. pretty comfortable all round. It probably is just me but I feel that the padding around the speaker is a bit hard for my liking and starts hurting my ear after a while. But this may not be an issue for you."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound, imo the weak link is NO swivel, so they leak around the ears unless your head fits the exact 90 degree angle, I guess mine aren't..
I would like the same ones with swivel, then would give it a 4"

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,They come apart. Plastic pin comes out and now you have hanging earpieces.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were a giant mistake. After using these headphones maybe 4 times the headphone jack detached from the cord inside our iPad. We now will have to pay to have our iPad taken apart and have the stem of the jack removed. Don't buy
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,We bought 2 of these for a long road trip for our 3 and 9 year old daughters. I was concerned about the fit for my 3 year old but it fit both girls well and they both commented on how comfortable they felt. My 3 year old often took naps with them on! Good quality product with comfortable padding that will last for many years.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones. The sound it picks up is great and the amount of noise cancellation is blissful. However, taking them off after listening for a while, my ears are irritable and scratchy.. but that tends to happen with a lot of headphones for me.

Anywayy! Outstanding product for such an affordable price. Definitely worth the buy if you're lookin to cancel out the noise of life around you."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very impressed with these...for my 1st grader to use at school. Heavy cord, super soft ears and bridge, does fit her smaller head, and no volume limitation which is only good for use with school computers. For music and other things I do think volume control is necessary. Bought two sets-purple and mint green."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality and sounding headphones! Love the color scheme. I use them when I am cleaning, quilting, or just relaxing and listening to an audio book!"

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear pads are quite small, maybe better for a child. After been using them for a while (maybe 20 min.) your ears start to hurt. The sound is decent for the price."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are good quality for what I was looking for (just to listen to something while I'm out or doing homework). The sound is good, and they look great. The only reason it's not five stars is because I can't use them too long due to my cartilage piercing. The part that goes over the ears is a tad on the smaller side, and presses on the piercing, causing it to hurt after a while."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing! Not only are they comfortable, they have awesome sound quality. They also block out some noise. I got these to listen to music on the airplane and they worked awesomely!"
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is our second pair. Excellent sound for the price!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only have had them for about 2 weeks. So far so good.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for. 3 stars because they hurt when I put them on for too long - they pinch my head or something
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our child loves these. Said they are so comfy! Now the other classmates wants a pair
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wonder why I ordered the purple one. But since that doesn't affect the sound, then this is as good as it gets."

After 3 weeks of use, the ear padding slipped off and was impossible to get back on. I tried gluing it, but it just peeled off again."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work really nice. This is my daughters second pair. She liked them so much the first time that she's wanted them again.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones I have now ordered three in May yet order another one

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We homeschool our kids and the chorus of various computer programs running on each computer was super noisy, these solved the issue of excess noise and they work great for kid sized heads. They are super sturdy and have enough padding to make them really comfortable to wear, I really like that they come in several colors so that everyone was able to pick the color they wanted and there is no confusion as to whose headphones are whose. Great purchase!! High quality product!!"
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! These are terrific! I prefer to use a headset whenever I use my cell phone as it frees up my hands and keeps the blood flowing! I've previously used over-the-head headsets with a mic protruding but the volume just wasn't adequate so stepped up to this headset. Wow! What a change! It sounds like the person at the other end is standing next to me!

They are extremely comfortable to wear and the colors are neat. The only downside is they're much bigger than the over-the-head sets but for me, that's a minor problem. Now I don't have to strain to hear their voices.

I heartily recommend this product."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to send back. The padding came off the one side on day one. I didn't even make it through my full workout! I tried for 10 minutes to get the sleeve back over the plastic part to no avail. I will stick with my trusty Sony 110s! They have lasted me 3+ years now. 😊
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These would be wonderful if they would just not break! This is the third pair I’ve had that has fallen apart in under three months. We aren’t doing anything rough with them, just using them. This final attempt lasted the longest at 2.5 months. I’ll be looking for a different brand this time."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter liked wearing them, unfortunately less than 4 months and the padding has come off one side. There is no way to reattach so they are now useless."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of these headphones I have ordered, and I will not hesitate to order more when I need them. They are very comfortable, adjustable, and the sound quality is excellent. I love the cord, as it is heavy duty, not a cheaper plastic coated wire. This stronger wire makes it last longer for my granddaughters. This is a FANTASTIC buy!!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Is titlted so it doesn't fit well on your ears and mine has already broken after a few weeks without me doing anything to them
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i got these headphones maybe a year ago and was immediately impressed with them. there comfort is top notch, my previous headphones where to small for my ear and too tight and they made my ear red in 20 minutes. these headphones have padding almost everywhere. they have a nice long cord. another amazing feature is that say you where going to get a pair and you accidentally pull off the padding for your ear, there is a quick way to fix this you sims take off the peace it was overlapping and stretch the pad back onto it then fit the peace back onto the headphones. overall if you are looking fro new headphones try these:)"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't lie, I got these for the color pallet, not really taking into account durability or anything like that. I was pleasantly surprised by how durable they were. Good sound quality, they are not noise blocking, which is fine for me. The cable connecting to the left earpiece wore out, whether that is manufacturers fault or mine, I am not sure.
However when I contacted INTONE about this, they were very speedy and polite in their responses, and we were able to resolve the issue very fast. All in all, decent set of headphones, and a good company behind them as well."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for about 4 months now, and so far they've been decent at best. The audio jack was a bit covered in excess plastic which I had to cut off in order to plug in properly. I had discomfort from wearing them probably 2 to 3 hours into listening through them, but I'm not too sure if that's because of its design or if it's because my head is kinda big. The multifunction button and mic work fine. I think the internal wiring has started to break because if the jack gets bent a certain way it'll fade out, but it's still functioning alright. For the price, they're pretty good headphones. I'd recommend these for children or people with maybe a slightly smaller head on a budget for headphones."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I loved these headphones because of the non- tangle cord and the bright colors are very nice. The main reason is the sound is good. There is only one reason that the headphones are o.k. which is if you have them on for too long then your ear swells up. Other than that I liked the headphones a lot. It is very good for the price compared to expensive headphones.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. They cancel outside noise pretty well. Light and comfortable. Used my reward points towards purchase. Love the color.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5 minutes after I got it:
It's mint green with a soft purple that outlines it. At first I was concerned with the cord but it's long and braided!
A few hours later:
It sounds amazing!! But the cord is so long ;-; overall would buy again"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,headphones arrived on time and are just what we wanted. sound quality is excellent and they fold up to fit in our travel bag.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, comfortable and stylish. Fantastic price as well. I was worried they may be poorly made but not at all. The cord is more fabric like than platic coated, nice touch."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The soind is super food for the price, the design is cool and the texture is smooth. Theyre lightweight and i seemed to be likoing them alot until I used them for an hour and they started to hurt my ears. I think they should try making them slightly bigger or maybe my heads too big lol . anyway its tragic :("
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super cute , fast shipping , volume doesn't go as high as I would like , but still a good pair of headphones. I really like the cord its super long and it's wrapped its fabricated."

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for the money. The headset is comfy on and the ear padding is also very soft and comfortable and has the benefit of blocking some ambient sound.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"repeat purchaser of these headphones....cute, comfy and sound great! Thank you:)"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loved it. She used it all the time and no complains

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because my daughter needed headphones for the first grade and these are perfect!! They fit her head good, sound good, and are of good quality stuff! I was afraid they were going to be cheaply made but that is not the case! We have only had them a couple weeks so I can't comment on how they hold up yet tho."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my daughter who hates ear buds. She actually likes wearing them.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great set of headphones. Full spectrum including the lowest bass and the highest tweeter. They charge easily and last forever. Headset fits perfect and they are light weight but sturdy. Definitely do recommend these.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall pretty comfortable. I didn't give it 5 stars because the coverage is not ample; i have small ears and these did not cover them. Also, the material on the pads make my ears itch."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The overall sound quality and comfort was great and I enjoyed using these headphones. Unfortunately the durability is just not there; three months after purchase, and with no particular incident or visible damage, one of the speakers stopped working. Extremely frustrating. I would suggest you take your money elsewhere."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got as a surprise for my hubby. The length of the cord is great plus is made of fabric not plastic! Less likely to creak crack and split. Plus they are way better at canceling out noise for both him and me. His last pair were Sonys and i could hear everything he was listening to :(...but not these! Yay!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 7 year old son loves them. Got one for school and another one to use at home
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ohh my goodness, I was surprised with the quality of the product, very soft, new smell but I was even more surprised with the quality of the sound, very nice volume, clear sound, totally a huge difference from many headphones Inhave ever had including Apple, Koss and Panasonic. I love this product."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my daughter and she loves them. They fit tightly against her head. I also like that the cord is a soft material versus the rubber coated cord.

Update: One of the speakers developed a short. Amazing Customer service. They replaced them free of charge right away."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones! Great sound quality. Nice color. Very comfortable to wear. Got these for my little one. He loved it! I’m happy with this purchase.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not very happy after about 4 months of moterate use they have broken. The hindge where they fold up broke and a friend of mine bought the same pair and said the same thing happen to his in only a couple months.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing that has been at all troublesome about these headphones is that the ear pad has come off twice since Christmas . It is possible to put it back on, but it's annoying, you have to slide the crack into this tiny crack. Otherwise great craftsmanship. Fits my 7year old great and the cord is really sturdy which is nice. She hasn't complained about the volume being too low at its highest level which is a problem with another set we have."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Plzzz note. This headphone does not work with note 4 or note 5 phones. It's not compatible. But otherwise it's sounds really good, feels extremely comfortable and the colour is real as seen."

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 11yr. Old daughter...she even picked the color...however, she used them for a few hours and went back to her old ones...she said that they ""weren't loud enough!""...as much as I'm all for preserving her hearing, it's not worth the money if she won't use them all the time...but because they were a good price, we're keeping them for back-up:)"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"****amending this review after a year of owning these headphones, the microphone no longer works at all and whenever I try to use them with my phone they make my audio go berzerk. I didn't associate it with the headphones right away until I started using my regular earbuds again and the issue went away. These are ok temp fashion headphones for the money, but don't expect lasting quality.**** Things I like about these headphones: color, style, nylon covered cable, and price. Things I don't like: if you're using them as a headset, which you can because there is a microphone, you can't monitor your audio going out through the mic. So it's like talking into a mic with earplugs in. Second, the cups don't go totally over my ears, so they kinda smash my ears and get painful to wear for long periods of time, especially when I'm wearing my glasses. They are ok for the price and pretty sturdy, but wouldn't call them great."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter uses these and they fold up in her back pack to prevent breaking.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter LOVED these headphones! The size was perfect, the colors were adorable and the ear pieces were super soft and sound quality was great. My only negative was I didn't get a pair for myself lol"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the biggest pile of crap I have seen. We got sent a defective item, that looks like it was a return and on top of that the fit and finish looks like some 4 yr old spray painted it. It is not worth $20 bucks, hell it isn't even worth $1.00.
DO NOT BUY THESE"
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound great and are very comfy.

6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very light weight. Good fit. Tight closure around ears, and I think that helps them work so well.

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones... sound is amazing and the fact that they fold up for easy storage/travel is great!

Ended up getting a pair for my daughter and another pair for my other son. They all love them. When listening to music with them, I prefer to have an equalizer boost the bass and high end a bit, but otherwise they sound pretty good, especially for the price."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for myself so I would have a more comfortable way to listen to my Ipad.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I just finished a 1 hour webinar and by the end my ears were killing me. My daughter was right, these are useless for wearing any length of time. I lowered another star b/c of that :/

These are really cute and comfortable for me but not my daughter, they hurt her ears after an hour and she had to stop using them. I also pick up a radio station in the background when I plug them into my computer so it's hard to hear b/c you've got two things going at one time. I didn't have that problem with my other headphones."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 months of daily use, these failed. The interior wires must have loosened, and sound now switches from ear to ear erratically, and stereo has quit working entirely. After a month and a half of use, the ear pads started to tear and had to be taped completed around to be worn. They are cute and comfortable out of the box, but not made to last."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have been a lifesaver with my son. He is 3 and loves his headphones. I am very impressed with the company as well. We've had the headphones nearly 1 year, They have a one year warranty. We started having problems with them the company responded quickly to resolve the matter. I was apprehensive about dealing with the warranty process and debated just buying another set, it was refreshing to deal with a company that stands behind their product."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very disappointed in the sturdiness of these headphones. Have had them for about a month and the connection where the jack and cord meet is going. The window for return/refund has passed so I'm out the money. Guess the hunt for sturdy headphones continues.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter needed some headphones and I was not sure which to get her. I was a little worried these were cheap and would sound that way. I am a Bose for life girl but there is no way I was spending that on my 10 year old. She loves them and they serve their purpose. She is perfectly happy with the sound and quality and they are super cute if that matter to you.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my daugther and man, these are absolutely awesome headphones for the price. This have great sound, just like some of the expensive brands out there, but for a fraction of the price. Nice, thick, sturdy cord. They are comfortable and block out all sound around you. Delivery was prompt and there was follow up by the company to make sure we were satisfied. I highly recommend this headphones and Ailhen!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. I think for the price, that they are an excellent value. Fit my head like a glove and I loved that I Could adjust them. Most times you can't adjust them. Even my mother loved them. The sound quality is excellent from these headphones. Did everything I could ask for in headphones."

Jacks cap came off. Poorly made. Dont buy it."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure the product would be great for those who are looking for on-the-ear headphones at a bargain price or potentially for those with tiny ears looking for over-the-ear headphones.

What I wanted was over-the-ear headphones that could accommodate my average ears as well as the piercings that I have at a manageable price for a college student, and these were not them.

Sound quality is good, given the price, but the fact that I cannot have them directly over my ears severely impacts this. The single, reinforced-line out is great, but quality of sound transmitted through microphone is sub-par, and there is a lot of ambient noise transmitted through it.

Color is great, as well as the ability to fold the headphones. Wish they were larger, but they came larger, but they don't. :-/"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My youngest is dyslexic and needed headphones for school. She loves them. They're soft everywhere. There's enough padding to make wearing them comfortable. They have a crisp sound and has equal volume on both sides. They fold up so that they're easier to fit into her backpack, and sturdy enough that they haven't broken.

She does say that there is a lot of pressure on her ears, because they squeeze. Having grown up with ear buds, she's not used to having something over her ears instead of in them. They are comfortable enough that she wears them to do homework, play games or watch videos."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this headphone for my daughter.she like it so much.she said it is very soft and there is no noise in it.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones, they are comfy affordable and the braided cord is awesome. The only problem is the folding part keeps coming out and I have it just dangling there. Just dangling looking sad and lonely. I keep putting back together but it just keeps giving up and coming back out. I'm starting to feel bad for it, butI'm doing my best to cheer it up. All in all I would buy again but I worry about the folding part."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter likes them not sure how long they will last

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is trash but the product quality is worse. Used this junk once and it already lost sound from the right headphone.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered my 5 year old a pair to use with his kindle. They arrived within one day, were comfortable, and the quality reasonable for the price. The braided cord is a plus especially with kids. The next day I ordered a pair for my 11 year old (they also arrived in one day) who likes them as well. We've only had them about a week, but so far they have been a great purchase."

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Currently wearing these right now. I love them. Super cute and comfy, and the sound quality is pretty awesome for the price. Definitely better than expected. They do in fact stay in place while I work out (running included), so that's a plus. The cushions are a little small though, and they're circular, just a heads up. They fit me well, but my coworker says they hurt her ears after a time."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a bad buy, i recommend. Just note its not a very good headphones but worthy for a child."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I personally love these. They fold up well, have good sound quality, and seem like they can take a beating. My one star off is due to the fact that they can get a little heavy after awhile but this is pretty much true for most headphones."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these in the mail and tested them out - the sound is great and they seem to be extremely sturdy, however they pinch my ears after a while and my ears are not very big. My only other complaint is the extremely strong chemical smell that they give off, which I tend to come across often with products from China, however it has gone away significantly."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Awesome have to order more
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great. However, these really hurt my ears after a bit. Too small or too tight."

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seem high quality. Love that I can’t hear the sound when my daughter wears them. The chore is a braided material not rubber so it seems really durable. The elf on the shelf brought her these head phones and she was thrilled they “are her very favorite colors”
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product and service
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice sound and seem to be well made. cool color!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones look great, and seem to have a good quality. The sound is very good and the device for answering/closing a call or song works fine. The only thing is that they are a little tight and they could be more comfortable if they covered the ears completely. Still I recommend the product for its price."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have great sound and my mom loves them. She has a hard time hearing and she doesn't have any issues with these.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a present to my daughters. So far after 1 week, they've loved them and it's been a huge hit. The material seems good and comfortable and I really like that the wire seems a little tougher because my daughters are 10 & 7, so they destroy most things easily."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very cheap item. I bought two a d both have broken within 1 week of use. I do not recommend to anyone
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my kiddo and she likes them. They seem to be constructed well but they will definitely not melt your ears as the overall volume is low.

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones! They are very comfortable and the audio is good too. The price is amazing! Definitely buy!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound Ok, but broke right at the hinge point where they fold up. No way to repair it because it has a little special made plastic piece that cannot be replicated. The headphones are now useless for their intended purpose, and will sadly have to be ""e-recycled"" i.e. dumped in a landfill somewhere :(

You get what you pay for with this stuff."

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great head phones , very comfy and sound quality is good. Im not a fan of the material for the wire but it isn't too bad , just persoanl preference. All in all great product."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. Bought for a hospital stay as I wanted some music to keep me distracted. This was a good good buy - light and easy to use.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice look, good style, pretty good sound. For the price I like these headphones, they aren't quite as perfect sounding as some of the more expensive competitors."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Ailihen stereo headphones are everything they are advertised to be. I use them for my iPad and they sound really good. I listen to music and YouTube clips like the Voice etc. Great value ... for the money you probably can't do much better.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great. They saved the day on a long flight with layers. I had no trouble hearing over the fight noise and they were comfortable not e ears.

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Light weight and comfortable for my 4 year old. Product seems sturdy enough to old up to daily use. I like the fabric cord hopefully it won't split like plastic cords.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 2 pairs, one for my daughter and son. Made a great gift. My children loved the bright colors and the quality is also good for the price. I would definetley recommend this product!"

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality not great. You get what you pay for

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. It has a microphone on the cord for phone calls. The cord is very sturdy. It is almost like parachute cord. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had it for a few months and it already broke...disappointed.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a grown up with small ears and these hurt after awhile, but I like them way better than ear buds."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Its very pretty, the sound is really nice, a long chord, but one headphone doesnt play if your aux is put in a certain way, but its a small problem unless you like it plugged in at a certain angle. You can slightly hear the audio at 50% volume but thats only if you're like, 3CM near them."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, really comfy on your ears. I bought 2 pairs, 1 for each of my kids, (ages 16 & 10) they both love them, they fit great."

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my 7 Year old. Great selection of colors, great ratings, came before estimated delivery date, wonderful woven cord to eliminate bending. Comfy and super adjustable. The button on the cord pauses, plays and if you hold it down, takes you to google. Neat!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Came in with a very strong smell. Upon first play, it couldn't even connect into my Samsung S6 properly. The slightest movement of the jack would disconnect the headphone from my phone so that the audio would cut out or pause completely. Very disappointed."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my daughters favorite headphones! She uses them all the time!

5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Foam part of the head phones comes off really easily. Very hard to put back on. Other than that, good bang for your buck."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an adult with quite a small head and these were a bit tight even after adjusting. They also stopped working after about two months, bleed sound, and the mic wasn't great. All in all would not recommend unless you just want to wear them, because they look cute and don't work."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,The audio is clear and loud. The wires never get into a tangled mess. If you put on these headphones you won't be able to hear much of anything around you. They're a great pair of headphones which I use daily.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a bit tight on the head for the first few days, but I stretched it out over a box overnight, and it's been more comfortable since then. I love the color and the sound is decent. Good buy and good price.

Updated: 2 months later, I'm starting to problems with the cable. It seems a bit weak or frayed near the headphone and sometimes it randomly stops my music or acts as if I pushed a button."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My granddaughter loves these head phones. I love the protection of her ears. These are great for the car.

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice sound fits good on my small adult head
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these as a gift and they came apart and could only be fixed with tape holding them together. Unfortunately it was 30 days after I purchased them and they could not be returned as defective. Lesson learned, do not purchase gifts more that 30 days before giving them."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was part of a birthday gift for my granddaughters birthday. She says they work awesome

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have withstood neglect and abuse from my 3-year-old daughter for several months.

9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my fiancé as a gift. He was wanted something that had bass, and that were also comfortable so he could work while wearing them. For the price they completely exceeded my expectations."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I already bought a pair for one of my boys and he loved them so much that I bought them for my other son. They drowned out a lot of the background noise and work great.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for myself a while back and they've been comfy and cute. Mostly used them so I can game quietly at night. They've lasted pretty well. Bought a pair for my mother too. Not bad price wise either.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,Love the color and though they looked like they would be very comfortable they hurt my granddaughters ears
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones for my daughter. She needed some for testing at school. Great sound quality and very durable!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Color matches pics almost perfectly. Sound is crystal clear and callers would so much better than the ear buds.

The down side is they are a little bulky (not too bad) but I am sure most would use them for at home or even I their office. However, their are those that would easily wear them out. Also, they are NOT Bluetooth; hence, your mobility is limited."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids (5 and 6 yo) love these. They are comfortable and soft on the ears and the cord is long and very durable!
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,comfy and nice color; very comfy for adult female.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 2 pairs of these for my kids. One of them works fine, but the other one doesn't work on one of the ears. For just taking them out of box, I would expect them to work. The worst part is we live outside of the US and a friend brought them to us. So, I can't send them back. My son is really disappointed."
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was putting this over my head and it just broke after owning it for just a couple of weeks.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few days of using these the jack completely bent in half. I was able to bend them back and they were just staticky, but then the jack snapped off entirely. Needless to say I'm a little disappointed with this product."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! I bought these almost a year ago and they are still just as awesome! I love how soft they are and I adore the colors! My kids are really hard on headphones and these have stood the test of time and kids! I just ordered another pair for my daughter, thinking about just going ahead and getting one more pair incase my son breaks his current pair!"
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cord broke just months after purchase. Very disappointed. There is a separation exposing the wire under the plastic coating on 1 side. No longer safe for my son to use.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Super cute headphones, I love the bright color. They fit on my head well, and don't hurt after a long period of time. They have a skip button, but no volume button. The skip buttons reacts well to my touch (one tap is pause, double tap is skip to next song). They were okay for the first week, but then the sound started cutting out from one ear to the other. I think one of the wires is loose.

It's really too bad about the sound, because I really like everything else about them."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are high quality and for an extremely reasonable price. They are best suited for kids given the size, but can be adjusted to fit an adult as well. The ear pieces may help reduce outside noise, but not necessarily cancel. They do a great job of isolating sound around the ear. The stereo sound allows for a great experience while listening to music, watching movies, or playing games on any hand-held or portable device. I was pleasantly surprised to see the cord was braided strands, which reminds me of a chinese jump rope but minus the stretch. It's certainly better than the usual rubber that wears or degrades quickly."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because a) it's cheap and b) the product reviews seemed great. These headphones are cute a very portable. The downside is that the headband is a little too big for my head even on the smallest setting, and sound quality is quite poor. I listen to music for hours a day while working on projects and I was hoping to replace my old Koss headphones with something newer. These Ailihen headphones will not be replacing the Koss ones. However, it's not totally useless. I'll probably bring it along with me when I travel because it can fold up so small."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my nine year old granddaughter. This review is based on the questions I asked her. She picked out the color and was very pleased with her choice when they arrived. She said they are very comfortable and the sound is really good. She's very happy with them, so I'm happy with them."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone is awesome! My daughter love its color and stylish design. The overall sound quality is fantastic, it produces the strong low bass sound. She uses it with her iPad. The light weight, foldable and compact design make it very easy to be carried around. 3.5 mm plug is compatible with all 3.5 mm jack device. I can make phone call, track music selection, switch between call and music easily by using the in-line remote control and an integrated microphone. Very comfortable to ware because of genuine leather earmuff and adjustable headband. Highly recommend!"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these. They actually sound decent for the price, and they are quite comfortable. I like to listen to music or audiobooks in headphones while I sleep, and I've spent years looking for headphones with a good cable that won't break over time. This braided cord seemed like a good alternative to the standard, thin, wrapped wires.

I had no issues with them for the first two months, but last week the connection started getting scratchy. Today, I completely lost the channel in the ear opposite the cord. Now it's just one more set of broken headphones to add to the pile."

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used them for a couple of weeks now during my workout and at times when on the phone. They work wonderfully well. Not a single complaint. They do a really good job of keeping out all the noise.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are very comfortable and have a great sound. I can't give them 5 stars because I bought them to use as noise cancelling headphones and I can still hear the TV my husband has on in the other room when I am listening to something with these headphones.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected. I bought these for my son and even tried them out on myself. I thought the sound was as good as my favorite pair of ear buds. I would buy these again

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great! Incredible quality and I actually can wear them for about five hours but any longer and it kills my head. However you shouldn't be wearing headphones for that long! Either way incredible deal!

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE- Both of the ear muffs broke completely off after less than a month and the sound fades in and out. I could've bought these cheap headphones at my local Dollar General for under $5.00. Thought I was making a good investment but I was SO wrong. Trying to contact the company is like pulling fire out of water. I purchased an extended warranty but it doesn't start until after the manufacturers warranty is up but the manufacturer seems not to even exist. These headphones are cheap and not worth the money.. Don't waist your money like I did.
Update (12/27/2017)
I purchased these headphones 10/06/2017 now they have a shortage in the cord. The sound goes in and out, I have to wiggle the cord and hold it in place to actually hear."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Got these in yesterday and absolutely loved them until I put them on and the cushion part just completely fell off and I could not get it back on. The sound is great and they are pretty comfy but was frustrated that the cushion fell off within the first hour of having them.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,It is so bad. I just had gotten it and I could only hear out of one ear. I am getting a refund. Not worth your $.

4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really nice headphones, a little better than I expected for the price.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is using for her school. So far she has not reported any issue with the headphones.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these with my own money and am not affiliated with he company.

I was in the market for new on-ear headphones after my Skull Candys bit the dust. After doing a lot of research and being very frustrated with the number of purchased and discounted reviews on Amazon, I finally settled on these.

PROS
I used these headphones every day at work and on the train for a good four months. They are relatively comfortable for on-ear headphones, although not as comfortable as the over the ear type. They are also very cute and have decently good sound for the price. Even on high volume, my neighbors couldn't hear the sound, so they form a pretty good seal.

CONS
The cord is very long. Like EXCESSIVELY long. I ended up braiding mine to get it down to a more manageable length, so it wasn't too annoying.
They do start to hurt your ears after 3 or 4 hours of wear, but repositioning that seems to help.
There is very little bass.

The biggest problem that I had was that one day, the hinge on one of the earpieces just snapped. I dont put pressure on it, I'm careful to fold them up and put them in a dedicated compartment in my backpack, and yet they still broke. The pieces are a really thin, cheap plastic, so keep that in mind.

For the price, I can't complain too much, but I do wish they had lasted longer. Oh well."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear glasses, so these arent the most comfortable whilst wearing glasses but that is my only complaint. These are super comfy around the ears, but may make you a little sweaty after a long period of use. Great quality for the price."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced a set of KOSS that had a ""BAD"" 3.5 connector. these phones work PERFECTLY!!!! THANX"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for working at the computer
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super cute. Loud and blocks out unwanted noise. Really long wire. The mix works great.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty nice headphones. My daughter's hair gets caught in the side slides, which can be painful, and awkard. The rest is really good."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved these headphones. Bought one for each of my kids 6 and 9, and they have lasted really well. Had them for months and still look new. Comfortable for kids and adults."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work well. Not so noise cancelling but the base and all around sound is really great. My brother stole my pair so I will be ordering more.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Only disappointment is that it does not work with IPad.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with the service! These were a birthday gift for a special young lady. She was very pleased to receive these headphones and says they work great. Thanks very much!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My 9 year old loves them! Great sound, sturdy and cute. I love that the cord is covered in a woven material. My only issue is the wire from one headphone can be seen sticking out and could easily get pulled out, although it hasn't happened yet."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and versatile product. Super fast delivery. Thank you Ailihen.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones!!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good, according to my 10 yr old. However the cushion cover on the ear popped off. Took a minute to figure out but we put it back on. Also a friend of his accidently pulled on them wrong and a plastic clip snapped that allows the muffs to be adjustable. I guess it depends on the person using it and how rough they are with it."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,if you're an adult this might hurt your ears after a while but still good headphones
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my daughter and she loves them. There have been zero complaints so far, its been a few weeks"
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the color and the sound is good. But they hurt my ears....maybe they're too small for me? I wish I could keep them on longer without my ears hurting.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and good sound, but now they constantly activate Siri, pauses or starts playing music. There’s no way to block headphones from controlling voice commands and music on my phone, so I can’t listen to anything before bed without the headphones interrupting whatever I’m listening to."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,10 yr old son and 7 yr daughter love them for computer and iPad. Great in the car.!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits well, great sound, and I have received numerous compliments on the color. So happy with it, I bought another one. Now one at home, and one in my backpack."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and very comfortable to wear. Excellent price!
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While my granddaughter says they sound great, these headphones mess with the settings on her phone and tablet. They make whatever she is looking at on her phone constantly jump. And when she is looking at video on her tablet, the movie or show will just stop and go to her homepage or it will freeze."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Certainly good sound quality for the price. (I did pay the full price, I am not one of the testers.)

It's very tight around my ears for my maybe-only-slightly-larger-than-average sized adult made head. The adjustments move the headphones up and down, but don't really provide more space sideways.

Conclusion: I will keep using it, I guess. But I would have bought a different one if I was to start over."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,No problems.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad this is an ok headphone
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work well for what I bought them for, but they do hurt my ears after a little bit because of the way they fit."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ear pieces are very small. Sound quality is ok. Guess I got what I paid for.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product. Love the color which is very bright. My daughter loves it. Very comfortable and has the space to adjust. And it can be folded easily.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for a kid but the material seems to come undone easily. Not a long term investment for sure.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These hadphones have decent sound, but of course not as clear as one that's more expensive. I've been wearing them for a little over half an hour and I can already feel a headache. The speakers are small and though the coushioning is fine, it still hurts on the ears after a while. These are probably best suited for kids."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earbuds hurt my hear and they NEVER stay in. These head phones are super soft, with clear sounds (feels like a surround system in your ears) and I LOVE the neon green/gray color. Why would I pay $200+ dollars for headphones, I'm not an artist I just listen to music on the bus ride home. These are perfect. Plus the best part is the wire, it never gets tangled!!!"
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for my mother who is not saavy with computers or tablets ot bluetooths. Perfect and easy to use for her to speak with granddaughter through facetime.

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have saved the day! My work day that is. I work from home and using the earpods that came with my laptop make my ears hurt. These headphones are padded and fit comfortably around my ears. The volume button works great and the mic is very clear.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 12 year old daughter and she said that these headphones are really comfortable and they don't hurt your ears. It says that you can use it on your iPhone and iPod but they work on other devices such as Androids (my daughter has an Android). The volume is not to loud and not to low. Its perfect to listen to music without hearing anyone but also with out popping your ear drums. My daughter also loves that there is an microphone. When you listen to music you can press the button on the cord to pause it and when you talk and press the button then you will go on mute. I am happy and so is my daughter.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit both my 7 and 10 year old great and they are thrilled with them (colors, fit, comfort). They are enough noise-canceling that it's difficult to get the kids' attention when they're listening with them, without the sound cranked up. The headphones are sturdy and made well, have good sound quality and fold/compact nicely. I would definitely recommend. Only recommendation I have or would like is if they came with a bag to put them in to protect when packing in a backpack."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are sized for children's heads.
They are not loud and has no BASS.
I like the color I purchased purple/pink."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible overrall sound quality. I have owned many pairs of headphones and the general noise level of these are hard to hear as far as clarity goes. They sound distant to say the least. I feel like i could buy a pair from walmart for 5 bucks and they would be a nicer pair. Im returning these ASAP and im disappointed. How did these get so many 5 star reviews???
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ears does not work, also broke easly.. really appreciate if I could have returned it for something better."
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my sister, and they lasted all of 1 month. They are very cute, however. Do yourself a favor and purchase more durable headphones... The ear-cushion doesn't reattach, making these useless."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t bother! I used these on a flight from LAX to S Africa. One earphone went out before we reached London. For the rest of the trip, I had to hold and wiggle the connection to get it to work, till finally both ears went out. Rediculous!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price the sound quality is more than acceptable and the design is modern and enjoyable.

Unfortunately they are cheaply made. After weeks of normal use they started to fall apart. First was the mic plastic holder that I had to tape and now the entire left part got separated. Nothing that tape cannot fix but I had higher expectations for them."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The company that sells these headphones has great customer service.

My 9-year-old son loves these headphones and takes them to school with him all of the time. He was so excited when he opened the package to see these headphones, he immediately re-organized his electronics (that's my kid!) so he could have these - his favorite - with him all of the time. He's used them for a week and they work really well.

The pink is a dark purpley-pink and the black holds up to wear & tear without scuffing."

0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My thirteen year old daughter saved up her cash to buy these. They were very comfortable and the sound quality was good. They just didn't last long. After three months, the part covering her ear popped off. She used good old duck tape to repair it, but after six months the plastic bar connecting the ear cover to the band broke."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality for the price. It even kind of muffles outside sounds by just putting them on. I am sensitive to wearing sunglasses and such for a while and can get headaches, but had no problem with these. If you need a good basic pair of headphones that are comfortable get these."

1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,The muffs are lightweight but way too small so eventually after like 30 mins of wear it starts to hurt your ears.
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were really nice and worked perfectly but after about a month or so of use the head phone jack broke off and I was unable to plug it into any device anymore. It was a real bummer. It's best to spend more to make sure the product won't break.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them and they match her phone! (Teal and mint green)
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter because she complained that her headphones hurt her ears. They were on ear, so I bought these because they are listed as over ear headphones. Well, they are not. My daughter said they are more comfortable than her old pair, but on a short 2 hour flight, she started to conplain again. Well, off to find a kids pair of over ear headphones for her."
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,WARNING - Not good quality - no longer using as the ear pad and ear part detached from the band part!!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is irritatingly too long, and the extender expands too easily. If you need them at the longest length (like if you have a long head) than it shouldn't be a problem but it's annoying always needing to adjust. And when I bend down, they slip a little off my head."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my little one, he loves the color and very comfortable, good sounds quality, fast shipping, good service, highly recommend to my friends, we will be back!"
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and the mic picks up great for phone calls

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones work for both kids and adults! They have great sound and block out all other noise! I also like that they fold up for better storage. My daughter has been happy with these so far....if she were to have one complaint, it would be that her glasses bother her somewhat with these on, but she keeps on using them."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful colors and so comfortable. I live the fact that you can receive calls with it! I bought one for my dad, mom and I and we are really satisfy by them!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,The muffs don't fit over my ears and instead just compress them against my head. Great sound quality and I love the cord's design.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered these to wear for international flights. Worked well. Noise cancellation worked well. Not total silence but really cut out the crying babies and also a barking dog. The only complaint for me was I would have liked the earphone part to be slightly larger.
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and plenty of base. Nice color and compact design. Good low price of $19. I'm impressed.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were amazing! They fit my daughter perfect she is 6 and it’s hard to find kid size headphones that don’t have the volume limited. We loved that they folded up.

3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are super cute, I love the colors. Thought they'd be really comfortable for long wears, based on the reviews. Well, the reviews were mainly about kids wearing them and I'm an adult....so after an hour or two, these start to hurt a bit. They would be really good for kids though! Plus, the sound quality is surprisingly amazing for such low-cost headphones. I definitely suggest buying them!"
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is super comfy, my daughters will sleep in it, yes it is that comfortable."

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 pairs of these because my daughter really liked how comfortable they were on her head. Within 6 months, the first pair stopped working in one ear. The second pair did the same thing within three months. But the company did reach out to me and offered either a refund or replacement. If you have an issue with any of their products, just let them know and they will try to rectify the situation."
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My two boys in elementary school love their new headphones! I especially love the cord as it is doesn't tangle and is made out of a cloth-like material.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,a little big on my daughters head but she will grow into them. I didn't realize how long the cord would be so it gets a bit tangled when my daughter is walking around with her headphones on. i feel because the cord is so long that a cord holder should be on it. I like over all.
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound & look good and the headphones shut out exterior noise quite well. However, my ears get sweaty quite quickly and tender after an hour or so. Good for the price. I use them with my PS4, however, the microphone can not be muted (on PS4). A microphone toggle would've been nice instead of the button."
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,She loves them. I like the fact that the cord is very durable.
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now bought 2 sets of these headphones. Bought my son a pair at the beginning of September after I had bought my daughter a set from another retailer. My daughter's set broke the 2nd week she used them. My son says his are the best in his class. They're comfortable, clear, and easy to store."
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,1.0 out of 5 stars,These already broke after 6 months. The circular part where the audio comes out that goes over your ear broke off from the part that goes over your head. This happened when I was just putting them on and not using any extra force.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter likes them
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these earlier than expected and I have been using them all day! They are SO comfortable and I love the black color. The cord is long enough which is good when I want to put my phone in my pocket while walking around. I would reccommend to anyone!
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,yes I like them used them today Thank you.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Earcups are a little small but still great sound and quality for the price. They definitely fold nicely
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphone is cute. The sound quality is actually very good for its price. Can be a great gift for kids.

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These have a great sound and are very comfortable. My kids use theirs daily However, about a month after we purchased, my son had a cover to one of the earpieces come off when he laid the headset on the counter. Sound quality is great, but frustrated because the cover will not go back on so they are now unusable due to the discomfort they cause."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 13 year-old daughter likes them; I'm happy if she's happy!
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am in love with these headphones! They cancel out noise better be than any others I have tried! The sound is clear and the beats are so sharp. I would recommend these to everybody! The colors are absolutely vibrant! I used it on my phone which is a Samsung and an iPad and they sound exactly the same! I love the play/pause button it works really well. I have the purple and pink one but I'm about to buy the blue one right now! I love It!
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are great! Very comfy on the head and ears! I'm very sensitive to headaches but these don't bother me st all I love them. Thanks!
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bough these for my daughter, she picked them out because of the colors and she loves them, they are comfortable and she uses them constantly for listening to music, watching movies, and playing games on her tablet."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! I have a non-stop talker for a co-worker and was desperate for quiet. I wanted something bright and obvious so when he pops up from his cube there's no question I'm not available. I also wanted good sound quality that didn't cost a fortune. I'm an adult female and I'd guess my head's on the smaller side and these headphones fit me very well. I wore them a solid 8 hours the other day and towards the end of the day they were causing a bit of pressure to my ears/side of my head due to the close fit but not too bad. I bought another pair in a different color for my other co-worker suffering the same plight as me. I suspect these would be tight if your head is larger. My head's approx 21"" around when I measured at ear level if that helps."
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great! Love the color.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome. People hear me, I can hear them, songs sound great. These do everything they're supposed to."

2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter so pleased with the earphones. Parents pleased they don' t have to share any more!
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,3.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones were good construction and decent audio quality. They tended to be more tight then I'd like and didn't completely cover the ears.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything we were looking for - loud enough, great fit, fun colors!"
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product

7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son's birthday since we are always asking him to turn down the volume on his Nintendo 3DS.

8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my 6 year old. She's happy with them.
0,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My 8 yr old daughter loves the color and seem to be very happy with these headphones. I like that the cable seems study. She has not had them long so time will tell if they wear well. Unlike the last pair (different brand). It is a pity that they DON""T come with a case though."
1,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 6 year old daughter. She loves them. They are very comfortable for her. I like that they can be folded to a smaller size. Great product!
2,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I'm very happy with my new headphones ( 2 wks old ). They work perfectly with my Nexus5X, and block a lot of the outside noise. The sound quality is very good compared to my other headphones."
3,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves these and said they are very comfortable.
4,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality and very sturdy. It is surviving use by a teenager. I would but it again.
5,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just like the last pair we bought. Just hoping these last a little bit longer.
6,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Believe all the rave reviews! Very lightweight, and considering I wear them over hearing aids, that's saying something. Great sound quality."
7,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased 2 pairs of these to replace earbuds that my kids use with their iPods. These headphones are really nice. They fit is snug & comfortable and my kids love them. Terrific price too.
8,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 13 year old daughter after she started getting ear infections due to wearing ear buds constantly. She loves them. Great purchase.
9,Ailihen I35 Headphones with Microphone Stereo Lightweight Adjustable...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just by looking at them I was able to tell how sturdy they were. They feel strong and for the price bought, I feel like they'll last longer than your typical headphones. The sound is great and if you're one of those who listen to things loudly, this product handles it.
The only downside (which doesn't apply to everyone) is that if you wear glasses, it does feel uncomfortable at first but you just get used to it. It always depends on the person."
