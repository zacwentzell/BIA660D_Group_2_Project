,"Kids Headphones, HD30 Volume Limiting Children Headset with Microphone for Girls Boys and Tablets Computer Laptops IOS Android Smartphone (White/Pink)"
0,My daughter kept stealing my headphones but then turning it up so loud I could hear it. I was worried about her little ears. We got these headphones and they are perfect. Great sound but safe for her to use. Plus she loves the fun colors!
1,"My daughter LOVES these headphones!!! Very comfortable on her ears and they stay in place on a 4-year-old head, with plenty of room to grow.
I love the volume control--Nice to know that it only goes up to a certain volume."
2,"Your search for affordable quality kids headphones is over. These have excellent sound quality and are very well made. The ear pads are extremely soft so they sit comfortably on your child's ears. The colors are bright and fun. There's sure to be one that complements his or her personality. It's important to have your children use headphones specifically made for kids versus regular ones because they limit the volume. This prevents your child from using high decibels which can cause hearing damage. The children featured in the photos are ten and seven. These headphones are perfect for watching movies, listening to music, and video calling friends and family."
3,"I got this for my son for his laptop as well as for the iPad when were are on car trips. The headphones have attractive fun colors, are well-made and made mainly of plastic. It is adjustable to fit the head size and also foldable for ease of transport. I like that the audio cables are detachable from the headphones as when the kids tug too hard, it just pops out and can be put back versus those that just get ripped out. This way even if the cable stops working, I can always find a replacement for it and the headphone can still be used. This headphones come with two audio cables - one which has the mic and one button for controlling pause/play, previous/next, answer/hang up call, and the other just a regular audio cable. The sound is quite clear, and the volume is not too loud so that it doesn't hurt his ears."
4,"Let me start by saying that I bought similar headphones (Intone Ms200 Stereo Low Bass Folding and Adjustable Headphone Earbuds - White / Green) from the same seller (MUJI SHOP) a year and a half ago, and while the looks and sturdiness have been good, the sound quality was appallingly bad right off the bat. I gave it 3 stars as a compromise.

The HD30 here are similar, though with some improvements. The cord is now detachable, and there is an extra cord in the box. They're also volume-limiting, though it actually turned out to be a negative.

The gist is that for $17 and in 2018, the HD30 sound just as bad, if not worse, than the Intone Ms200 from a year and a half ago, except now the volume doesn't even go up as high. This means that my kid wouldn't even be able to hear what his cartoon characters are saying in anything but almost complete silence. Sound quality would be possibly OK for him at his age (5 years old), but I can tell just how awful it is.

And here's the nail in the coffin - I also ordered a pair of comparable Noot K11 headphones Kids Headphones - noot products K11 Foldable Stereo Tangle-Free 3.5mm Jack Wired Cord On-Ear Headset for Children (Navy/Teal) for less than $10, and they sound an order of magnitude better (and are louder). I am returning the HD30 and getting another Noot K11 in a different color instead. One thing they don't have is a replaceable cord, but at <$10, who cares? I'll just buy another when they break.

If the HD30 sounded better (way better), the star rating of this review would have been completely different. I'm docking 3 stars for audio quality and leaving 2 for the rest of the package being not totally awful.

5,"The color of this headphone really pops and very easy to find when it's misplaced. The cushions are soft the the ears aren't red after an hour or 2 of use. Compare these to the regular headphones, the volume aren't as loud, but pleasant to their ears. Especially nowadays kids are clue to the phone or tables. The parents love it, and they can tell the difference, when they use this or the beats. For sure when the beats are in used. they will not answer to the parents call, but with this one, they will.

If you don't want overly loud music being played on your little ones eardrum this product is recommended. Not for a long period of time of an hour should be good."
6,"These kid headphones are working out great for us for several reasons. First of all, they are loud enough to actually hear but the volume is limited a good amount to protect my toddler's ears. Second of all, it came with 2 headphone cables which is a very nice surprise since my toddler destroys the cables about once a month but I still need my kids to wear headphones so I can have peace and quiet in the house. Third, I like that the headphones fold up so it takes up less space in my bag."
7,"Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for our first airplane trip.she insisted on the pink ones, and ,well...she is the only grandbaby....
Anyhow, I received this within a couple of days. I can't tell you how pleased I am with these headphones. The product shipped fast,was packaged very well,included extra cord, and the headphone are perfect in construction with volume control for little ears and padded nicely. I highly recommend to parents and grandparents, if you want a quality product at a reasonable price, these are the headpbones for your child!"
8,"SUPER HEADSET!
I cannot thank the makers enough for limiting the volume so these cannot be turned up too loud! I am constantly telling the little ones that they are going to ruin their hearing, but they don't understand the depth of that statement. The colors of these to choose from are perfect for the little ones - they love all of them! The only problem is that I only ordered one set, so now I need to order more as they seem to not want to share! Highly recommended!"
9,"These headphones are excellent. They're comfortable to wear - my son loves them. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality, too - it's excellent and very clear. He could hear his music just fine on a noisy airplane. I am tempted to buy a pair for myself because the sound quality is better than my earbuds. You can't beat the price for such a great product. I also love the nylon covered cord, it doesn't tangle like silicone cords do! And the extra port for a second set of head phones to plug in to and share the audio is pretty ingenious."
10,Nice kid headphones for the price. I like the volume limiting feature so that they don't get too loud and I also really like how they have a detachable cord. My kids have broken the cord on other headphones by accidentally pulling on the cord while it's plugged in and the plug/cord has broken off. The folding feature is nice as well in case you need to pack them in a bag while traveling.
11,"Our 7 year-old twin boys love these, and they use them with their new Fire tablets. It has volume limiting, but they still seem to find a way to have it loud enough to block me out when I'm speaking... Not sure that's the headphones' fault, though.They seem pretty sturdily built while still being collapsible for packing away easily. By far, my favorite thing about these are the detachable cables (yes, plural) that come with it. Both are sturdy braided cables too. Even if your kid figures out a way to break one, there's another in the box to trade out! Genius!"
12,These headphones are great and just right for my 6 year old grandson. The ear piece is super soft and cushiony and he doesn't complain about them hurting his ears. I love that the volume will only go so high so not to damage his hearing. I was looking for a good set for him when we travel and he uses his ipad to keep him occupied. This is just what I was looking for.
13,Lovely vibrant colored headphones. I always worry about kids turning up the volume a bit too much and damaging their ear drums. The volume seems to be adequate for protecting the sensitive ears of young kids.
14,"First off, I would like to say that I really appreciate the nylon cover over the headphones wires. The ear muffs fit over my sons ears and he says they are comfortable. The headphones break down for better storage and requiring less space. The sound is nice and clear and the cords are long. It’s a good product and I am very pleased with my purchase"
15,Very colorful vibrant headphones for kids. I gifted it to my friends kid and he loves them a lot. He uses it with his tablet and yo he is all set. Sound quality is really and kid friendly.
16,I purchased these headphones for my 3 year old grandson who loves watching movies on his ipad. I needed something that would adjust volume and avoid him being able to turn it up too loud. These headphones are perfect. I also like that they have a L and R inside so we can quickly know which way they go.
17,"I bought these for my daughters iPad and she loves them! They fold down so when there in her book bag there not bulky, they have great sound and fit perfect. She also loves the color. These are great headphones for kids I will be buying a pair for my son. I would suggest these to parents looking for kids headphones"
18,"These headphones do exactly as the description says and keeps it low for kids ears but it seems it's a bit too low as then you need to turn up the device almost all the way up just to hear it.

On the plus side as I've experienced with lots of headphones are the cord breaking inside and suddenly your headphones don't work again, not with these! If the cord breaks just buy a new 3.5mm cord and you're all set."
19,"so far they work great. I don't let my grandson use the ipad very often but if he gets very impatient when we are at the restaurant, I let him watch Dora or Mickey and use these so he can hear and no one else has to listen to it. He loves having his own headphones!"
20,I bought these for a 5 year old who has broke 3 pair of other brand headphones. I cords are so much better than the others and they come with an extra cord as well. She loves. These are a keeper!
21,They are so cute my baby girl loves them they are not heavy at all only thing I really didn't like was is not as loud as I thought it will be but I guess is just like that cause it was made for kids but other then that they are great
22,I bought these as a Christmas present for my son so he would have earphones for his tablet. Shipping was prompt and they came in good condition. He has been wearing them non stop for about three days now and I have heard no complaints. They are a little snug on his head but he says they are comfortable and they don't feel tight. They are also pretty easy to adjust. So I would definitely order again.
23,Super impressed with these headphones. User friendly and my daughter seems to enjoy them. I purchased them so I would be able to help my daughter get use to having head phones in for traveling purposes...love the colors!
24,"I have recently purchased Ailihn HD30 kids headphones (2 of them, blue). We have used them for less than 2 days while road tripping. The cushions around the ears are coming off already without any abuse. Further, one of the headphones will only allow sound to be heard if the mute button is continuously pressed (my 5 yo is not happy having to press the button all the time)

Thirdly, I have tried to call the phone # listed on the manuals and the website. However, it goes directly to the message that says the following: “the person you’re trying to reach has a voicemail box that has not been set up”. I’m not sure what to make of that since this is supposed to be their customer service line. I have emailed them at the address listed in their manuals and their website in the hopes that they will answer quickly but the email came back undeliverable. I am not sure what other recourse I have"
25,"I got these for my daughter for her birthday. Let me tell you, they work wonderful. She loves them. She is still small enough that she cannot keep earbuds in, and normal ones that go over your ears are sometimes too big. She loves that these fit her ears comfortably. She said her ears have pillows! This is definitely kid approved!"
26,My 6 yr was so excited for these. The fit her good un stretched and sound great!
27,I tested this headphone on myself before giving it to my child and it worked just as described. My granddaughter is very happy using the headphones in the car when we are traveling.
28,"i ordered these for my 5 y/o, & she loves them. They fit her perfectly and i enjoy that they have a volume control. These are the best earphones i have purchased for her so far!"
29,"Great pair of kids headphones. I tried them on and the sound was pretty good, didn't seem muffled at all even though they are volume limited. The pads are comfortable and do a great job with sound isolation."
30,"Bought these for my kid, she loves playing on her tablet and iPod, and I worry about her hurting her hearing. These headphones fit her well, but don’t get loud enough to cause hearing damage."
31,"Very pretty design , I bought this kid headphone for my best friend ‘ daughter as birthday gift , the little girl like it so much"
32,"These were perfect for our family vacation! Simple, uncomplicated, and a perfect fit. Headphones are super comfy so she had no complaints on ear pain was a plus! Love the limiting volume and the color was vibrant. Great sound quality but volume was safe for her listening pleasure. Very happy parent!"
33,"Updated: contacted seller with pictures of issue and they replaced headphones so I am upgrading to 3 starts.

Works well enough except the cushion came off of the ear and now way to get back on. If made for kids it should not fall apart in about 60 days."
34,"Bought 2 pairs 1 for school one for home. Home pair broke on first use. Was no longer able to from it. Of course the school pair which she uses multiple times a week is still functional. Never contacted seller for refund, just chalked it up to a loss."
35,Perfect gift for children. The volume control is a huge plus. I really like the fact that I can control how loud it goes to protect our child's hearing.
36,This headphones are great quality for the price! My son loves them! They work perfect with his ipad. They also fit my head.
37,We originally bought headphones for my daughter To Target to use at school with the iPads and they didn't work because it wasn't a straight plug in. These are perfect as it is a straight plug in and doesn't interview with the cases.
38,Toddler loves them...confused why there is one cord for to use on DVD Player and one for Tablet but kids loves them
39,"I gave these to my daughter for Christmas and they stopped working a month later, just a day outside the return window.😡"
40,"Broke after a couple months. The plug broke off where it plugs into a device. Not sure if it can be fixed, not happy cuz otherwise it looks brand new. I am not sure how it happened since it was being used at school."
41,Bought them for my 9 y.o. daughter. They seem sturdy but light. She loves them.
42,Super cute headphones! My kids love these. They appear pretty durable. Good sound quality.
43,"Santa Clause got these for my 7 year old daughter, she LOVES them, they fit her comfortably and she loves that they have a speaker so she can talk to her little friends when she calls them on her ipod."
44,These head phones rock. My girls love them and we added Michigan stickers which made it pop
45,"Super cute and comfortable! Just what I expected, good quality and the folding feature is nice for storage."
46,"These were a birthday gift for a child. The noise control setting does not work as described when listening to music. It does lower the volume when listening to audio/video without music. Overall they are nice and for the low cost, are a decent value."
47,"Best part of these headphones is that the cord detaches from the headset, so you can use them as a mild noise-canceling headset."
48,"I love it , it is very very good condition , heard very clean , my sons very happy have the gift , they bring it went to school . I am very appreciative the sellers , Thank you ! We will buy it again !"
49,"I wanted to love these, but after only having them a few months, the volume control is not working. When connected to a device, the volume automatically goes to mute. When you try and turn up the volume, it immediately returns to mute. Very frustrating."
50,"I brought this for my daughter's birthday. She absolutely loves it, I like the fact that it's come with two listening cord and she likes that it can detach from the earphone as well. Overall nice product for me."
51,Purchased two pairs of these for my 6 and 3 year old. And I am pleasantly surprised! The quality is great! I like the fact that the cord is longer than most. My kids are a little rough on things but these seem to be holding up really well! The colors are great too!
52,Perfect!!! My daughter loves the color and says it has a great sound quality.
53,I bought these headphones for my son and they are working out great! They are brightly colored which he loves and I love that they are volume limiting as to not damage his hearing.
54,I love that these have a volume limit. They fit my 3 year old and 6 year old perfectly and they've never complained that they are uncomfortable.
55,These are so nice. They are sturdy enough for the 4 yr old and the cord are cool. It's nice that they are geared towards kids and still have great sound.

59,Nice quality
60,"Good quality, even have an extra wire in the box. This item’s band is long enough to fit older kids and adults, much better than other kid headphones I bought before which the bands are too short to fit even the little kids. Very pleasant experience."
61,"My Daughter loved it, I purchased two!. I also tried it myself and the sound if very good. there is 2 cable included, one with the microphone, one without. Used the microphone one on face time and it work very well. I definitively recommend this product and this seller"
62,"Very good quality. Appreciate that the headphone cord is wrapped in cloth (doesn't tangle easily) and plugs in (connection doesn't break like other, cheaper kids headphones)"
63,ok
64,My 4 year old loves these! They are made nice and work super well. Easy for him to use and plug in himself to his iPad.

139,"Just received this in the mail today. My daughter (5 years old) tried to put the cord into her iPad and it snapped. Luckily, it came with 2 cords. I'm hoping it lasts for the next week while we are traveling."
140,"My son needed a replacement pair of headphones for his kindergarten class. These were perfect. He loves the color and the sound is much better than his previous pair. If you are looking for a pair that would be good for school, these are them."
141,Our 6 year old daughter loved the feel of the headphones. They are a tiny bit too big still so will grown nicely with her. She had no sense that the volume was limited. Sound quality was good.
142,Too quiet for road noise.
143,"I bought this for my 6 year old to have at school. Her 1st grade school supply list requires headphones not earbuds. I decided to invest in a more durable set after my son broke a cheap pair I bought him last year and ended up replacing 3 months into the school year. These head phones look and feel like they will last. They are heavy duty, the sides clasps inward for easy storage in her desk (plus it saves space), the ear pad is a thick soft, cushy, comfortable material that my daughter loves. I bought the pink and it is a really pretty striking color. She loved these so much that she was using them everyday before school started to listen to her music. She begged me to let her keep them for our house. I explained that she needs a good set for school so these have to go to school for now. I may end up buying another pair because this would be a great headphone for home and expecially road trips."
144,"I bought two sets of these for my daughters for Christmas as a black Friday deal. I specifically bought these for them to use when we go for long car rides and they watch videos on their kindles. Unfortunately they couldn't hear anything with these headphones because they are VOLUME LIMITING. My bad for not fully understanding what that meant. So, do not buy these for your kids if they are to be used in a vehicle, on the highway. Otherwise they are comfy and stylish. My kids liked them before they tried using them in the car. Note to self, do your research before you jump on a Black Friday deal."
145,"We bought these for our daughters classroom due to the existing ones being destroyed and lines being pulled out. These are awesome. Not only are the cords no tangle, they also can unplug and be stored and cleaned. They are very durable and even come with an extra no tangle cord. Very impressed!!"
146,"These are awesome. I think, the best headphones I had yet for my kids. I think they work best for elementary age, with the volume control, but my 13 year old has been caught using them. They are the new hot item in my house.
These are great quality!"
147,"My three year old loves these. We use them for movies in the car and for her tablet. They fit her great, which is nice because she gets very frustrated when headphones are too big and fall off. I also like that she can't turn it up too loud."
148,"These headphones are great! They love wearing them and they're comfortable. I like that they are volume limiting to protect their hearig. They come with two cords, one with a mic and one without (so don't accidentally toss it with the packaging!). I also like that the cord unplugs from the headphone (better for storing and so the jack doesn't get torqued or bent from wrapping). Would definitely ourhase again!"
149,I bought this for my Granddaughter. Her first headphones to use with her kids Kindle. She loves them and they are pink. I love them because they protect her hearing. So many children have hearing loss thats presentable.
150,There are perfect! My daughter is 4 and always want to blare the volume on her tablet. I love that these actually limit the volume as a safety feature and the actually fit her head. I have bought other children sized headphone and they simply would not stay on her head. These are a great fit. Impressed with the easy fold feature as well. She can fold them and stuff them in her bag easier... she has broken another brand that did not have this feature. Awesome product!
151,These headphones are awesome! They are volume limited which I love and the kids love them because they are super comfey. The ear pieces have nice padding and they don't hurt my kids ears. I love that there are 2 cords because my kids always break the cords or the cat shreds them. I would purchase these again. Highly recommend.
152,These headphones are cute and a great size for kids. My daughter loves the color. The limited volume is a nice feature to protect her ears. They also stay on a child's head well. Overall these headphones are good quality and ideal for home use or traveling on the go.
153,"Worked awesome on the airplane. The max volume is just right in terms of not being able to blow your kids ears out, but loud enough on a plane that he had no problems hearing at all. The ear muff pieces do well to keep out other noise...darn kid never even acknowledged me when I tried to get his attention while wearing these. Ha!"
154,These things are the GO-TO headphones in our house. They're a little tight on mom but that just helps me tune the nonsense out =) EXCELLENT quality!
155,My little girl loves headphones so we got a pair just for her!! She really enjoys them and they have great sound!!
156,"These are real good quality headphones,work real good and easy to use. the kids like them a lot."
157,My granddaughter love them and i will say they have a safe sound for children
158,"very nice headphones, my 8 yr old son loves them and they work great."
159,These are great for small children. My 5 year old loves them!!! He uses them for his DVD player but will also use them for airline travel. They are really nicely padded and comfortable.
160,"My 3 years old boy so excited to receive it and use it. It’s comfortable to wear but after few use, the right hand side headphone is not working. Too bad has to return it."
161,Kids love it for color and coolness. I love it for controlling the volume :)
162,My LO loves these. They are soft on his ears and colorful for him. I like the depth they can adjust so they fit him well. They are wired but that's okay. It works well with multiple devices.
163,Very well made! The cord is heavy duty and can be removed from the headphones. This makes it easier to wind up and store when not in use!
164,great for little kids so they don't destroy their hearing like their old man did.
165,"We bought these for our boys to have for an upcoming vacation.
We weren't fans of the fact that you couldn't control the volume at all and felt that it might be too low for use on an airplane - that they wouldn't be able to drown out the other sounds. We returned them for different ones based on the circumstances."
166,Good sound and very comfy. Bought them for my 1 year old grandson.
167,"Great headphones, perfect for my toddler. Seem pretty durable. Love the colors too."
168,Color is festive and my daughter loves it the moment he saw it.
169,"Very nice construction and really like the volume limiting feature, a really good idea for kids. Nice product and would recommend it, also the price is right."
170,My two-year-old absolutely love these things and I don't have to worry about her losing her hearing couldn't be happier with my purchase.
171,Grandson. Loves them
172,The children are enjoying it.
