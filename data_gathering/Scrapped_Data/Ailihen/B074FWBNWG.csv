0,"This is a cute, lightweight and comfortable pair of headphones for kids. The turquoise color is really pretty and the headphones are well-made. My daughter says it is really comfortable and the headphones/headband can be adjusted so the ear pieces fit directly over the ears. The wire for the jack measures a decent 60 inches long. The headphones are also easy to take with you as not only are they light, the ear pieces fold into the headband area so it is really compact. Another neat feature is that the you can connect another headphone to it and two kids can listen to what's playing at the same time! While the built in volume protects the child's ears, I found that when I connected it to the computer and not my phone, depending on the program running, I found the volume to be soft at times."
1,"I teach fourth graders and they have been hard on the headphones I had in my classroom. I bought these because the cords are covered in protective braiding and because this color stands out. Great news: no cords have been broken and no headphones have been ""lost."""
2,Got this as a Christmas gift for my niece! It comes in a nice box and I opened it up to make sure everything was good inside because I don't want to try to deal with a return in a few months. They seem nice quality and feel soft around the ears. I just listened to for a few minutes to make sure they would be good and they were :) I'm excited to see her face when she opens this gift!
3,"I bought these for my 8 yr old grandson who likes to blast his games. I tried them and found that the volume is loud enough. In fact, I needed to turn down the volume on my iPad. I would recommend this product to people who want to limit volume. Can't really address the sturdiness/longevity as he won't get them until Christmas."
4,"We bought these for our daughters classroom due to the existing ones being destroyed and lines being pulled out. These are awesome. Not only are the cords no tangle, they also can unplug and be stored and cleaned. They are very durable and even come with an extra no tangle cord. Very impressed!!"
5,"Fit my over-sized 8-year-old (more like the average 13). He immediately remarked on the sound clarity and appreciated the volume limit as he doesn't like accidentally getting his ears blasted when SOMEONE leaves the volume too high. He says they feel good on his ears.
Quality of construction appears pretty good though he's only had they a few days."
6,"Travelled overseas with these so my son wore them for extended periods on the plane (8+ hours) and he never complained about them being uncomfortable. Love the color options, love that you can pop in another pair of headphones right into these....super great value!!"
7,"I ordered two of the headphones for my children for Christmas. I love the fact that they can plug into each other's and ""share"" what they are listening to. I also like the flexibility of the the headphones. My only disappointment is that I ordered one blue and one green, and received two blue. It wasn't worth it to me to go through the process to exchange one, so I just kept both of the same color."
8,I purchased a pair of kid friendly headphones before but they broke because they had plastic adjustable bands. The bands on these are two metal wires which are very sturdy. I love how the volume is limited. These are also light and comfortable. They are on-ear headphones so they can still hear a little of their surroundings.
9,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them and they must be comfortable bc she walks around the house with them on all day long. I just wish they could go a little smaller
10,"These block out all outside sound. I have to scream at my kids to get their attention when they are wearing these. Otherwise, we like them. Sound is good, color is true to listing, construction is quality. Ordered 4 pairs, all work well."
11,"So far we love these. My kids say they are very comfortable with their ears. We've struggled to find headphones that stay on their head and are comfortable for them and I think these are it! They seem sturdy, but we'll have to see if they can stand up to kids! We also love the idea that they can plug in to each other's headphones if they want to watch the same thing."
12,They work great! My 9 year old daughter loves them! And she has some broken Beats and likes these better!
13,Awful. Delivered September 30th. Used lightly to moderately by my 8 year old until it started going bad by early November. Completely dead by November 5th. Unreturnable at that point. Completely waste of $20.
14,Beautiful strong and easily fits both my childrens' head. Love the colour and the way they feel when they are on! Great product.
15,One of the two pairs developed a cord bind up and cause a flaky connection after a couple months. Seller replaced broken pair at no expense. Waiting to see how long they continue to last.
16,Got them for Christmas and the wires already shorted out.
17,"Wonderful, except, as other reviews stated, they do slip a little bit, so the fit isn’t always great. But I would buy these again despite that and would recommend the headphones to others. My 3.5 year old loves them, and I’m hopeful they’ll last a long time. They seem pretty durable."
18,Stopped working within 3 weeks. Major bummer!
19,"They work fine as long as you don't leave the child unattended at all so they can discover the ""disassemble"" part of learning."
20,Bought these for my niece and she’s going to luv them. Nice price & sweet color!
21,My 9 year old loves these. Perfect fit and great limited volume function. They even fit me and I am impressed with the capability of plugging a second headset in.
22,Love these headphones. The color is nice and bright. They are sold and adjustable. Perfect for kids.
23,Great headphones my daughters love these headphones ... great for all ages ... and best part they are 💯 noise canceling
24,Bought headphones for my 11 yr old son. He loves it and uses it everyday. A good feature is that you can pair two headphones to 1 device.
25,"Great for my 7 year old grandson! Good quality, comfortable and easy to use."
26,"They seem to be holding up pretty good. Got them for my kids for Christmas, so we'll see. Most headphones, my kids destroy within days. Hoping these hold up awhile."
27,My son loves it will be trying to get 3 more for my nieces and nephew!!
28,Work well for our 4 & 5 year old boys. Good they now have their own earphones that are child safe for hearing.
29,Grandson loves these. Great quality. Sound level great for kids.
30,We purchased this for our grandson for Christmas.
31,"It was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves the color, very comfortable and it’s perfect for kids and also for adults too!"
32,My son loves them!! I purchased 3 in different colors.
33,Allows me to sit next to my son without losing my mind or him losing his hearing.
34,"Bought 2, one is working well but the other didnt last long. Had 2 months and already crackling sounds, and sound going in and out."
35,"Working great so far. She’s using the with her kindle. Nice fit, good color."
36,They work great. Its really awesome that they cant go to loud and hurt there fragile ears.
37,My child had these for two weeks and already the ear cover has came off. Tried to put it back but it won't go. Over all its a good product just wish the ear cover could go back on like it was.
38,Great quality headphones. My four year old loves them!
39,children love them
40,We have had these headphones for 3 months and they have already stopped working. Not impressed!

43,Very good for kids

47,Kids love them and they are perfect sound level
48,a+
49,"Awesome headphones. Bought 3 pair for each of the kids and they love them. The headphones plug into each other so the kids can all watch and listen to the same thing, without disturbing anyone else around them."
50,My son has been using for two months and they already don’t work. He takes care of them and this should not have happened.
51,"Served us pretty well on our trip to the Czech Republic. my 3, almost 4-year-old, love them."
52,"So far, there's nothing that I don't like about these headphones. I like knowing the volume will never be too high for my child, and they're flexible and easy to store in small spaces. Love these headphones!"
53,Gift for my youngest to use with the tablet. Very happy.
54,The cord tangled and is torn white is showing thru. Past the return date. It was a xmas gift. Dont buy these dont last
55,Timely! LOVE how well these fit and cover my kid's ears. Would definitely buy again! Have one for each boy!
56,"I loved that the volume is controlled. My son is 30 and has Down Syndrome and doesn't know how to keep the volume down. Would have liked more colors, even designs of some kind. Did recommend to other parents. Thank you"
57,Bought these for my boys. Sound is great and so far sturdy. Will see when we travel...
58,kids loved
59,Great fit for my six year old and love the built-in splitter for side by side watching.The sound quality is perfect and its durable. Perfect for the kids. i would recommend this product.
60,One of the few headphones my son with sensory issues will actually use.
61,My 4 yr old loves them. They fit well into his Samsung pad. Great sound quality. Only complaint is that the jack bent but still works.
62,Product works as advertised
63,Very good quality headphones for the price! Nice that they semi-fold up. Purchased in lime green and royal blue colors.
64,I bought these for my 11 yo grandson. They were too small to fit his normal size head. Within a month the plug broke. Now they are in a landfill.
65,Nice headphones
66,"Comfortable, adjustable, easy for kids to use. Fantastic headphones for my first grader."
67,"I asked my daughter how they were. We just got them last week..and she said ""good"""
68,"These are perfect headphones for my daughter's. They are comfortable, I love the volume control, and they are pretty sturdy. Definitely a great purchase."
69,There great for my 4 1/2 year old and love the headphones jack to add another headphones for his cousins to listen to
70,Headphones are of good quality - durable and work well.
71,Nice headphone. My child WAS loving them but they stopped working after less than 2 months use. Disappointed.
72,Easy for children to use and adjust...very satisfied with this product
73,I had to buy these for my son to use in the classroom. He likes them and I like how they fold up.
74,"Was a present for my daughter and she really likes it, she said it works good."
75,Great
76,works great!!!
77,My son loves these.
78,"My daughter loves them so far, soft and they stay on her head just fine."
79,Ordered 2 Aqua and Purple!! Kids love it so far.
80,I enjoyed everything at ord and and would be ordering again soon
81,Great headphones for kids!
82,"Purchase this, the Amazon Basic and the Rock Papa corded earphones to test and let the kids use them.
The colors were fun and the units were the mist comfortable to ware and say to adjust.
The only issue was the poor sound quality. Made you think your ears were plugged up.
However, this is the feature of the sound limiting feature. But the sound was week, muddy and over all poor.
In the end, these units may get discarded from lack of use...But again, the colors were great and the fit was excellent."
83,She loved them!
84,Stopped working after just one week.
85,Quality product-works as described
86,A+
87,They work really good
88,"The headphones look nice but build quality was questionnable. I purchased for my daughter to use with her ipad and after about a week the sound on one side was inaudible. After asking customer service to address the issue I was asked to:
1.wipe the jack with soft cloth to remove the oxdation
2.insert the jack completely into your phone
3.keep pressing the play/pause button to see whether the headphone has sound
4.wiggle the wire near the mic or jack to see whether the other side will come out sound
5.check if the headphone works properly on other cellphones or laptop
Did all of the above and still didn't work. Wiggling and bending the wire near the jack randomly changes the sound levels and doesn't produce a consistent sound. Customer service was kind enough to offer a replacement or refund."
89,"These are perfect for my 3 year old! I got the blue ones and he loves them. We struggled with blu tooth headphones that just didn’t fit his ears correctly on a flight and paid for expedited shipping so he could use these on the way back. 😬 They’ve only been used once, but are great so far! They’ve held up well to the twisting and fiddling of a 3 year old. 👍🏻"
90,"These were great at first. Loved how they fit, how they packed into a little ball for travel, and we could connect a second pair if both kids watching something together. Seemed like a great buy. Now 2 1/2 months later, sound only coming through 1 earpiece. Worked normally one day and not the next. No understanding why, and the return window is closed. Previous brand lasted 3 yrs, these kaput after 2 1/2 months. Disappointing."
91,"Bought these as a Christmas gift to replace another pair from years ago ... within a week, the fabric on the cord has pulled apart, exposing the white cord underneath. As I no longer have the box, am not able to return, but am sorely disappointed with the quality."
92,Got these for my daughter to use for school. She loves them. They fit on her ears nicely and the sound quality is pretty good. Would recommend.
93,"We have had this pair of headphones for 2 1/2 months. The end of the plug (about 1/2 inch long) snapped off of the cord today when the headphones were removed from an iPad port. Wish I could find someone to repair it, but it doesn't seem likely. Very disappointed that this simple technology is now so cheaply manufactured."
94,This is a birthday gift for my son so I haven't opened it yet but I am sure he will love them!
95,Gven as child's gift Loves it.
96,
97,My granddaughters love the fact they can listen together.
98,My daughter love her new headphones.
99,now my grandson can play on his tablet and I can watch a show! he loves that they are Green and cushy on his ears!
100,"The main reason I purchased this particular headphone was due to its flexibility; however, it is NoT flexible! My baby girl can be hard on things I am disappointed! The headphone works find although her sisters ear piece came apart but was easy to fix. This is pretty early for anything to go wrong from Christmas to the very beginning of January."
101,The cord was broken; we had to use electrical tape so our daughter could use it.
102,"This was byfar one of the worst products I purchased. It was broken when it came in, no aux cable to plug into the computer. I paid really good money for this item, and now I cannot even use it. Please do not purchase. If you know that you do not want to spend any money that will be wasted you would stay away from this. My kids are so disappointed!"
103,"The product arrived very quickly, works well, and just a few comments for prospective buyers out there. I got ""purple"" which is actually fuchsia pink! So don't go in thinking you will get a dark purple. Even the package shows a major shade difference. The cord and headband are made from soft material, probably polyester. The headphones can connect with another pair under the non-cord side, but sound is not always working that way, for some reason. Also I like that the volume would be limited for my small children. I used them at work and they were not louder than some of my colleagues, however they work wonderfully and I feel safer that they are not hurting our ears. I got two matching ones so my kids could not fight over them, and that strategy is also working wonderfully so far. I bought these with a coupon code that reduced the price significantly, and so far they did not cause ear pain when wearing them the majority of the day. They are attractive to smaller children, as well as easy to use. I am hoping that they are very durable too, they are so far."
104,"My 7 year old loves these. It really blocks outside noise. She actually wore them through hurricane Irma and she didn't hear all the noise from the hurricane. I tried them all and was surprised at how great the sound quality was. She absolutely loved the color. I strongly recommend especially for the price. They seem to be very well made. Usually the ear parts fall off, even her $65 pair i bought. These are holding up great so far!"
105,"My grandkids love them! They fit each of them perfectly! I leave them plugged into a spare PC in my office that they use to play their games (primarily Roblox). Due to the way the PC is arranged, I need to use an extension cable for the audio and the plug doesn't fit properly. Since the headphones have a mic built in, it uses a 4-contact plug which makes it slightly longer than the standard headphone 1/8"" plug. I had to push the connector way in (pretty much jammed in), and only get mono audio. It works fine plugged directly into the rear of the PC, but it is about 6"" too short to do that comfortably. The kids don't notice it. I doubt this would be an issue to anyone else, this is a unique case, but ..."
106,These fit my 5 yr old perfectly. She was so excited to get a package just for her and even more so when she saw they were earbands (her words lol). She watches YouTube videos and the sound drives mommy and siblings absolutely crazy. With these on I couldn't hear a single thing. She made mommy listen too because that's how she is and I was surprised by the sound quality. They do not sound like cheap kid headphones. The sound came through really good. It comes with an adapter so you can use with a phone or with a larger jack such as a XBox controller.
107,"For kid headphones, the volume on these is good. My daughter was excited about the color and they are comfortable to wear. My only complaint is the adjustable ear piece slides down sometimes. I bought these for my daughter to wear while she is watching shows on her iPad."
108,"I purchased this for my 2-3 year old to use with a kindle. The construction is fantastic the color is her favorite.
THE GOOD: great constructions, seem durable, store small and tightly, don't have to worry as much about the volume blasting on.
THE BAD: the slide up adjustment doesn't ratchet and hold in place strongly, so my 2 year old is frequently asking for help getting them back on as the size expands itself while it's sitting on her head."
109,These are great! My daughter loved them and the fact that her brother could plug his headphones into hers and they could listen to the same show. They however do not stand up to a puppy and the chewing stage. So we only were able to enjoy these for approximately a week before we lost them to the dog.
110,"These headphones are a good buy for children. I got them for my 3-year-old grandson, and he seems to like them. I will note that he can't put them on by himself because the ear pieces flip up, and he couldn't quite figure out how to get them on. I'm sure once he uses them enough, he'll figure it out. The sound quality is good though. The color is fun and vibrant."
111,My Kindergartener has to provide ear phones to the school for listening activities so I picked these up for her off her school shopping list. Its the perfect price and quailty for school activities
112,These are very nice headphones. The adjustable strap on the sides are very easy to use and the headphones are made with the very comfortable fabric that is soft to the touch. The limited volume feature is perfect for the protection of your ears. I like this feature because children don't always keep the volume at a safe level. This takes care of the worry.
113,I got this for my daughter computer class. Love the color and it fit her perfectly. Great for the price and the headset quality is great as well
114,"Really great product. We use them for computer usage and for piano practice (on a keyboard, obviously). They fit my kids (7 and a very scrawny 5-year-old) very well but both kids can get a little confused with them because of the way both of the ear-covering parts fold in."
115,"Unfortunately these broke. I wasn't able to find a way to connect with the seller to exchange them, so unfortunately I am out the money. My son used these for less than a week and one of the ears stopped producing sound, so only one side was working. Very disappointed."
116,"Excellent for kids, sturdy cord and good sound. Also like how they can link together so two kids can hear the same sound without a splitter. This company also has excellent customer service- quick response when I contacted them. Highly recommended"
117,I got these for my son who’s 3 and he loves them! They work great and are flexible so he can toss them or bend them and I don’t have to worry about them breaking. I love the bright color which makes it easy to find in the car too. Volume control works great!
118,"Got these for my 5 year old grandson for starting school, he loves them, fit is great and adjustable. Won't hurt his ears by being too loud, because they are limited in volume for kids. Great product and great sound quality."
119,"I purchased two of these headphones. I am very happy with them overall. I love the ability to link the two together and the sound reducer for children. The flexibility is great, but the down size is the fit is not very tight."
120,"Bought for 6 yr old grandson's road trip to Wyoming (from Oklahoma)...Mom said they were constantly in use...Grandson, Mom and Grandma were all pleased...bought another set for another grandson for Christmas...lightweight and cushy...survived a 6 yr old boy..."
121,"I liked the volume limiting because we use it for electronic games and piano, compact design, and color.
I didn’t like the quality. After 3 months the jack broke in my phone."
122,"I gave the headphones to my nephew and he loves it. I also love the fact it has built in volume limiter, I won't be worried this headphone will damage my nephew's ear. My niece likes it too so we are going to purchase a second one for her. Thank you for making a great product."
123,I bought these for my niece as a Christmas gift. I didn't realize until after I received them that there is a decibel limit. I thought they would be too quiet but I tried them out myself and they are perfect. I love all the colors they come in as well.
124,"So far, so good. We got these for our 9 and 12 year olds after going thru several cheapos we got from Five Below. These really fold up nicely, too."
125,"just found out headsets may not work with Kindles.... bummer. Have to check each one now. On the plus side, Amazon customer service did give a heads up before Xmas! Thank God for small favors."
126,That's like putting your ear to a lawn mower engine. Safe hearing levels are 80 or below.per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
127,Love them! Work great for my 2 year old. We're taking them on a flight with us. I like how they fold up and that we can eventually add another set for sharing videos.
128,I purchased these as a Christmas present so will have to update the review after the kids use them. Fast shipping and fun bright colors.
129,these are really cute and very well made. will make a great Christmas gift. I tted them out and sound quality is really good.
130,This were perfect for my granddaughter! She is starting kindergarten and is required to have headphones and these fit her perfectly
131,"So far so good. Only started using them a few days ago. Fits on my small, kid-sized head perfectly and very comfortable on my ears which is usually my biggest pet peeve. Nice and soft."
132,"Great set of headphones for my 6 year old. They also work well for an 8 yr old. Good sound quality, comfortable ear pieces and colorful."
133,"My kids love these, we got two, and they did really well for long flights (12+ hours) and extensive international travel! Our girls love the fact they can listen to same output easily and the cables are easy for storing."
134,Satisfied with my purchase. I love the color and it works very well with my mp3.
135,"Headphones look good but the sound is terrible, it sounds like going from the cave."
136,These are a nice quality. I like that my daughter can't play it too loud.
137,My granddaughter absolutely loved these (and so did I so I do not have to hear the game jungles)!
138,Easy to handle. Beautiful color. Seem very durable
139,My kids really love it. Good selection of colors and design. Safe for their young ears.
140,Sound quality is not great. My 5 year old put them on and asked if they were even working. Spend a little more for better quality.
141,"Great, comfortable, good volume control, kid loves them"
142,"Super comfortable, grandson loves them, quality of sound is great"
143,"Comfortable, stylish, and my daughter loved them until they stopped working after 3 months of use."
144,Love that you are able to twist and bend these. Has a good sound.
145,it was broken. i was going to return it but forgot about it. it is now past the return date. the end of the cord was missing when i opened the box. there was no way to use it
146,"Great headphones for kids! The chord feels like rope/cloth rather than the rubber stuff, so less chance of it getting ruined. And I love that they can be connected so the kids can watch the same movie at once!"
147,"Work well, soft and fit my little one perfectly."
148,Bought these for my three year old to use with his tablet and he loves them. Easy to use and seems comfortable.
149,The headphones worked good but the foam part fell off of them after only using about 4 times and we were not able to put it back on.
150,my kids love them..
151,Bought these for my second graders. So far they are holding up! I bought 5 and all of them worked and arrived quickly! Very happy with this purchase. I hope they last long
152,Lasted 1 month then sound went out in 1 ear. Get what you pay for and these were cheap all around.
153,Grandkids love them!
154,"Very cute and even though my son has only used them once, we've had no issue. I love the sharing feature."
155,Bought these so that I didn't have to listen to my kiddo's music coming from their tablet and they are great. They feel so soft and my son loves them.
156,"my son seems to like these, we will see if they last."
157,Granddaughter loved them..perfect color..
158,Quality and very adjustable. Love that it limits sounds so they can't turn them up too high.
159,"Love it!!! Works very well with the tv in the van, the kids love them."
160,purchased these to replace a broken set and also to replace ones which my child outgrew. my kids love how comfortable they are
161,"Ordered this in October for my grandson. Gave them to him for Christmas, this is the end of January and they have quit working. Not happy."
162,"DO NOT BUY. See pic, after 1 month of NICE use. Its just too dangerous for kid."
163,My kids love these headphones
164,I ordered four for Christmas. On one of them the plug was defective. Other then that they are great
165,Great sound comfortable as well
166,I've been searching for headphones to fit my girl's abnormally skinny head( She has special needs). These work perfectly!!! After I tested hers on her I ordered 3 more pairs for Christmas presents.
167,"Grandchild uses these all the time , so that must means they live them very much.."
168,They work good. They are perfect for my 6 year old and they adjust if you need them smaller or larger.
169,"These are great. My six year old uses them to listen to her ipad at siblings sporting events and they’ve held up to her rough handling. I don’t love the metal clips on the band, but it’s fine..."
170,These are excellent for grandkids and young children! A safe way for them to listen.
171,My kid loved it...thanq alihen
172,perfect for my 8 year old. Most headphones have broke but theses are holding up great and love that it has a sharing option for her little sister to plug into.

177,Color states navy but it is more like the color in the picture
