Was this review helpful to you?, August 16 2017,"AILIHEN Wired Kids Headphones with 85dB Volume Limited and SharePort,...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a cute, lightweight and comfortable pair of headphones for kids. The turquoise color is really pretty and the headphones are well-made. My daughter says it is really comfortable and the headphones/headband can be adjusted so the ear pieces fit directly over the ears. The wire for the jack measures a decent 60 inches long. The headphones are also easy to take with you as not only are they light, the ear pieces fold into the headband area so it is really compact. Another neat feature is that the you can connect another headphone to it and two kids can listen to what's playing at the same time! While the built in volume protects the child's ears, I found that when I connected it to the computer and not my phone, depending on the program running, I found the volume to be soft at times.",Cute and comfortable headphones

I tried them and found that the volume is loud enough. In fact, I needed to turn down the volume on my iPad. I would recommend this product to people who want to limit volume. Can't really address the sturdiness/longevity as he won't get them until Christmas.",Product as described.

He immediately remarked on the sound clarity and appreciated the volume limit as he doesn't like accidentally getting his ears blasted when SOMEONE leaves the volume too high.

Quality of construction appears pretty good though he's only had they a few days.",Fit my over-sized 8-year-old (more like the average 13)

I love the fact that they can plug into each other's and ""share"" what they are listening to. I also like the flexibility of the the headphones. My only disappointment is that I ordered one blue and one green, and received two blue.

8,Was this review helpful to you?, March 21 2018,"AILIHEN Wired Kids Headphones with 85dB Volume Limited and SharePort,...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a pair of kid friendly headphones before but they broke because they had plastic adjustable bands. The bands on these are two metal wires which are very sturdy. I love how the volume is limited. These are also light and comfortable. They are on-ear headphones so they can still hear a little of their surroundings.,More durable than others I have bought.

However, just a few weeks after use, the cable started shorting out. I'd expect an item for kids' use would be a little more sturdy than this. I've emailed the company and have received zero response. Buy these only if you have a child who is adult-level responsible for their things.",Broke down with normal use

I got ""purple"" which is actually fuchsia pink! So don't go in thinking you will get a dark purple. Even the package shows a major shade difference. The cord and headband are made from soft material, probably polyester. The headphones can connect with another pair under the non-cord side, but sound is not always working that way, for some reason. Also I like that the volume would be limited for my small children. I used them at work and they were not louder than some of my colleagues, however they work wonderfully and I feel safer that they are not hurting our ears. I got two matching ones so my kids could not fight over them, and that strategy is also working wonderfully so far. I bought these with a coupon code that reduced the price significantly, and so far they did not cause ear pain when wearing them the majority of the day. They are attractive to smaller children, as well as easy to use. I am hoping that they are very durable too, they are so far.",Also I like that the volume would be limited for my small ...

They fit each of them perfectly! I leave them plugged into a spare PC in my office that they use to play their games (primarily Roblox). Due to the way the PC is arranged, I need to use an extension cable for the audio and the plug doesn't fit properly. Since the headphones have a mic built in, it uses a 4-contact plug which makes it slightly longer than the standard headphone 1/8"" plug. I had to push the connector way in (pretty much jammed in), and only get mono audio. It works fine plugged directly into the rear of the PC, but it is about 6"" too short to do that comfortably. The kids don't notice it. I doubt this would be an issue to anyone else, this is a unique case, but ...",Grandkids love 'em!

She was so excited to get a package just for her and even more so when she saw they were earbands (her words lol). She watches YouTube videos and the sound drives mommy and siblings absolutely crazy. With these on I couldn't hear a single thing. She made mommy listen too because that's how she is and I was surprised by the sound quality. They do not sound like cheap kid headphones.

The colors were fun and the units were the mist comfortable to ware and say to adjust.
The only issue was the poor sound quality. Made you think your ears were plugged up.
However, this is the feature of the sound limiting feature. But the sound was week, muddy and over all poor.
In the end, these units may get discarded from lack of use...But again, the colors were great and the fit was excellent.",The colors were fun and the units were the mist comfortable to ware ...

I purchased for my daughter to use with her ipad and after about a week the sound on one side was inaudible. After asking customer service to address the issue I was asked to:
1.wipe the jack with soft cloth to remove the oxdation
2.insert the jack completely into your phone
3.keep pressing the play/pause button to see whether the headphone has sound
4.wiggle the wire near the mic or jack to see whether the other side will come out sound
5.check if the headphone works properly on other cellphones or laptop
Did all of the above and still didn't work. Wiggling and bending the wire near the jack randomly changes the sound levels and doesn't produce a consistent sound. Customer service was kind enough to offer a replacement or refund.",stopped working shortly after using

We struggled with blu tooth headphones that just didn’t fit his ears correctly on a flight and paid for expedited shipping so he could use these on the way back. 😬 They’ve only been used once, but are great so far!
