Super pleased with these! Sometimes you just want to plug in a set of headphones and not worry about charging or bluetooth, and these fit the bill!

Exterior sound cancellation is great, can't hear someone talking right next to you.

I didn't realize these folded when I bought them, which is a great plus. Makes storing them a breeze when not using them.

The metallic brushed pink color with white earpieces makes the set look very high end. I love them!","Awesome deep bass, good sound cancellation!"

My husband bought me similar headphones a year ago (Sony brand for almost $100) and I actually think these are just as comfortable if not more. Plus, they're pretty! Whereas, my other headphones are black and boring. Since my children are always using my other headphones I decided it was time to give another set a try. Originally these were going to be for my daughters, however, now they are mine. :) I highly recommend you try these!

Was this review helpful to you?, November 9 2017,"AILIHEN MS300 Headphones, Stereo Foldable Wired Headset for iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love these headphones. I have a giant head and it is quite tough to find headphones that fit over my head and don't pinch at the top but these are great. The inside top of the band is nicely padded for comfort and the padded ears make wearing them even for long periods quite comfortable. They adjust easily and fully cover the ear to block out surrounding sounds. The cord is sturdy and plenty long for most uses. The color is very pretty as well. The sound is nothing spectacular, but they're great for listening to audiobooks, videos, etc.

Overall, these are comfortable, attractive, and have good sound and I certainly recommend them.","Comfortable, Attractive, Good Sound"

7,Was this review helpful to you?, April 24 2018,"AILIHEN MS300 Headphones, Stereo Foldable Wired Headset for iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought a pair similar to these several months ago. Same brand but slightly cheaper. My son is pretty hard on headphones and earbuds and we go through pairs pretty regularly so I wasn't willing to spend much on replacements. We have been very pleasantly surprised though and the Ailihen headphones have been super tough with plenty of quality So, we wanted to grab a back up set before we forgot what we had bought that worked. This time we went ahead and bought this mid price set.

I really would have loved the rose gold but since these are for my kiddo, he got to pick the color and of course choose green. It's a bright lime color but the metallic sheen makes it really pretty. The volume is very good and preset. Along with the ear pads that reduce any external noise, the volume is significant for a set of headphones. It is also very clear. We use these mostly for video games on the playstation, or youtube on a tablet. Both sounds and voices are extremely clear and easy to understand. The tension in the headband part and the padding on the earpads are very comfortable and allows the headphones to be worn for longer periods of time. The box says it has an inline microphone but I do not see it. Possibly it is built in in a way that I don't notice. These also fold up for easier storage than typical big, bulky headphones. We can easily put these in a small compartment of a backpack.

I'm thrilled to have two sets now and to have found a brand that seems kid proof. lol",Sturdy and reliable with very nice quality

Gorgeous & sleek, extremely comfortable, sound quality is beyond phenomenal and they fold together for easy storage/carrying. I honestly am SO impressed with these, especially for the price.

Oddly enough, you could only hear the background music and not the lead vocals. Weird failure, but it was directly attributable to the headphones. I then ordered a second set of thinking the first ones mightâ€™ve just been defective, this time the left speaker kept fading in and out. You could readjust the headphone jack to get it to work, but it was certainly not reliable. I tried to headphones on other devices and found the same issues, so itâ€™s not the device my daughter is using. I wonâ€™t be buying another set of these, but will be exploring other options.","Beautiful headphones, but Iâ€™ve had to sets fail already"

I let my 4 year old wear them some times. At first I thought they wouldnt expand out to fit my head but found out if you pull them a little harder its (hard to notice at first) they do adjust.

Good construction. Color is bright and pretty.

These were delivered to my April 7 of 2018, and tonight, at 11:30 pm April 14, the weight of the wire falls in such a way at the connecting port that the audio sounds like it's underwater. The only time I've had a faster kill time were headphones that were unusable right out of the box.
