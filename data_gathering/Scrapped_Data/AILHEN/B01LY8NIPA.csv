I purchased these headphones for my 82 year old dad for Christmas. He needed a pair of headphones to listen to the TV while running on a treadmill. I saw in other reviews that these headphones block out noise that is around you. Even though my dad is a young 82 year old, his hearing is that of a person his age. He loves these headphones and said they really do cut out the noise of the treadmill so he can hear the TV. I am very happy with this purchase!",I am very happy with this purchase

Was this review helpful to you?, December 28 2016,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging was nice and was folded into a plastic mold. A plus for the folding! The cups on the headphones are somewhat comfortable and so is the band. The cable that is used to plug into devices is wrapped making it stronger. The sound is not really that crisp but the bass is pretty good. Lastly, the microphone is decent and can pick up sounds of you talking without the mic being held up to the mouth. All in all, it's great!","Actually, Pretty Great!"

Sound is really good and you can hear the quality of the speakers. Comfortable to wear and stretchable with soft ear paddings. The body is made from plastic which I really don’t mind since it is durable and the cable is nylon braided which is a plus. Also, the earpads are foldable so you can carry it with you easily.",Great headphones

And, frankly, sometimes I just want to plug in and start listening to music without connecting, etc. I'd had a pair of Philips corded headphones with reasonable sound (I'm not an audiophile) that just wore out. So, I went to Amazon to find a replacement. I'm so glad I found these -- they're perfect! Compact (they fold), reasonably priced, and best of all, the sound is great!!","Great Sound, Reasonable Price!"

Was this review helpful to you?, November 18 2016,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones were actually very comfortable, even more comfortable than a MUCH more expensive pair of headphones i owned, and i can wear the AILIHEN headphones longer than i could the expensive pair.

Cancels noise pretty well, almost completely. I can skateboard and not hear the wheels clacking over the sidewalk.

Headphone quality was WAY better than the price leads you to believe, it was almost as good, (like 99% as good) as the WAY MORE EXPENSIVE PAIR i bought.

I've only had them a week or so, so i dont know how long they'll last. I'll update you if/when they break. NOTe: Expensive pair broke six months in.

Overall: Great Headphones, look nice, sound nice, feel nice. The red and black were my favorite color, went with gold though, check all colors before you make your decision.",Fantastically Comfy and Incredible Sound

Was this review helpful to you?, December 29 2016,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, this is a cheaper version of those expensive ""Beats by Dre"" headsets, and it is modeled to look like them. Speaking as a consumer, and as a father, I'd rather not pay $100+ for a brand name, and so I am glad to go with this option rather than the more expensive brand with identical performance.

Apart from the looks, the only thing wrong with these headphones is the length of the cord. A slightly longer cord, with some sort of soft plastic bracket to limit the length or draw the cord into a bunch, would really have gone a long way toward hitting the 5-star goal.

Sound quality is the same as any non-HD high quality headset. There are not really any noise-cancellation features, other than some padding along the ears, so take that as you will.

All-in-all, great headphones for the cost.",Value Beats headphone knockoffs.

Was this review helpful to you?, March 24 2017,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first read other people reviews I said to myself what? I have expensive headphones people describing this with a great sound and very comfortable. Still I was skeptic but something in the back of my head said to me it is only 20.00 dollars if they do not meet your expectation send them back or just toss them.
I got them first impression counts a lot the package was really neat. When I used them for the first time I was very surprised by the sound. To make a long story short I took it for my workout I have to say I loved the sound I am really impressed, what the heck I paid so much for other headphones that does not have nearly a bass sound, I am very picky when it comes to headphones I need to feel I listening to music in crystal clear way. These phones delivers that, my son who is a DJ could not believe it so I guess I will be buying a second set for him.",From skeptical to believer

Feel good on my head and my ears, the fit is perfect for me and they sound great. I'm an older person and love that I can finally hear all the sounds in the music again! Beautiful highs, midtones and nice deep base! Pretty good at noise cancelling too, sometimes I don't really want that feature though. There are times when I want to be able to hear the outside world, for safety. But I'll just use another pair for those times. I also love that they fold up so it's easy to tuck them away in a pocket. Another thing I especially like is the braided cord...that was a wonderful idea!!! I took one star off because they won't go up as loud as I normally like, but that's just me. ( I put the 5th star back on because since they won't go as loud as this old hippy would like, that means I won't need another set of headphones without noise cancellation after all! ) This is obviously a good thing!",So happy with this purchase!!!
3,Was this review helpful to you?, April 17 2018,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my grandson, thinking he could use them while playing his video games on the XBox. It's entirely possible I didn't read all the information provided. Since I did read it had a microphone attached which is supposed to work with all sorts of devices, I figured it would work for an Xbox too. It does not. To be more accurate, it sort of works, but not well. My grandson says his friends can't hear him well or properly (cuts out a lot) when he tries using it with the video games, so it's very frustrating for him & the other kids trying to play. I count that as being worthless for video games.
At least it IS a good headset for listening to music on his cell phone &/or tablet. Must just be the microphone that's sub-par.

[side-note: I'm pretty sure I initially tried to purchase these as a lightening deal. Has any one else noticed Amazon's lightening deals expire far sooner than the site says they should??]","Great for listening, not good for talking"

First there is the quality of the sound and the base which is actually amazing. The ear pads cover the ears completely and do help to eliminate some exterior noise. As far as the performance with the Audio I was very pleased, however about two days after the eligible date for returning the item past. The cord broke at the microphone.

If he was rough with his stuff I wouldn’t take a star at all but since he treated them like his baby I’d hope they would last a couple years let alone less than one. Still, I’d say it’s a good deal. I’d give 3.5 if I could.

If I hear from someone who thinks get xan/should make it right I’ll update this review.",Nice sound and style. Didn’t last as long as I’d expect even for the price. Still a good deal.

I puchased this headphone and the i35 in May. 2 weeks after purchased, the tip of this headphone connector came off in my kindle. I assumed my one son must have been rough with it and threw the headphones away and took the loss. One month later in July while travelling, the tip of the i35 connector also came off in my other son's ipad. This son is older and has never had this problem with headphones. Although both are comfortable, be very careful as I now have to take both digital devices to a repair shop to get the tips out and must now order 2 more headphones. BUYER BEWARE.",Poor connectors

I bought two for us to use on a trip. For the low price I was surprised at how well they are constructed. They fold up nicely to put in my carry-on bag. They are also very comfortable to wear with just the right amount of pressure on the ears. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for good ones for movies or music.,Very good quality headphones

The sound is good, they're comfy and I like that they are collapsible. But unfortunately, a few weeks after I got them they started malfunctioning. They randomly activate Siri or pause something I'm watching or randomly start music. Occasionally it's because I've accidentally pressed the remote button, but more often it's just a random occurrence. As you can imagine it gets pretty irritating. I haven't used the microphone and I'd be afraid they'd randomly hang up on someone I might be speaking with.",Remote malfunctions

8,Was this review helpful to you?, December 26 2016,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were a Christmas gift for my son for gaming . So far he loves them and is very impressed with the quality and the sound ! they came very quickly and the packaging was excellent ! My son and I are both very impressed with the high quality and attention to detail . They appear to be made to last for a long time. I would recommend purchasing these . Update .. I'm sad to say that after 3 months use one speaker has already quit working . My son is very careful with these and can't understand how they could malfunction so quickly. Very disappointing as he loved them. Now it's too late to return through Amazon so I'm hoping I can contact the manufacturer for a replacement . This is the 2nd pair we have purchased . The first ones lasted 6 months but it was too late to ask for a replacement . If I can't get a replacement this time then I will find a different brand for next purchase.,Excellent High Quality/Not long lasting

We have bought several off brand options before and were disappointed with the fit and comfort, however these are very comfortable both around the ears and over your head. The foldable feature is also really nice. The only reason that I'm rating these 4 instead of 5 stars is that the sound quality is not quite as great as we had hoped and you can definitely hear what someone is listening to when they have them on. I still think they were wonderfully priced on sale for the quality we got and would recommend to anyone that isn't looking to spend a fortune on some comfortable, portable headphones, just don't expect them to be 'noise canceling'.",Great quality for the price point

No major complaints here, however I will say that I feel the sizing on these headphones is on the petite side, better suited for women or adolescents perhaps as my husband's head was too large for these to be comfortable on him. I found them a perfect fit myself though, and plan to keep them!",Excellent buy!

5,Was this review helpful to you?, December 8 2016,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I own and operate my own recording studio and own several different pairs of headphones ranging in quality. I ordered the i60's after my old pair of Skullcandy Hesh wore out, just as a casual listening pair while I'm traveling, writing, etc.

What must be understood is that these headphones are affordable for a reason. They are not high-end and the sound quality is ok but not great. They are a little bassy as over-ear headphones can be but the clarity is significantly less than what you would get with a better pair of headphones.

That said, the value is pretty outstanding. The cord is long and covered with a sturdy woven material, the headpiece is comfortable and they fold up nicely. For under $20, it's a good buy. Just don't expect them to sound crystal clear or to be good for any serious or professional listening.",You Get What You Pay For

The headphones snapped and broke in the headband while just sitting on my head, 9 months into ownership. I am dissapointed.
*********
So I had to really think about how I wanted to review this product. Here goes:

What you're getting: Really good $20 headphones.
What you're not getting: Really good $50 headphones.

If I had just bought these without reading reviews, I would have really liked them. But having read almost unanimous glowing reviews, my expectations were a little higher... and were disappointed. So the details:

Style: Apparently this detail matters to people. I think they look cool enough, but I don't really trust my fashion sense, so whatever.

Durability: It hasn't broken in the week since amazon delivered it. Its construction seems strong enough that I'm not afraid something will break if I sneeze too hard. Will update if I have worse results as time goes on.

Sound Quality: I'd score it 8/10, or, ""pretty good."" I wasn't really looking for more than that, so I'm happy, though reviews lead me to expect better. It seems like they put a lot of effort [succesfully] in having an effective base, and clear trebles. The weakness is with the mids, which sound a bit muddy and indistinct to a picky ear.

Comfort: This is my main complaint with these headphones. I was particularly looking for headphones designed/reviewed for comfort, because I've experienced the frustration of constant ear-ache 30 minutes into whatever you're listening to. Description/reviews glowed for the comfort of this product.

Well... I got them, and 30 minutes in... ear-ache. They're actually worse than my previous, lower quality earphones. It's improved some since I first got them, as usage has stretched them a little wider so they don't press so tight against my head. But I thought I was buying ""comfortable"" and I got, ""Not as bad as it was at first."" In the future, I'll probably limit myself to ""Over the Ear"" instead of ""On the Ear.""

For anyone interested in the level of noise isolation: I can still hear my baby crying [though muffled], but my wife has repeatedly walked up behind me and scared the crap out of me. So yeah. Take that how you will.",Really good $20 headphones

In the meantime, I used an old Skullcandy set to do my transcribing, which I thought were decent and got the job done. But when these arrived, I put them to use immediately and I just LOVE them. I honestly don't think I would have appreciated the sound as much as I do had I not literally JUST taken the Skullcandy headphones off and put these on. It was really night and day. The sound to me is crisp. They're not noise cancelling, but I wasn't expecting them to be. But the biggest difference was that you could hear a huge reduction in excess noise in comparison to the SC I had on. Awesome headphones. I hope they have more colors because I will def buy another. If you've read any of my other reviews you probably know that I'm really big on presentation. These are definitely giftable. The box is matte black with metallic logo. It's very nice that I didn't I actually forgot that I bought headphones and was wondering what I could have bought that looks this expensive.",Affordable and great great quality headsets

For $20 these are a steal; these would be a steal for $40 in my opinion. The sound is very clear at almost all levels. There is a little static as you get up there, but the sound is so loud that you won't have worry about it being unclear.
The headphones themselves are very comfortable and adjustable, so the one size will fit all. Each side has a good amount of cushion to the point where they are not too bulky, but is still low key. The headphones also have the added bonus of folding for better storage in a backpack.
The cord is braided so the cord will hold together go a good while, but there is one thing that I do not care for. I wish the cord would unplug from the headphones, that way I could roll it up to store is better. But other than that these headphones are great for music, and dialogue.",An excellent pair of headphones

They have a nice length cord and are easy to use with any device. I like that they go to a decent volume and block out most of your other background noise. I had them on 25% with my computer/phone and couldn't hear my kids very easily who were watching TV in the same room. They are nice, sturdy, and heavy duty and I love that they fold down when not in use.

The color is a nice red and black. I think these these headphones are comparable to others and I like them just as much as the expensive pair of Ludicris Soul headphones I own or any Beat products. All together I would recommend these headphones to others because I think they are a pretty decent set of headphones for the price - especially if your kids ruin them fast as mine tend to do.",Good Pair of Headphones for the Price

She keeps losing them or loaning them to her friends which is frustrating. She is super critical of her headphones which I always find a little humorous since she has a hard time keeping track of them. I keep looking for “the one” that she will like and decide to keep track of.

These looked very stylish and simplistic making them a perfect choice. The sound is pretty amazing too considering the price making them an excellent choice everyday use and teens. These are corded which my daughter loves because she isn’t a huge fan of Bluetooth. She wants something she can plug-in and expect to work right away. These are comfortable and have nice padding on the ears without being too tight.

Overall, these have exceeded my expectations. I was provided these headphones free of charge for testing purposes.",Affordable headphones

I received a pair as a gift and they do sound good. The ear coverings are soft and comfortable, they have a nice fit, and an attractive look. There is no volume control, which is not a problem because, they can be controlled with the device volume. They are equipped with a microphone for making phone calls. Even the packaging reeks of professionalism, they come packaged in a nice black box with a formed bubble insert to cradle them in place. They also have a 6 month warranty, almost unheard of now days. The black and red design makes for a nice, modern look with a classic feel that I feel comfortable with. Overall, a nice pair of headphones that I would expect to be priced much higher.

PROS: The headphones fold up nicely, and the cord is fabric-covered and tangle-resistant. The headphones have very little creaking when adjusted on your head. There's a fair amount of bass. The tension against the ears is comfortable.

CONS: Muddy sound. My wife and kids all tried the headphones too, and agreed the sound was pretty bad. The top strap of the headphones is poorly padded and gets uncomfortable quickly.

VERDICT: These headphones will make your favorite music sound terrible. Maybe okay for watching movies or TV on a laptop.",Not good
1,Was this review helpful to you?, March 8 2017,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first impression when taking the headphones out of the box was that the quality seemed cheaper than I had anticipated. The original price for these was around $50, and I only paid $13 during a lightening deal. Given their original price, I expected them to be a great pair of headphones. All in all, I wouldn't recommend paying anything more than $20 for them.
Most importantly, the sound quality of these are pretty good (I'd give it a 4.6/5). It's nothing mindblowing, but around the same sound quality as a regular pair of skull candy earbuds. The sound quality doesn't disappoint, and is not a weakness in these headphones.
The quality of the plastic seems on the cheaper end (I'd give it a 3.5/5). Don't get me wrong, it doesn't feel like it would fall apart easily, but for a pair of headphones originally $50, I thought it'd feel more solid and not as light (in a negative way). The quality of the plastic is what makes it seem more like a $20 pair of headphones.
The comfort aspect of these headphones are also a downfall (I'd give it a 3/5). At first, they're just fine, not uncomfortable at all. Nothing superb, just an average pair of headphones. However, after wearing them for an hour they start to hurt my ears from hugging them for so long. It's not exactly a subtle pain, either, it bothers me enough that I have to take off the headphones and switch to earbuds. I would say I have an average size head, too, if not on the smaller side. There's no way to adjust the width of the headphones, so you can't do anything about them being too tight. This really is a pet peeve of mine since the only reason I bought headphones in the first place was the avoid the discomfort of wearing earbuds for too long.
In conclusion, the sound quality is pretty good, but the real downfalls are the quality of the plastic and the lack of comfort after wearing them for too long. If you're considering paying more than $20 for these ($30 at most), I'd recommend looking at other products first.","Good sound quality, but underwhelming material quality and comfort"
2,Was this review helpful to you?, June 2 2017,AILIHEN I60 On Ear Headphones with Microphone for iPhone iPad Laptop...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered 2 of my sons a pair of these foldable headphones so that they would be able to watch movies while we are going places. When these headphones arrived I used them on the computer and I was so excited at the awesome sound quality that they provided. My oldest son has also been using them while gaming and they work perfectly for this also! They have crystal clear sound with no crackling background noise like other similarly priced headphones and the voice quality is just as clear. I am now waiting on a third pair for my youngest son and recommend these headphones by AILIHEN to anyone looking for a great pair of reasonably priced foldable headphones!,****AWESOME SOUND QUALITY****

I have had two pairs of these headphones break in the past three months and I am not happy. The first pair I thought was my fault, since I dropped them. But I had suspicions about them no longer working after accidentally being dropped once from hip-height. So I ordered a second pair given the decent price... and they came pre-broken! (With the ""speakers"" inside of the earmuffs having come unglued and fallen out-of-place, causing tinny, quiet and poor sound quality.) I tried to fix them myself having had enough of this nonsense and not wanting to have to wait days or weeks to return them, and they completely fell apart the second I opened them up and tried gluing the speakers back in place. And I wasn't being rough. I've fixed broken headphones before and never had them just fall apart like this. Absolute cheap garbage!

However there are some cons. I have had these headphones for about 6 months now but sadly, only one side of the headphones work. I mainly use them to listen to music as I'm on my way to my university and as I am walking on my way to and from class. Only one side working is probably due to their everyday use and the fact that I put them in my backpack often so the chord became messed up. I recommend these headphones for at home or for low energy activities where the chord is not stressed.
