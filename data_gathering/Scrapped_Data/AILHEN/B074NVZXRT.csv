Was this review helpful to you?, September 18 2017,"Kids Headphones, HD30 Volume Limiting Children Headset with Microphone...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Your search for affordable quality kids headphones is over. These have excellent sound quality and are very well made. The ear pads are extremely soft so they sit comfortably on your child's ears. The colors are bright and fun. There's sure to be one that complements his or her personality. It's important to have your children use headphones specifically made for kids versus regular ones because they limit the volume. This prevents your child from using high decibels which can cause hearing damage. The children featured in the photos are ten and seven. These headphones are perfect for watching movies, listening to music, and video calling friends and family.",These have excellent sound quality and are very well made

Was this review helpful to you?, August 27 2017,"Kids Headphones, HD30 Volume Limiting Children Headset with Microphone...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for my son for his laptop as well as for the iPad when were are on car trips. The headphones have attractive fun colors, are well-made and made mainly of plastic. It is adjustable to fit the head size and also foldable for ease of transport. I like that the audio cables are detachable from the headphones as when the kids tug too hard, it just pops out and can be put back versus those that just get ripped out. This way even if the cable stops working, I can always find a replacement for it and the headphone can still be used. This headphones come with two audio cables - one which has the mic and one button for controlling pause/play, previous/next, answer/hang up call, and the other just a regular audio cable. The sound is quite clear, and the volume is not too loud so that it doesn't hurt his ears.",Cute safe volume headphones for kids
2,2,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, February 23 2018,"Kids Headphones, HD30 Volume Limiting Children Headset with Microphone...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that I bought similar headphones (Intone Ms200 Stereo Low Bass Folding and Adjustable Headphone Earbuds - White / Green) from the same seller (MUJI SHOP) a year and a half ago, and while the looks and sturdiness have been good, the sound quality was appallingly bad right off the bat. I gave it 3 stars as a compromise.

The HD30 here are similar, though with some improvements. The cord is now detachable, and there is an extra cord in the box. They're also volume-limiting, though it actually turned out to be a negative.

The gist is that for $17 and in 2018, the HD30 sound just as bad, if not worse, than the Intone Ms200 from a year and a half ago, except now the volume doesn't even go up as high. This means that my kid wouldn't even be able to hear what his cartoon characters are saying in anything but almost complete silence. Sound quality would be possibly OK for him at his age (5 years old), but I can tell just how awful it is.

And here's the nail in the coffin - I also ordered a pair of comparable Noot K11 headphones Kids Headphones - noot products K11 Foldable Stereo Tangle-Free 3.5mm Jack Wired Cord On-Ear Headset for Children (Navy/Teal) for less than $10, and they sound an order of magnitude better (and are louder). I am returning the HD30 and getting another Noot K11 in a different color instead. One thing they don't have is a replaceable cord, but at <$10, who cares? I'll just buy another when they break.

If the HD30 sounded better (way better), the star rating of this review would have been completely different. I'm docking 3 stars for audio quality and leaving 2 for the rest of the package being not totally awful.

The cushions are soft the the ears aren't red after an hour or 2 of use. Compare these to the regular headphones, the volume aren't as loud, but pleasant to their ears. Especially nowadays kids are clue to the phone or tables. The parents love it, and they can tell the difference, when they use this or the beats. For sure when the beats are in used. they will not answer to the parents call, but with this one, they will.

If you don't want overly loud music being played on your little ones eardrum this product is recommended. Not for a long period of time of an hour should be good.",The color of this headphone really pops and very easy to find when it's misplaced

First of all, they are loud enough to actually hear but the volume is limited a good amount to protect my toddler's ears. Second of all, it came with 2 headphone cables which is a very nice surprise since my toddler destroys the cables about once a month but I still need my kids to wear headphones so I can have peace and quiet in the house. Third, I like that the headphones fold up so it takes up less space in my bag.",Love them!

I cannot thank the makers enough for limiting the volume so these cannot be turned up too loud! I am constantly telling the little ones that they are going to ruin their hearing, but they don't understand the depth of that statement.

It has volume limiting, but they still seem to find a way to have it loud enough to block me out when I'm speaking... Not sure that's the headphones' fault, though.They seem pretty sturdily built while still being collapsible for packing away easily. By far, my favorite thing about these are the detachable cables (yes, plural) that come with it. Both are sturdy braided cables too.

For it to die so suddenly, the product is awful. I am extremely disappointed. I hope that there is a warranty on this headset or if I can get a replacement. The head set was hardly used for it to even die like that. If anything, the headset was maybe used a dozen times by a 6 year old with the help of parents.
