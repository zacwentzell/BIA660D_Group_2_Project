What should one expect for headphones costing under six dollars? If your expectations are realistic, you will be pleasantly surprised with these. I was looking for a quick easy fix, and found it in these namebrand phones with prime shipping to my door in two days. I've used them for about a week. They are in fact very lightweight and comfortable. They fit firmly atop my ears (firmly enough not to slide or shake off requiring readjustment during normal use) and do not create any pressure points on the cartilage of my ear (3 to 5 hours average time per use). As to their sound quality (remember, six bucks) I'm quite pleased. I find the biggest difference is the source material, as much of what I'm listening to his web based – streaming music, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon prime video/music – and quality audio varies from clip to clip, let alone source. At six dollars, there was virtually no competition. Bargain bin, no name, knockoff earphones from Walmart, CVS, T.J. Maxx (and the like) economy electronics' section are more expensive and hardly as reliable as Panasonic. Will I be lost in the experience as a blissful audiophile? NO WAY! Will I be able to hear what I'm listening to? No doubt! ... And that's the point","I was looking for a quick easy fix, and found it in these namebrand phones ..."

They cannot be beat as the ""bang for your buck"" champion. The sound is amazing with great bottom end. I was shocked the first time I listened to them and could hear so much more in the music. And the best part is the comfort of these headphones. I wear them for hours at my desk and never have any pain in my head, ears, or neck. They just sit there. You notice the great sound but never notice the feel of the headphones.

I take one to work, keep one upstairs, one downstairs, one in my travel bag, etc. They are great because they work adequately and they are fairly durable, but they cost so little. Eventually the form will wear away, the plastic piece that helps hold them to size will break away, and they'll just become more and more beat up. But they last long enough that they are totally worth it. Each pair seems to last me a couple of years with daily use. They are perfect for more risky situations where you may have concern your equipment could get banged up or lost, or kids might get a hold of them. If they get smashed, who cares. Buy another. I bought like 4 or 5 of these. Totally worth it for situations where you don't want to take your expensive headphones.

Sound quality is acceptable. If you're an audiophile, then you won't be satisfied with the quality. I use them for video streaming, video games, listening to music, etc and it always seems ok to me. They don't drown out external noise much though, so if you're in a noisy environment, it's not going to work out well.","Great value, perfect for more risky situations"

Was this review helpful to you?, December 12 2016,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first pair of these for full price of $5.95 in December of 2013 and have never accepted discounted products. My rating criteria is as follows. If the product works as is advertised and the quality is in line with the price then I give it five stars tentatively, then deduct stars for usability problems, functionality problems, flaws, quality, etc.

I've actually bought many pairs of these headphones for myself and others, and all have been of very high initial quality, and of good durability, with the price ranging up to $12 and back down to around $7.

Its hard to evaluate sound quality, and I have never had the desire or cash to spend more than $25 on headphones. But for the price I have been very happy--I've never said to myself, ""I wish these were louder,"" or ""I wish these sounded different,"" or anything else like that. I guess my thought is that if you know enough to critically evaluate a pair of headphones beyond those two questions, you probably wouldn't buy them on the Internet where you can't listen first. I've bought a couple other pairs of sub-$10 headphones for my wife and kids, and these are the loudest, best and longest lasting, but they insist on earbud style so they haven't switched to these full time.

I don't like in-ear headphones because they tend to fall out of me ears, and eventually just get uncomfortable after an hour or so. I guess I have a sensitive head, because I have quit using other headphones before because they squeeze too hard or the foam doesn't do its job. These are comfortable enough for me that I can watch a movie on an airplane without discomfort.

For a decent pair of headphones, you won't go wrong here. There may be better choices, but after listening to a couple other pairs that my family uses, if I needed a new pair of headphones I wouldn't even look at anything else.

As for durability, these have been very good for me. I'm not a person who uses headphones multiple times per day, so I can't comment on how durable they are with constant, heavy use.","Great choice for most users, inexpensive, loud, comfortable"

Was this review helpful to you?, March 15 2016,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oddly, some of the best headphones I've ever experienced and at an extremely affordable price. I don't know why, but most headphones, usually cause me to get headaches, or the make my ears hurt from the constant pressure, so I've steered away from headphones and have mostly opted for earbuds the past couple of years. I needed a new listening device and decided I might as well get some earphones and seeing that these were pretty cheap I decided to try it. I got TWO btw. Was going to give one to my little brother, but I'm keeping them both now xD lol

They are super comfortable. They don't give me headaches, or make my ears hurt at all. They're really flexible and comfortable over my head, I don't feel them at all when I'm using them to play something. In fact, I forget I have them on. I'm not saying they're the best ever, but for the price and from my experience, they're well worth it. They also work very well to block out some noise. It doesn't block everything out say like Beats, but they block out enough sound so that with your sound playing, you can't hear other things outside of your space.",GREAT Headphones for a great price.

I am very pleased with the quality. The bass is surprisingly good ! am always on the hunt for items that I can use by myself because I have several disabilities. I could not put them on without help, but this has nothing to do with the performance of the headset ! With this headset being so comfortable, I will have no discomfort if I fall asleep watching TV. I added my HonShoop .dongle, and turned the headset into a Blu-tooth headset ! The call and answering is very clear. Like others have said, you get a good product for a good price.

so satisfying. Not audiophile quality, but way better than your typical ear-buds.
Safer too, if you're out running a few miles. (don't play them too loud and you
will be able to hear people or cars approaching)

Was this review helpful to you?, April 4 2016,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones really pack a punch for the price! Its hard to find good on-ear headphones these days without looking you've got cans coming out of your ears. I wear hearing aids, and a lot of the time the cups on a lot of headphones, even more so with cheep headphones, make my hearing aids give feedback. With on-ear headphones this is not the case and I can mostly wear them on top of my hearing aids or pull them to in front of below my ears and still hear them. I can also hear conversations going on around me, and no one has to shout at me to get my attenion.
After reading a lot of the reviews of these headphones, I ordered them. They are lite, and the headband is nice and big. I can see them giving some trouble with someone with a smaller head, but for the most part this shouldn't have a problem. The padding is also nice. It doesn't feel scrachy to the hand, and more importently to the ears. You could easily wear these headphones for hours while doing some work on the computer, or while listenning to some audio around the house. The cord is nice and long so you could step away from a tablet or a computer or stuff the extra cord into your pocket along with your phone if you're moving around.
The sound for these headphones is great. You get a lot of the highs, a lot of the lows, and surprisingly a lot of bass. I'm no audiofile, but I couldn't be happier with these headphones. For such lite headphones the sound is great! If you're not expecting a great sound for 50+ headphones, these headphones I'd say sound anywhere from $10 to $30. If you know the limitiations of these headphones and don't expect them to sound like a $100+ pare of cans, you'll be surprised at how well these little guys sound.
I wouldn't use these at an office, unless its your home office though, on-ear headphones tend to leek a lot of sound. If you don't like or want to use earbuds, and don't want to look like you've got two cans on the sides of your head, these headphones fit the bill. This is one set of headphones I'll be buying again.",These lite headphones pack a punch for the money

Sure there are better headphones out there, but not at this price. I know, I have bought several sub $10 headphones over the years, these are the best in both sound quality and comfort.

If you are a heavy user of headphones and really want to enjoy quality sound sound and comfort, I would go for a more expensive set, but for a occasional user such as myself, these will make you happy.

Don't get me wrong, the bass and treble is quite good, but there are not going to match up with the sound of quality of headphones such as my old but still good over the ear Sony headphones. I guess what I'm trying to say is for $7.95, these are a diamond in the rough.

I will mention that on one of my old radios, if I push the plug in all the way, only one side works. I found if I pull the plug out slightly, both sides work.Not sure if this is the headphones plug problem, or the old radio.",I don't know how you can do better.

Ear buds, even more expensive earbuds, hurt my small ears. Larger on-ear and over-ear headphones are awkward, bulky, and can give me headaches.

I always end up returning to these. They're truly lightweight and fit nicely in my purse or backpack. They fit my iPhone and iPad (I'm sure Apple would have something to say about buying proprietary Apple headphones but I've never had a compatibility issue and they've never damaged any of my Apple equipment.) They fit our old portable DVD player. My daughter has also stolen them for her Innotab on occasion. I have even used them on my computer when I couldn't find my better headphones.

As others have noted, the sound quality is top notch for something so small and inexpensive. Bass is nice. Everything sounds rich, nothing sounds tinny. They don't fall off but they don't squeeze my skull to the point of headaches, and the adjustable headband is easy to move but remains solid wherever I adjust it.

2,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, June 28 2017,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great. They're indeed very light weight. They have a gentle fit so don't hurt your ears squeezing them against the sides of your head etc. They're a lot like the old time Sony Walkman style headphones that came with those little cassette players.

They're probably fairly durable, but I wear these for hours every single day. I buy 3 or so at a time and unbox the next one when I finish the one I'm wearing off. The quickest I've ever finished one off was around 3 weeks, but they usually last 4 months or so.

The bass is there, but not overpowering. It's just right, not too much mid, and not too much high. I'm blind so my computer is talking to me constantly when I'm using it. I'm also profoundly deaf, so wear behind the ear hearing aids. These fit well against the aids if I turn them around backward. The downside to that is the stereo field is reversed. The flat pads on these don't try to wrap around your ear or cancel out environmental sound. They are very gentle in terms of causing hearing aids to experience feedback. I can wear them for many hours without getting tired of having them on. They don't press the backs of my ear against the aid and produce sore spots and the like.

The cable is not overly thick, not ridiculously thin either - probably just about right for the price. The plug is an l shaped, sticks out of your device about 1 cm before the 90 degree turn, then the sleeve ends 7/8th of an inch. The wire splits about 14 inches from the earphones with a little plastic gizmo that does not slide up or down. It sends one wire to each earphone.

The earphones are on a slide thing that's in the headband, you can slide them out for a bigger head. I always keep them all the way slid in, that's the best fit for my hearing aids. All the way slid in, worn backward with the headband tilted way forward and nearly on my forehead. If it sounds weird it's because it is, but it works, and works for many hours every day.

If I want to complain, it would be that I kind of wish they had a straight plug, with a short jacket on it, and I wish they had an integrated decent quality microphone. I've driven myself crazy trying to find a headset that looks sort of like these do, has flat pads, sounds ok, will sit on my hearing aids, etc, etc, while having a microphone that, a: doesn't have a short and allow the person on the other end to hear my computer talking as though it's actually their computer talking, even though I'm freaking wearing headphones, and b: refuse to sound decent.

The most common failure point for these have been one or the other of the earphones will become quieter. Once or twice one will completely stop working and I can affect it by pushing the cord up into the bottom of that earphone, but usually it just grows quieter. This is most often after a few hundred hours of usage though, and I'm not disappointed. For the price, I honestly don't think these can be beat in terms of durability and sound quality. They're above average any way I slice it for sound quality. They won't hold up against Bowse and the like but they're quite impressive anyhow.","Highly recommend! Sound great! They won't last you for ever, but they do outlast other headphones of the price point."

The audio frequency response is balanced and can provide very rich base and clear distinct treble with thorough full mid-range. All harmonic overtones come through well balanced with no booming,

Though the cheap headband makes them initially uncomfortable, they are light and are tolerable for casual short time use in a home studio. Due to cheap design of the head band, the ear pads cannot independently swivel and may not sit properly flush on the ear.

I would only buy these if I needed to purchase a large number of inexpensive headphones where the sound quality and carrying convenience was unimportant.

If you care about the sound quality, comfort, and convenience I recommend paying an additional $10 and getting the Panasonic Over-the-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT227 ($16.99).

I have owned $150 pairs of headphones whose highs and lows were not as clear and rich as the sound I get from these headphones. That is not to say that these are amazing sounding, but they're quite good for the price.

I like that these headphones are lightweight and comfortable. As stated above, over time worn the headphones often become a bit loose and require adjustment, which is an issue I haven't had one other headphones.

My first pair lasted for a good couple of years. I replaced them recently with another which started to show signs of a defect after only a week of use.

The headphones themselves are comfortable and fit securely. The cord is why I rated this four and not five stars. One, it's short. It was clearly meant for portable devices only, as it reaches to my phone in my pocket with only a little slack to spare (I suppose I should have realized this before buying since it says right on the product description). Two, the plug does not fit securely into audio jacks. It's pretty easy to accidentally loosen to the point where it is still inside the jack but does not transmit audio. I bought this hoping to use it both for portable music and my desktop computer. I have only found it useful for the former.

UPDATE 27 DECEMBER 2016:

Okay. I've had this pair for a little while now. I still can't understand why the cord would be so short. I can barely use this thing. The only way I can use it without the jack repeatedly coming out of my phone is if it's in my shirt pocket, and I don't like to do that because my phone might fall out when I bend down. I definitely can't use it for my computer because my head would need to be too close. It's good for maybe watching a movie on your phone. I've changed my rating to 3 stars down from 4 because of this. It seems to be of good quality other than the cord, which is long enough for perhaps a child or infant.

UPDATE 17 JUNE 2017:

This pair's giving out. Right ear's coming in and out. Starting two months ago the plastic tabs holding each side to the frame started to break off, causing the adjustable parts to slide freely. Still not terrible headphones for the price. They've lasted 7 months.",Cord way too short

Well, when it was about time for the trip, I unpacked them both and tested them. These blew me away. The bass was amazing. And compared to the RCA headphones, it was no contest.

So I'm speaking as a person who just like to listen to music and knows very little about the high end stuff.

I did not want an expensive set of head phones, (they might ""walk away""), so this was a good buy. I figured I could go through 10 sets at $5 a set, and it would be worth it, even if each set didn't hold up very long - compared to having a $50 set for 1 week, then they disappear into thin air.

I've used the earbuds for awhile, (about 4 yrs) and they're OK, about $8 a set in the grocery store, sound quality decent, but they wear out after a few months (not surprising). My only real complaint with the earbuds was every time I fixed them comfortably in my ears, someone would come up to me for something, and I'd have to take them out and then spend 5 minutes trying to get them comfortable again!

So I looked around for headphones, thinking at least I could just pop them on and off.

VERY SURPRISED!!!!!!! and pleased at how 1) comfortable; 2) excellent fit (usually after 3 months the headpiece has stretched out on every pair, cheap or expensive, I have ever owned, and they're too loose; 3) truly great sound quality and 4) durable. I'm hard on everything. They're still working fine.

Both speakers are working perfectly. True stereo.

I have very good hearing - I can hear someone using a stapler 3 work areas away with no trouble - that's why I need the headphones.

The sound quality on these little gems is so good, I can actually hear the singer sometimes pause and inhale before starting another line. NEVER heard that with any headphones before.

I'm ordering 3 more sets for our home computers.

The sound is just unbelievably good and it's got nothing to do with the price. I'd bet that on blind tests these would hold their own with ones costing a hell of a lot more. How they manage to get decent bass from such a small headphone is just amazing.

I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics hurt after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.

The jack had to be moved around to get all kinds of levels of sound, and then it's either the voices disappeared and the music stayed or the background noise is all that was heard. I decided to return the headset and try a replacement (again, such good reviews, I must have received a defective one). Here comes the second set, and out of the box - the same identical problem. To get some level of sound I had to play around with the jack, pull it out slightly, turn it around, and then the sound would break at the first movement. I'm returning this one also and will never order again. Just for reference, I own a set of Inland headphones with microphone and sound adjustment, and the jack is identical. It works superbly on my laptop.",Didn't work out of the box. Twice.

I didn't realize that the sound quality would be so inferior. I'm not looking for super cool DJ headphones or anything, just headphones for work. I unplugged my current headphones with a shorter cord (that I was hoping to replace) and plugged these Panasonic ones in. I was SHOCKED at how much quieter the music was on these Panasonics compared to my current (similarly styled, over the ear) headphones. The Panasonic DO NOT have a good quality and feel of the plastic… feels cheap, easy to crack. I will be sticking with my shorter cord headphones that work wonderfully.

9,Was this review helpful to you?, April 17 2014,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that these are my favorite style of headphones. I find ear-buds to be uncomfortable, and the sound to be of poor quality (no bass whatsoever and low quality high notes). The big ear-muff style headphones sound great, but I don't like how they look on me, nor do I like the fact that you can't hear any other noises (like someone trying to get your attention). They are also not really as good for wearing while doing something physical, such as jogging, and they are too big to be able to have them on while your head is sideways on a pillow or a chair, etc.

But this style of headphones is a nice compromise right in the middle.

In my experience for a couple months of frequent use of these headphones, with all kinds of music and audio, I have found them to sound very decent. Compared to other brands and models of this style of headphones that I have owned, these have a very decent amount of bass in them, significantly more so than my last pair, and the high notes also sound nice and clear. They fit well on my head too. For what they are, they do a very decent job.","Inexpensive, decent sounding headphones"

I would think, if this is the standard size these headphones come in, they would definitely be too large for children to wear. I have to wear them at a funny angle to keep them on my ears, so I only use them when I am at home. Otherwise, they are relatively small in appearance, comfortable against the ears, unobtrusive, inexpensive, and -- if they fit properly -- quite suitable for wearing while out and about.

I can say from personal experience that these headphones sound better, last longer, and are more comfortable than models costing two or three times as much. And these other models were still BUDGET headphones (from Sony and Philips if you're curious). To say that these are the best value for your money is to not praise them enough. It's more like they are stuck on a permanent 75% price discount.

Panasonic, please make a version of these that has an elastic cord pull guard, and has maybe a more sporty/athlete look so that I can look cool jogging. Maybe a behind-the-neck style.

I wanted a cheap pair of headphones that were lightweight and fit comfortably. Here is my comparison:

1. Sound Quality: These Panasonic ones win. The bass is better and the sound is clearer.

2. Comfort: Koss won this one, by a small margin. They are both very comfortable, but the Koss ones were so comfortable, I could probably wear them for hours without needing to take them off.

For the incredibly low price, I feel like both these Panasonic ones and the Koss ones were worth buying.

UPDATE: About 5 months after I bought these, the sound started going out. The headphones now have that problem where the audio goes out in one side when you adjust the volume level. I can only set the volume at very loud or very quiet if I want both sides to work. Overall, I'm not surprised, given the price. I feel like I've gotten a good use out of them - but they're definitely not very durable.",These Panasonic Headphones Work Very Well

No, Mr Audiophile Guy, they're not Beats or Sennheiser or even Skull Candy headphones. We all get that, right? But I live in a townhouse, and prefer listening to music or watching movies on my computer with headphones, 'cos I'm a nice neighbor... who is also a night owl. No one wants to hear me watch the battle scene at the end of ""Master and Commander"" at 4AM, ya know? Anyway, I love these headphones for the quality of the sound (far too good for the price) and for extended listening at my desk. Unlike earbuds, these won't tire your ears after a few hours. It's easy to listen with just one headphone if you need to keep an ear open for the doorbell or a kitchen timer. No, these phones can't possibly compete with $50 (or more) headphones... but they're an exceptional value for the price, and they're surprisingly durable, too. I've owned two pairs in my life; the first lasted about 8 years of daily abuse (I took them everywhere back then). This pair should last even longer, since they never leave my computer desk.",Maybe my all-time favorite headphones!

I'm currently listening to ""The YES Album"" (still a favorite...you 'old' prog lovers know what I mean!) Their music has quite a range of sounds...and I'm hearing them all nicely...from grinding bass to delicate acoustic guitar...not to mention Jon's incredible voice.

I was not disappointed at all. The sound is really very good for such a small inexpensive set of headphones. I work in front of a set of studio monitors that are very accurate and often find myself taking the headphones off to check that the speakers aren't on and annoying my coworkers because I can hardly tell the difference in the sound of the speakers vs the headphones. The only minor complaint is that they are a little uncomfortable (for me) to wear because of the smallish size of the earpads and the fact that they don't sit flat against your ear, they angle in a little too much toward the front so they slightly pinch my ears, but it's not terrible.

They are comfortable and durable. I am using them in my Sangean DT-120 radio. The cord is about 4 feet long so you can put the radio in your pocket and still havde plenty of length remaining. The headphones are adjustable to fit various head sizes. I have worn them over a hat. The main disappointment is the sound level. The stereo quality is adequate, but I have to turn up the volume on my radio to almost full to get a suitable listening level when outside to compensate for outside noise (traffic etc.). By comparison, my Sony earbuds give the same sound volume at 1/4 of the sound level on my radio. These headphone have a high impedence level (24 ohms). Could this be the cause? I'm not an electronics expert, but I have not seen this high of an impedence on other headphones.

They are

-Cheap as hell
-Comfortable
-Sound decent
-Cord is long
-has a tiny bit of bass
-better than earbuds

If you really enjoy music I recommend you step up to maybe the 30 dollar price range and get some sennheisers.

But if you are a casual listener, these are perfect.",For the money it's great.

While these are not HD 202 quality headphones, and certainly not as powerful, they are pretty darn good for $5. The main problem with these headphones is that they don't get very loud, and they get distorted at high volumes. This isn't a problem for regular home listening, but they don't work well on airplanes. However, they beat the Sennheisers in comfort by a mile. You can wear these forever without any problems. They barely put any pressure on your ears and work great with glasses. I've fallen asleep with them on twice. They seem to be pretty durable too. You could probably snap them easily if you tried, but you can throw them in your backpack and they'll be fine. Overall, these are probably the best headphones you can get for around $5, and I would recommend them to anybody.",Perfect for their price

In my opinion, you will not find a set of open headphones with the caliber of tight, punchy, rich and rewarding sound as these.
Worth every penny and then some imho as a classical guitarist, musician and headphone aficionado.

PROS:

1. Price is a clear market-buster-I paid $4.56
2. Extremely lightweight (1.7 ozs) and uber comfortable-does not pinch or bind.
3. Unsurpassed base response at 16 Hz-Clearly ""Best in Class"" (Sensitivity rated at 100 dB/mW)
4. Excellent for listening to just about any genre-infuses richness to the listening experience.
5. Large 30mm diaphragms with neodymium magnets.

CONS:

1. Mediocre treble response (tinny, shallow, superficial highs but within expected frequency response parameters considering the exceptional price point.
2. Plastic un-reinforced headband does not retain its original flexibility after extended use and may become somewhat distended.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Purchase several pairs of these. At this price, you can afford to have several around the house, work, auto, studio!!
2. I still love my old metal RS PRO-35 Titanium Phones the best but these blow anything away at this price.The Richness of","""Head"" for These Phones !!!!! The Richness of Sennheiser for the Price of Coby !!"

I have purchased inexpensive headphones in the past and been satisfied. However, these headphones were very disappointing. They didn't work well, the jack wiggled in the hole and caused a lot of noise. Even when it was not moving in the hole, the sound quality was poor, the volume considerably lower than usual. Even turning up the volume did not help increase the sound. These are really not worth purchasing.

Was this review helpful to you?, February 14 2013,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say that these are pretty good for the money. They are NOT as good as the Sennheiser 100's they are replacing, but for a cost that is 10% of those, these are just fine for the gym. They are perfectly acceptable for working out, but a few things I noticed are as folows:
1. Not as loud as Senneheiser - these just barely get loud enough on quiet songs for my iPod Nano
2. Not as comfortable - these are not uncomfortable (everyones head is different - right?), but feel a little harder on the ears and the head band is scratchy when you put around your neck.
3. These are brighter (less warmth and bass response) , but sound is pretty accurate overall and tweaking the EQ helps some.

Overall, these are a great deal for active people who need a cheap set of headphones. I would not give it 4 stars if it was more expensive, but value is part of the equation here. I still have my nice headphones for use at home, but I spent less than $5 on these, so very happy overall!",Pretty good sound - Great price!

Earbuds hurt my ears, so I wanted a ""headband"" style pair that sat on the outside of my ears. I chose the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port because of the price (<$5) and because there were so many great reviews. Normally, I shy away from super cheap deals because you usually get what you pay for (i.e., cheap deal = cheap product). Not so with these headphones. They are lightweight with a very decent sound, and are extremely comfortable. I had no problems wearing these on a 4 hour flight. My ears never hurt once, and I hardly noticed the headband. Plus, if I do every lose or break them, I won't be upset because of the price. But they seem very durable, and survived a round trip flight and being shoved in my backpack. They've already been used well more than $5 worth, so I feel like it's money well spent.

An impressive power handling is lost within 5 minutes because of the fatigue induced by that upper midrange which doesn't allow for more than background listening. This has been done by Panasonic in an attempt at 'clarity' , one backfire, and second backfire, rolling off treble at around 15KHz. These tweaks, as you know, are kiddy stuff when factory tuning drivers, and 30mm neodymium drivers are extremely amenable to such tweaks. How Panasonic could have screwed up so badly in this tweaking is beyond me. They could have reduced power handling from a silly unrealistic 1000 mW to 500mW, since for sake of reference portable headphone amps like the Electric Avenues pump out on average 200 mW , a hefty output would be 500; 1 watt is jaw-dropping stuff in headphone proportions; Burson make some of these, esoteric , expensive stuff, not likely to be matched with the HT-21 . Then, reduced impedance from a silly 24 ohm that little portable amps find hard to drive, and some reviewers here describe the resulting sound as ""tinny"", where compressed, stained might be more appropriate adjectives, to a sensible 16ohm. Background listening through headphones?? ... oh, why go on: in short, for the same price get the Panasonic bestseller earbuds, which have none of the above afflictions of these dull candidates, and are a pleasure to listen to.

These were cheaper (when I got them, free shipping but it had tax and it came to be $5.34) and my sister said headphones were better so I decided to risk it and try these. If they weren't good, I would have just wasted $5, which I don't think is much so I bought them. The first good thing about these headphones was the shipping. I got them in less then a week (I think like 5 or 6 days). I just opened them now and I am still listening to my music, which mostly contains rock, but I do have a little rap and other stuff. These work well with all of the genres of music I listen to. Another thing is they are way more comfortable than the in-ear ones. They also don't fall off easily. So for $10 or more you can get in-ear ones that will most likely blow out within a month like all the other one I have owned did, or for less than $10 for these great headphones.

Today the left speaker blew out. They were still worth it though because they did last a while for $5. I do have 2 complaints now though.

1. It's hard to explain, but these headphones kind of extend for people with bigger heads i guess and it clicks into place so it doesn't move once set. The things that keep them in place have worn out so if you pick up the headphones, they will extend.
2. After maybe an hour of having them on, they did start to hurt my ears a little. It's not that they are too tight or from the sound, but my ears just start to hurt.",Best headphones I have ever had - and for under $10!

I bought both to have a backup in case one stops working. In the last few years I've bought at least 6 which have all stopped working.

The Panasonic RP-HT21 and the Sony MDR-110LP are very similar. Both work well and both are about the same price. Also both can be easily adjusted for different head sizes ranging from a small child to an adult. Just gently pull the band on each side and it will expand.

For me both of these headsets work well. However, the sound on the Panasonic may be a bit better. It seems to be a bit clearer like my old headset which cost several dollars more. My old headset stopped working on one side after only a few months of use. Hopefully these will last longer.

For my purposes the Panasonic is perfect. I use it at my desktop daily to listen to mp3s, movies, youtube videos and all sounds on my computer (including an occasional popup advertisement). So far this seems to be the best headset you can find in this price range. However, if you're a music fanatic and must have more sound control perhaps you'll need to spend more on an expensive headset.

When this happens, I can only hear out of one ear unless I hold the cord juuuuuuust right. Anyway, I always end up having to replace my headphones at least a couple of times a year, no matter which brand or model I buy; so the cheaper I can get them, the better. These headphones actually work quite well; and they are inexpensive. The only drawback is that they wear out on me pretty quickly. Anyway, it's time for me to replace the ones I bought about six months ago; but I'm going to go with the same model once again, because they're so reasonably priced.

I tried one of the spares out with pandora and was actually surprised by how rich the sound is and how comfortable they are. If your not an audio file or a slave to fashion then I would highly recommend these. The cord is adequately long but they fit loose on my head so I would not recommend running with them. But sitting at your desk listening to toons they are not a bad option at a marvelous price.

I really like that the ears are not ginormous-it's REALLY hard to find these kinds of headphones (where it goes over the top of your head-as opposed to the little things you stick in your ears) that are small enough for my head/ears-so that's why I keep coming back to these ones.

6,Was this review helpful to you?, March 14 2017,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these on the recommendation of a reviewer who purchased an MP3 player I had bought. Also, I was influenced by many of the reviews posted here.

Because I listen to a lot of classical music, I tried these phones with tracks from classical works. I found that the bass response was very good but the treble range was too shrill to be entirely satisfactory.

In Paganini's Capriccio No. 24 played on a guitar, the strings came across but the sound of the fingering that accompanies the music with better headphones was largely missing. Suppe's Light Cavalry Overture sounded bright, especially the brass, but the piece was missing some of the midrange instrumentation.

Vocals came across effectively, though voices were missing some of the resonance one expects to hear. The earphones simply could not handle the canons firing in the 1812 Festival Overture. The Montagues and Capulets from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet had good bass and fair if partly shrill treble in the violins.

On the other hand, the Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks from Pictures at an Exhibition did justice to Ravel's delightful orchestration. So, surprisingly, did Saraste's Carmen Fantasy, in which the solo violin for once didn't seem too shrill at all. The piano and solo trumpet in the Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 1 were fine although the orchestra lacked body, perhaps because the midrange was a bit muffled.

All the above tracks were tested with much more expensive headphones, so it wasn't the recordings that were responsible for the compromises in sound. Considering the price of these phones they performed well enough but not for critical listening.

1,Was this review helpful to you?, December 7 2013,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased three of these for my children for a recent vacation (flight). My kids are not very good about being able to keep ear-bud style headphone on, so I thought it might be better to have some on-the-ear style headphones. The headphones were a bit large for smaller heads, but they were able to sit back on the airplane seats and let the headphones rest on the seat. When they wanted to lean forward, the headphones would balance backwards and stay in position.

In general these worked great - reasonable loudness and clarity (for the price), lightweight, durable, and great price. Even the three year old liked them and that made the flight easier. I would note that they do not fold, but since I am giving these to the kids to use, they are more likely to break than get lost so I prefer more durability (non-folding). I would definitely buy them again if the need arises.","Good Quality, Lightweight, Low Price - Great Choice For Kids"
2,Was this review helpful to you?, August 11 2015,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparison of 4 Amazon Stereo Headphones:
I grew up using partial over the ear but this style is difficult to find these days. I use the headphones when exercising, during yard work, or fix-up projects around the house. I wear an extra large male hat size.
My favorite is the Maxell SL-3, hp-200. I like the way they feel as they are the most comfortable of the group. The sound is well balanced throughout the frequency range. The over the ear component aligns with the middle of each earpiece so the angle feels good. One potential drawback is that the cord is a straight plug connector as opposed to the firm rubber right angle plugs that are more common. I remember having many of these straight connectors that eventually went bad at the connection.

My second favorite is the Sonxtronic XDR-8000. These have ends that go into the ear. They are comfortable. These are lacking in the base and low frequency range and require a higher volume setting to achieve the same sound as the padded Maxell and Panasonic headphones reviewed. The sound is a bit “tinny”. I am keeping these because while they don’t sound the best, they don’t have the foam pads and thus will hold up much better for those times when I am sweating heavily.

My third favorite is the Panasonic RP=HT21. These headphones have the overall best sound and have a very full stereophonic sound. They have the best bass and low frequency sound. They have a very good 90 degree connector plug. The cord is a great length. The problem is that they are narrow and sized for a person with a smaller, narrower head than mine. Furthermore, the over the head portion attaches to the earpiece at its front section. This design causes the earpiece to flare away from the back of the ear and the sound suffers. If you hold the earpieces to your ears with your hands the sound improves significantly. In addition, this design results in a pinching effect that is very uncomfortable. If the headpiece connected to the mid point of the earpiece I believe the problems would be solved and this would jump to the #1 favorite position. At the price I am willing to keep them and see if they become more comfortable with time, but I am very doubtful.

Totally unacceptable is the Sony MDR-A17G. Although they say Sony on the item, I doubt they are really made by Sony. The earpiece quality is terrible and had extra plastic that scratches the ear. The overall quality looks very cheap. The sound is terrible, with a very tinny sound and no bass. These will be returned.",Comparison of 4 Amazon Stereo Headphones

I have used a lot of lightweight headphones like these over the years and I think this is the best of the bunch. The wire they use is a bit thicker than most and the headphones just seem a little more sturdy overall. They sound good and feel good.

WORK:
I plug my headphones into a 2 foot extender which plugs into the headphone jack of the computer. I've noticed no loss of sound quality.

The very first time I put these on and watched a demo video, I was shocked at the ""surround sound feel"", so much so, I looked around, thinking someone else was playing a video. The sound is VERY clear, you can hear all instrumentation in the background. On my old cheapy headphones, I had to have the volume at least 10-12 bars high to hear, with these, 3-4 bars will do perfectly. This shows the large range of volume these have.

I was pleasantly surprised that the ear ""piece"" actually swivels in and out for a better fit to your head. It took a week to get used to the large, flat cushioned ear piece (it kind of smashed my ear), but I barely notice now.

CON:
I thought the wide head band would fit better on my head, but for some reason, even sitting still at a desk, these still slide backwards on the smallest setting. The surface is extremely smooth, no grip, which is probably the reason. It's the only annoyance I have with these.

JOGGING/EXERCISING:
I had some slippage as well while jogging, but again, will have to play with the adjustments. Note: The ear cushions are large and if you sweat a bit, this will make it a bit uncomfortable as they will get wet. (However, it's better then ear buds constantly falling out of your ears)

All in all, these are PERFECT for the price of a basic user. I'm VERY happy with my purchase.",Pleasantly suprised!!

(wish I could have told you which model but it has worn of)
After listening to these on my laptop for a couple of hours I have to say that out of the box, the mid to high frequencies are boosted way too much for my liking (vocals and percussion stand out and overpower the bass). I have used the equalizer in winamp to reduce the harshness of the frequencies a bit and it sounds better.
That being said audio source has a big part to play, so i can't say how these will sound on a portable audio device with limited equalizer abilities.
Other things to note are that its kinda small(30mm driver), its very light, and cables are kinda thin.

Bottom line for 5 bucks....you would be hard pressed to find better

9,3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, March 13 2011,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, I said it. These sound an awful lot like the Koss PortaPro, for about a sixth of the price (and the PortaPro is cheap as it is!). I've A-B'ed them, and the bass is *almost* on par. Seriously. The big difference in sound signature lies in the mids. I think these have more pronounced mids. They seem a smidge more fatiguing to listen to in general, but nowhere near enough to be concerned.

Fit might be objectionable for some--they're super-light, but the drivers are actually tilted *backward* slightly, such that the clamping force of the phones presses only against the area in *front* of your ear--not really *on* the ear itself. The drivers definitely rest over your ear, but the ""on-ear"" pressure is negligible. The only pressure at all is closer to your temples. Personally, I love this design, because it shifts any pressure to a nice, flat bony area (at least on my head), rather than into my ear cartilage. But I could see some finding the fit to be strange.

So no, they don't fold flat like the Coby CV185, or clip into a cool ball like a PortaPro, and no, they're not quite as comfortable as a KTX1Pro, but then, what is? (I have a very tall head, and I think the KTX1s are just about the most comfortable set of cans under $100, but that's just me.) These cans' back-to-basics design is outright refreshing. So, of the three (the Coby, the PortaPro, and the KTX1Pro), I have to give these the nod for street wear.

Oh, and did ya notice that they're RIDICULOUSLY cheap? For the price of a swanky cup of coffee, there's not much to lose. If you really have money to burn, try the RP-HT46(?), which is the same as these, only there's a volume control (I think), and they FOLD! But if you're just skatin' on the seriously cheap, yeah, these are them.",A (really) poor man's PortaPro

Even with the iPod's equalizer turned off, the sound was clear and pleasing. So far, this pair of headphones beats my other headphones in sound quality.

The headphones sit lightly on your ears. This was a big A+ for me, as my previous headphones made my ears hurt after a couple hours. Haven't tested these long-term yet, but it looks promising. They're very comfortable as well. The headband's the perfect length for me, and the cord is surprisingly long. Extremely lightweight and slim, too. Perfect for a backpack or purse. One thing to note: They don't feel very durable. They feel like the cheapos that come with CD/DVD players. This was expected, considering how cheap they were, and I do think they'll last a while.
Edit: They did. They lasted three whole years with regular use. Then the plug got bent somehow, and the audio started cutting in and out. I assumed some wiring had snapped, so I threw them away and bought another pair, brand new, straight from Amazon. They were half-functional. The left earphone worked properly...but the right one was barely audible at the same volume. I reported them as defective through the Returns Center and asked for a replacement. Amazon sent that (brand new) replacement over with one-day shipping. But the replacement headphones were only slightly better, and now, a week later, the right earphone in those is dead too. Rating lowered from 5 to 1 star. It's very sad that these headphones have become such junk- not one, but TWO, BRAND-NEW pairs straight from Amazon had the EXACT SAME defect. I'll be looking elsewhere.",Perfect...until I needed a replacement.

However, the biggest issue (and the reason I plan on returning it) is the fact that I cannot plug it into my Samsung Galaxy Pro 8.4 with a hybrid / hard case. The plug molding is too big (and the right angle probably doesn't help either) and cannot plug all the way into the socket with the hybrid case. I have 2 different hybrid / hard cases, and this does not work with either of them.

This *may* work for some / soft cases, but to be safe, I would rather buy a pair of headphones with a slimmer (and straight) headphone plug.",Warning!!! May not work if you have a hard / hybrid case on your phone or tablet

When you see awesome reviews of a $5 product, you have to wonder, ""Is this product truly awesome or is it just awesome for a $5 product?""

Well, in my opinion, this product is truly awesome, made awesomer by its price. I don't think I've ever had headphones of this quality before. I think the sound quality is even better than that of my 2.1 speaker set, subwoofer and all (though granted, it was a fairly cheap set itself, but still sounded great!). I've never had very expensive headphones, but these are even cheaper than all of the ones I've owned previously and yet these own all of them, hands down.

My only lament is that these aren't in-ear earbuds or at least noise-isolating in some way, but that's just not what this product is. That'd be like complaining that a really tasty chocolate ice cream isn't vanilla; I ordered chocolate knowing and expecting it to be chocolate, and even if I prefer vanilla and wish that that amazing ice cream came in that flavor, that shouldn't change my review of that chocolate ice cream.

9,11 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 7 2011,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've recently received my Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones, and I've gotta say, I'm impressed! Cheap headphones have come a long way, but these really do take the cake. I've had dozens of headphones in my life, and working in the video production field, I've used some really pricey ones (don't get me wrong, there's a big difference between this type of headphone and high-quality monitor headphones).

These are the perfect music/leisure headphones. They have great sound, but the surprising part is how much bass these things put out! It's like having a sub right next to your ear! However, I will point out, these things do put out a little too much bass to be accurate right off the bat, but an EQ can fix that if you prefer a more ""harmonious"" sound; if you like your bass, then you won't have to do a thing. The overall sound output is pretty decent: lows, mids, highs, they're all there. Now, these are cheap so accuracy is a different story (these are slightly muddy compared to more expensive headphones), but like I said, these are leisure headphones, which work excellent for listening to rock/pop/rap, etc. Unless you plan on dishing out $40+, you won't find anything better, and those still might not be great for music listening, since you kinda want that accentuated bass/booming tone for most music (or at least I do).

So, these are cheap headphones, don't expect them to last forever, but if taken care of, there's nothing mechanically flawed in the pair. This is the old-school defacto design, and it kinda makes me laugh to see we've moved away from this design for buds (which, at least they have improved, but still don't compare). Since these aren't buds or noise canceling, others will be able to hear your music at higher volumes, but it really isn't that bad, since these have ""ports"" I figured it might be louder externally than it actually is.

I believe another reviewer pointed this out already, but the title is misleading, the port is merely referring to a literal ""port"" or hole, so that bass can be amplified in the compact design; there aren't like extra plugs or anything wacky on these headphones, just the normal 3.5mm headphones jack. The packaging doesn't even have any mention of the port, which I'm assuming they removed due to confusion; I only knew what XBS was because they used to have it slapped on their products. Also, the cord is 4.5ft in case you wanted to know, I couldn't find that anywhere on Amazon, had to go to another site to find that out; that length is perfect for me, since they are plugged into the front audio jack on a PC sitting on the floor. My previous iPod buds were 3ft and I had to tilt my head to use them.

So, all in all, you should buy these. I'm glad I bought them, may buy half a dozen more to be honest, I really enjoy these little headphones!",These things ROCK!!!

I don't quite understand how they are priced so low and actually work this well. I don't find any particular range being overshadowed by another and I am still pleasantly surprised by the range and depth of the music coming through them.

I primarily use these while listening to Pandora on my phone so the cable length is not an issue. However, when I plug it directly into my computer, which only sits behind the monitors, the length seems a bit short so keep this in mind.",Excellent headphones for the money

The audio quality is inferior when compared with apple's earphones, but for the price at 3.99 and free shipping they are unbeatable and do give excellent audio for the price range.

They like the fit and feel of the headsets on their smaller heads vs. the plug style headphones. One of the two has broken already after about 90 days. The issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which, when pulled out from the netbook or DVD player, it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connection.

I ordered a replacement because the kids like them. The kids like them and the price is right. I have tried to get them to be more careful with the plugs, but I don't think it is their hands pulling on them as much as the design.

price: for $4.50 including S+H, you can't get better headphone than this. this is really a $15-$25 headphone.
good audio quality. (see ""good for"" below)

dislikes:
headphone is a little uncomfortable to wear due to the rough edges on the crown. OEM could smooth out the rough edges.
need to increase audio volume to compensate headphone's lower than average volume output.

good for:
regular home TV, talk show, audio book, news programming.

high quality music appreciation (e.g. classical, acoustic, jazz).
outdoor activities (uncomfortable to wear during workout)

conclusion:
i could buy another pair given the high quality to price ratio.","for $4.50, you can't get a better headphone than this but uncomfortable to wear."

I was only a few cents short and I didn't want to have to spend another $3 to $5 in shipping, so I began to look around for little things that I would have considered nice to have just so that I could get another item for that money. I was very lucky to stumble upon these headphones as they have quickly become my favorite item from that group purchase. What I thought would have been just a nice, keep to the side just in case item, have become my favorite headset to use on the computer and I use them everyday.

These Panasonics were incredibly cheap when I purchased them (around that $3-5 range) but the quality and sound they have are incredible for that price point. I have not had a problem with discerning any kind of sound from videos, games, sound effects, etc. They are also very comfortable as the ear portions can slide very far to fit a variety of different head sizes. The cord is also a good length so that you have a decent amount of room to work with in leaning down from the computer jack or using with an iPod.

I have had no complaints using these headphones and, to be honest, am very surprised at just how good they are. You can't go wrong with these headphones and especially at the price, consider them a great bargain instead of cheap knock offs.",Simple Headphones With Great Sound and Price

I have been through 4 different Kindles HDX which have been replaced over and over again by Amazon but the same problem still exists. The headphone jack on the Kindle HDX was apparently an afterthought and does no function properly. This is certainly not the problem of Panasonic,I like this headphones

Well, I was wrong and the RP-HT21's have me sold. While the bass on these headphones is not powerful, as expected, shockingly everything else about the sound quality (to my untrained ears) is more than satisfactory. I remain using my expensive headphones for high quality sound largely for psychological reasons.

They have not broken or otherwise failed since I bought them 8 months prior to writing this review. I can hear audio from 40 Hz to 14500 Hz on a frequency spectrum video (http://youtu.be/qNf9nzvnd1k) with no quiet or dead zones.

The sound quality of these headphones is excellent- better than any other headphones or ear buds I've every used. My only complaint is that they feel a little snug on my ears, and I don't think I have a large head or anything. It's definitely bearable, but since I wear glasses, I do have to shift them around every now. That said, if something were to happen to these (like someone stole them or I broke them somehow), I would order them again because the sound quality is so good that I will tolerate the tight fit.",Excellent sound quality!

This set is very inexpensive and I was concerned the quality would be low at best. To my surprise I find these headphones excellent with one caveat. I wish they could be a bit louder - maybe 20% or so. Could be the function of my Sansa but the earbuds get plenty loud.

9,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, May 5 2014,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR
Best, most durable, decent sounding headphones that give so so much value for money.
You don't have to read the entire review. You can just buy and try them out. You won't even feel bad if you don't like them for whatever reason because they cost less than a Subway Footlong.

I bought these headphones in the Spring of 2011 for an astonishing $4.58. That's the most I could afford back then and I wasn't expecting a lot out of them. All I wanted was a device so that my roommates wouldn't have to listen to me practice amateur keyboard.
I was waiting to write the review till something went wrong with these headphones. I am glad I had to wait 3 years! In fact, it's been more than 3 years and today, the pad on one of the sides tore. After thousands of hours of usage, the only thing wrong with them now is that the soft, cushiony pad tore.

Durability: 10/10
These are the most durable headphones. The wire is intact. The headband is intact with its adjustment mechanism working just fine. The earpieces are fine. And all this with its fair share of getting tugged and tangled and dropped and stepped on. Not just the headphones category but considering all categories, I cannot think of a single product that was less than $5 and has been usable for over 3 years.

Comfort: 10/10
They are extremely lightweight; so much so that you could forget you have them on if no sound were playing.
The headband doesn't press on your ears and is sufficiently adjustable.

Sound quality: 7/10
It has a surprisingly soft and rich bass with good, sharp mid and treble sound. It is no Bose or Audio-Technica but neither does it cost as much. It is 1/20th the cost of a Bose AE2. It is also sufficiently loud and the sound doesn't crack at max volume.
All this make them perfect for music, movies, podcasts as well as phone conversations (there is no mic, but still).",3 years and still the best!

So, when I saw that I could order these from Amazon for the same price that I had paid in the store, I got two. That way I can have one pair with my IPod, one with my radio, and one for travel. I find them to be very comfortable and the sound is great. I know they are not up to Bose standards, but that is OK with me.

I guess it is a little unfair. The headphones themselves are amazing! The bass is really good with songs. BUT, unlike someone else's comment (which swayed my decision to purchase a little), it is not a good size for even kids. I have a really small head and these do not fit me. Plus, I have TMJ and somehow, it squeezes my jaw and it hurts after a few minutes. Ouch. So be aware when buying these that you are sure about the size. They extend quite a bit. So, I think the issue is having a really small head. Although, I am not sure about the other extreme (having a really big head). Ha. I guess the same issue would arise. I have no idea. I wish my head were bigger and my jaw was not so messed up... These are really great headphones otherwise. But, from my experience alone, I have to give a lower rating... Booo. Lol.",Oi

I got my first set with a Panasonic portable CD player, probably about 1990 or so. A relative had a set of Sony lightweights, at the time, that were not nearly as good. I have purchased several more since then and they have all been excellent. They all still work, but a couple are glued back together due to accidental damage. When I went out to find replacements for them I tried a number of much higher priced phones that didn't sound as good, in my opinion. I play solo acoustic guitar and I want phones that accurately reproduce the guitar's sound. These phones do it well. They have a good bass without it being overpowering. I think that they are the best bang for the buck out there. I just purchased a set of Koss KPH7 headphones that cost nearly as much but aren't nearly as good as the Panasonic phones. The Koss phones have poor volume and no bass. I plan to buy another set of the Panasonic phones soon.

There is one small issue-- there may be a slight 'short' somewhere in the circuitry (I'm no expert so this is the best I can explain it), so depending on how the connecting wire lays on a surface, you may not get full sound quality in both ears. I've found a workaround where I position the wire on top of of the chassis of my laptop and that seems to give me full stereo sound in both ears. And once that issue is worked out, the sound is surprisingly full, even more concentrated than when I listen without headphones (I guess I need to attach additional speakers to my laptop to get that same surround sound without headphones).

Until I get those other more expensive headphones of my dreams, these will suffice.",Works surprisingly well for it's price with a caveat

I ended up stealing a pair for myself. I abandoned headphones for ear buds a few years ago and these things have convinced me to switch back. The sound quality is much better then any pair of ear buds I have ever owned. The only complaint is that they don't handle bass heavy music very well.

Was this review helpful to you?, August 22 2013,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used these headphones for years, for listening to music on numerous systems, hooked up to a desktop stereo as well as a laptop computer. I own more than one pair, use them constantly, and did not think much about them. They were cheaper than dirt and did the job.
But in hindsight, and now that I have devoted a bit more time evaluating many other headphones, I took these outstanding Panasonics for granted. THESE ARE EXCELLENT HEADPHONES.

Their sound is exceptional. They should not be disrespected or dismissed. They blow away inexpensive headphones that look similar to it. And shockingly, they blow away many full-sized headphones,including some that cost 20 times more, $100 and up, particularly in terms of treble clarity.

This may seem like a bold claim, but I stick by it: these are better than many headphones on the market. Yes, it makes sense to maintain reasonable expectations (these are, after all, under $10 headphones) but the RP-HT21s far---far---exceed these expectations. In addition to being among my go-to headphones for daily use, they are so good, I use them to test audio gear, and as a reference versus other headphones.

The RP-HT21s offer clear, crisp, well-defined mids and sparkling highs. Wonderfully bright and airy, no muddiness or veil. In fact, the treble is so good that I include these among my treble reference headphones when testing and comparing other headphones. It leans towards cool rather than warmer, in tone. The sharp clarity is this set's strength. The bass is tight, clean and solid. It is not boomy, loose nor overwhelming in quantity but enough for any music.The imaging is extremely clear. These little headphones even offer a bit of soundstage with good imaging and separation.

Again, keep in mind that the drivers are small. Don't expect a big picture or full sound like that offered by full-sized cans, but if you appreciate the sound of clean, brighter headphones (Grado, AKG, Beyerdynamic), you will like what the RP-HT21s offer within its capabilities.

The drivers are 30mm. They are fairly easy to drive: low impedance (24 ohm) but sensitivity is medium (100 db). I find that I have had to turn them up a minor notch or two for volume.

They are ideal for use through smaller sources, but I find that they sound just as fine over larger stereo systems. I tested them through various sources, and they sound great through all of them, small as well as bigger. They are good without EQ. With EQ, they can be fine tuned to even more impressive levels. Bumping up the bass a few notches, and the treble just a bit (I love detail) can really transforms the RP-HT21s into the surprise performers. They also respond well to amping. Just be careful not to blow them out.

These super light portables are ideal for indoor listening. For outdoor use, they are certainly portable, but they are open air. These are on-ear headphones---as in small drivers right on the opening of your ear. There is no real seal. Which means that you will also hear everything in the room around you, no isolation. If you are type that listens outdoors at high volume, a set of full sized closed headphones would of course be better. These are best at low to medium volume, they struggle a bit when cranked up. For quieter listening, the Panasonics make me very happy.

The build quality of these is actually better than similar cheap plastic headphones, just a bit more sturdy. The fit can start out a bit tight, very snug on the head, but they break in, no problem. They are comfortable on the ear, and I often prefer them to full-size headphones that can get hot. The foam covers are replaceable, but the headphones are so cheap, it makes more sense to just buy a whole new set if the covers wear out.

I am finding that good versions of these types of headphones have become more difficult to get, and these Panasonics really are far better than the Maxell HP-200, Coby CV-H32 and other terrible cheapie throwaways; the ones that look similar, and are sold with computer equipment and given away on airplanes. They are vastly superior to cheap ear buds and IEMs. They beat or compete admirably against portables such as the Koss Porta Pro, Koss KSC75 (which costs more than twice as much), and the Sennheiser PX100 and PX100 II, which are ten times more expensive.

The L-shaped plug and cord are of better quality than the flimsy wires you might find on other phones in the same bottom end price range.

The RP-HT21s get my vote as the best sounding dirt cheap headphones out there. And they may also be the cheapest good headphones out there, too. These are under $10 headphones, capable of real surprise. So cheap, you can try them without guilt. And if you love them like I do, own many pairs.

Even if you have other good headphones, it is worth having these.",Shockingly good. High quality sound regardless of price---which happens to be dirt cheap

I have tried, and still own, in ear ""bud"" headphones, behind the neck in-ear headphones, medium cup sized over-ear headphones, and huge over-ear closed style headphones. All have their perks, and unfortunately negatives too.

The in-ear type of headphones would actually cause me physical pain only shortly after wearing them. The little ones, buds, with the little suction type end piece hurt the most. And the portable factor was dismissible once I realized I had to fight to untangle them each time I wanted to use them. The around the neck in-ear headphones, but no ""suction cup"", would typically yield better results in regards to the length of time before pain commenced. They still hurt after some time, and because the pressure of the band was suppose keep them on your head they weren't very practical for quickly taking off. This also made having them around your neck uncomfortable.

Moving on I then tried headphones with over-ear designs. I ended my search with my Audio-technica monitor headphones (ATH-A700). I love them, for the most part. Audio quality is superb, and the comfort of the band is great, as the wing design fits to your head. They have a closed back design so it helps keep outside noise at a reduced level. These positives unfortunately came with some big negatives though. One, obviously, they are not very portable, and much less practical to use in public. Secondly, due to me spending large amounts of time using headphones for work, school, and hobbies, My neck would start to ache. The sheer weight of the headphones was actually causing pain in my neck around my shoulder area. Keep in mind, I was wearing them for close to 5-8 hours straight, so I'm not knocking the ATH-A700s, I still love them.

Now the Panasonic RP-HT21. I was doing my normal shopping on amazon when I decided to throw these headphones into my cart as an add on item. I thought to myself,

""What the heck, why not? Would be nice to have a pair I could throw around, travel with. They have to be super light by the looks of them, which has a bunch of benefits in itself. They look like the headphones I had in the 90s though, so there's a chance they sound like crap. I mean it's been close to two decades, technology of headphones has to have drastically changed. Ah, for the money, its worth a shot.""

Got them, opened, popped into my clip+, hit play. Simply put, I love them. These headphones have obviously exceeded my expectations. They are light, audio quality is good, and the form factor is perfect for traveling and using in public. The biggest plus to these headphones is that they are extremely comfortable, and I mean they are almost ""not there"" comfortable. Not to mention, the price is fantastic.

I will be buying probably around 2-3 more pairs, so I have backups, and a couple to tinker on. I'm thinking of adding a Rean plug and maybe some braided cord, just for fun not because it's needed.","Fantastic Headphones, even in the year 2012"

As such, I don't mind if these get lost or stolen since the price point is right. The biggest surprise is the bass response. Although it is not as deep as my Bose, it is impressive. The mids and highs are right there also. Additionally, the cable plug is an L and quite durable. For the price, it is an extremely good buy. These are ""over the ear"" and are quite comfortable.

The headphone jack is the old style for CD players. Doesn't fit an iPod case which most people use. The 3.5mm plug fits, yet requires removing any iPod case to fully plug, make full connection. Misleading; this should be specified on product page. I had to return these.

This product would be incredible if you'd update the plug to fit through a iPod case and add a microphone to one of the wires, like Apple earbuds have. This way these could be used for calls with an iPhone as well. I prefer to use lightweight over-ear headphones as ear buds put EMFs to far inside my ear, which causes pain. Please make a solid pair of lightweight over-ear headphones with a mic and proper plug for cases.",Headphone jack doesn't fit through most iPod cases

I know ""sounds good"" is totally subjective and FWIW, I do audio editing and mixing on PreSonus Studio One software with a $350 pair of studio headphones, so for casual listening I expect something pretty decent.

I didn't want to spend $35, so decided to give these a try due to the good reviews. After using them for a week, I'm planning on buying a new set of PortaPros.

Pros:
-Cheap
-Long, flexible cord

Cons:
-Comfort. The ear pads are small and sit in the center of my ear instead of over the entire ear. The band is tight and presses the pads directly into the ear canal. The pads have one axis that they can rotate about instead of two like my old Koss set, so they never quite align properly anyway. My ears get sore after using them for about an hour.
-Sound is a bit tinny and quiet (need to play my devices at a higher volume than before)
-Why have a 90 degree plug that will just bend when plugged into a device in your pocket?",Uncomfortable

The price makes it a steal pretty much given the brand and the quality it provides. It's rich with enhancing features such as the longer cord that allows for more movement (was a must for me, the short cord problem I had was starting to drive me insane), surprisingly lightweight (than was expected ) which will make longer sessions more comfortable, plush padded ear pads for more comfort. Hell I'll probably fall asleep in them sooner or later with all this comfort lol

I am very impressed with the sound of these headphones, especially the bass response. For a lightweight, inexpensive pair they really sound terrific compared to all the other cheapies I've bought over the years. I use them for podcasts on the treadmill and tv when my wife's asleep but, they sound good for music as well. The plastic headband may not work well for bigheads (despite what my wife says, I do NOT have a big head!). I wear a 7 1/2 hat and they are perfect without even extending the ear pads. It doesn't seem flimsy at all though so they will probably endure a little stretching without snapping. The pads are pretty comfortable on the ears and the swivel is a good feature. I will buy more of these in the near future.",I am very impressed with the bass response of these headphones...

Was this review helpful to you?, November 25 2008,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about these headphones. I'm use to the big, bulky kind and the little ear plugs. I hate the ear plugs, but traveling on a bus or walking down the street with an MP3 and the big ones isn't exactly any better. These are.

They are lightweight and have an awesome sound quality. I couldn't believe I could have my volume on the lowest setting (on my laptop) and it still be too loud. Another reviewer mentioned the bass. It is astounding. I was so use to my big and bulky (and old) ones for laptop listening, and with these new ones I'm hearing the music in such a better way.

The only (slight) issue I have with them is I find myself fidgeting with their placement on my head. It's not a big or constant deal, and maybe it will go away the more I wear them. I've owned them for a month now. It's as if they feel too light, or they move easier than the big ones do since they don't cup around your ear.

All in all, I still highly recommend them.",Great Headphones!

Unbelievably, these headphones made it through an entire year of school and have followed our girls into 1st and 3rd grade!

Pros
+ Unbelievably durable, it they can survive a year with a kindergartener they can survive anything
+ Sound is great for the price. Of course there are far better sounding headphones, but at less than $5 the sound is a real achievement
+ Crazy good value
+ Good surface area on top of band perfect for a name label

Cons?
- If the price climbs to $10 then I will try to come up with a con, but at this price, I can't fault these phones at all

Was this review helpful to you?, May 13 2012,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading so many positive reviews and seeing the price I was almost skeptical about the performance of these headphones. The sound is a nice step up from the stock Apple Earbuds, which sounded muddy and distorted no matter the source or EQ settings. They were also a pain to keep in my ears. These are light and comfortable, even moreso with the ear pads taken off which lowers the temps they will reach while on your head plus the sound seems a touch clearer. I taped off the XBS ports and it seems to give a fuller bass sound with a smoother roll off (kinda reminds me of the sound of bass from a sealed box vs. a ported box). These aren't audiophile phones but most likely the best you're going to do for under $10 and is a lot better than what they ship with most portable audio devices. A final note, I see many people saying the Bass is strong. I disagree but then again I love strong bass. I'd explain these 'phones as being a fuller bass and treble setup with both somewhat drowning out mids. However, these respond better to EQ'ing than the Apple 'buds, so some customization is possible.",Great budget replacements for stock headphones.

The right speaker no longer works, and Panasonic won't send me a replacement unless I spend my own money mailing the defective unit to them first, which of course would cost more than what I paid for the original product. Panasonic has probably the worst automated phone assistance of any company I've ever dealt with. They require you to say out loud what your problem is, but if you say ""headphone"" the system takes you to the cellphone menu, and if you say the model no. (RP-HT21) it takes you to the razer blade menu. If you can keep your sanity long enough to make it to a customer service rep they will then forward your call to another customer service rep who in turn will take about 10 to 15 minutes before answering your call. They will then give you a case number, and ask you to call back after emailing the appropriate information to them. The automated system does not recognize the phrase ""case number"", however, so you will once again be waiting a good 20 to 25 minutes before talking to an actual person again. You can also, like I did, try emailing them beforehand to avoid this. I lasted four days without a response before subjecting myself this, maybe you can last longer.

The only thing I use these headphones for is listening to music on my smartphone while I go for walks.

I use them at least 1 to 3 hours every day checking the web for new music or watching some movies and I don't even know I'm wearing them most of the time. They do have a tendency to slip a little but just tighten the headband and they should be fine. The cord isn't that long so don't expect to get up and walk around while working on your computer. They're made of plastic and aren't meant for little children to play with or use or they'll surely end up broken.

Don't get me wrong - they are OK for music but not great and would never be my first choice for Beethoven's 7th Symphony - but considering their price, they're not bad.

The voice quality for audiobooks is crisp and clean and you can still hear what's going on around you (very little isolation). They are also comfortable and I have worn them for over two hours at a time.

Did I mention that they are cheap. I have a pair in the bedroom, one in a travel bag, and a spare for when one of my cats decides to chew on another pair's wires!

Was this review helpful to you?, September 6 2011,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For less than $5, these headphones are very good quality. They're very light and produce clear sounds. However as you can probably guess from the size, they won't go as high a volume without distortion or give you much bass. I bought these because during summer wearing my over-the-ear headphones can get a little stuffy on the computer and I wanted light headphones that feel like I'm not wearing them.

So far these feel great and light enough that I almost feel like I'm not wearing any headphones. Also, they have not caused any discomfort to my ears after 5 hours of constant use. They stay on the ears very well and will not fall off even when I shake my head hard.

I give 4/5 for comfort. I feel the cushion on these headphones should be a little thicker on the edges because the plastic edges can be felt on the ears and is not as comfortable as I'd like it.

Also the sound gets 4/5 because it's easily distorted with high volume, volume doesn't go high enough in some applications, and although the bass is present, it's weak.","Great buy for the price, don't expect anything amazing."
9,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, June 23 2011,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two pairs of the Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones because I pretty much love everything about them. I've read where a couple of reviewers have called them ""Good for the price"", but in fact, they're a great deal better than a number of different brands of headphones that are considerably higher priced.

PROS: These headphones, while certainly not symphony quality, are more than adequate for an evening's work or play on my computer, or with my phone and mp3 players. They're lightweight, they're comfortable in the extreme, and I'm impressed with both their higher and bass ranges, sound-wise. Though they're probably considered ""open air"" phones, they do quite a good job of blocking out outside sounds, since they cover most of the ear. Unless it's awfully hot out, they also breathe pretty well, and so don't overheat my ears, even if I've been wearing them for a couple of hours.

CONS: The only real ""con"" I can find with these headphones is that they don't survive ME very well! As I said, this is the second pair of RP-HT21's I've owned, and it's the second pair I've broken an earphone off of! The first pair took it in the neck, so to speak, when I accidentally stepped on them (barefooted, and it wasn't a full-weight crunch, either); the second pair got sat on while on the bed. My fault in both cases, and a bit of tape will hold them together this time. Still, though they still ""wear"" fine, every time I pull them off now, I have to put them back together.

Despite this con, these Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones are worth way more than their price; indeed, they'd be more than worth it at TWICE their price. I will definitely be getting another set of them.

In fact, I think I'll buy a FEW pairs this time!",Love These Earphones--But Wish They Survived ME Better!

they manufacture the plug with a 90 degree turn immediately that the jack exits the laptop connector. And in that right-angle area, they use very hard plastic.
This jack should prove indestructible.
I do hope that all 3.5mm audio jacks move to this type of design, so I can avoid having to buy 3.5 audio splitters with 2 male connectors and 1 female, just to protect the 180 degree jacked devices, which become worthless when their jack is slightly bent.

They reminded me of the ones that came with the old portable CD players.

My biggest complaint is that they don't fit snug on my head so the sound volume is very low. The earpiece is made of foam padding. If I press the ear cups to my ear, the sound is ample and very clear. But I wouldn't want to hold my hands in that position for very long.

I plan to invest in a good full sized set of headphones to get the fit I want. I am not concerned too much about portability since I usually listen to music in my recliner.

Two Drawbacks:

1. The ear pads were a bit thin and caused minor irritation. I had a spare pair of replacement pads (can be bought on Amazon for a few dollars for 3 sets). This made them very comfortable.

2. I really had to turn up the sound to get to normal levels. (Yes, I tried them with the original pads). Not sure of the cause. Not really a nuisance, but it makes you wonder about the quality.

As far as the product goes, if you are someone looking for a plain old pair of normal headphones, I see no reason to not buy these Panasonic's.

Pros:
-They are very lightweight
-They are comfortable
-Over the ear headphones, so you do not have to worry about them falling out of your ear like a pair of in-ear ones would at this price point.
-Sound: for 5 bucks, I was highly impressed. They are not your Bose headphoes, but they work.

Cons:
-The actual headphone was tad bit smaller then expected.

Also, the angle of the ear pieces is too much and so I have too much pressure on the face-side of them. my old headphones rotated horizontally and vertically, but these do not. comfort is so individual, so they could be great on tons of people, just not me. i don't see why manufacturers have such limited adjustments - when the headband is fully expanded, I'd bet not too many people wear them that long.

Since I also left a logitech headset at someone's house, I... for the time being, in need of a new headphones. After reading reviews, I decided to buy this one because it was cheap.

This is a good back-up headphones. I am currently using it every-time I go on my laptop, and I had been on my laptop basically every time when I wake up. At the price I bought for $4.51, this beats almost all the 10$, 20$, 32$ headphones and headsets I got from friends and families in the pasts. I estimate that 5/9 of my wired headphones had their wires ripped off.

The problem with this, for me, is that it isn't loud enough in some circumstances. On my laptop, Youtube for example, I had to raise my laptop's volume and Youtube' video's volume to maximum. Some videos are not loud enough, and sometimes, difficult to hear. If I ever pull the cable out of my laptop, my laptop would be soaring so loud. In comparison to my previous broken headphones, the previous one is more louder that I usually set my laptop's volume to around 20%-40%.

Nevertheless, the volume are good. Yet, raising the volume somewhat causes another problem - statics. I hear/sense statics from videos and musics, especially music. For musics, I usually have collections in FLAC formats, known as (Free Lossless Audio Codec), which means I am listening to musics without any loss in quality. I can hear statics sometime.

One thing I did noticed is that I bought a Samsung 3.5mm to micro-usb adapter to listen to music from my cellphone, straight through the headphones. My previous headphones had thumping noises like it was making a beat per second. This headphones is crystal clear [FlAC and well-quality-mp3 musics that is].

For a headphones that cost almost 5$, it is worth it.",A good headphones; Not loud enough but it is decent

My old headset, which looks very similar, could be worn from the back of the head/neck. This means that when I go out walking or anywhere else where I want to wear a hat, I cannot use this headset.

As for the ""increased bass"" -- I did an A-B comparison with my old headset and they sounded very similar in quality overall. If the RP-HT21 has more bass, my impression is that they simply attenuated the high frequencies (making the bass more predominant), as the maximum overall volume from the RP-HT21 is not as high as with my old headset. This means that in a noisy environment, you may not be able to be able to hear it.

Was this review helpful to you?, April 7 2012,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to receive my headphones for my Kindle Fire. When I pluged it in, I did not expect static and off and on sound quality. I tried and tried to insert, but a little part of the plug shaft did not push in all the way.
After much disapointment, I returned to the store where I purchased the Kindle Fire, thinking that the device was broken.
I varified it, because all of the other headphones there also would not fit properly. One of them didn't work at all. They ware priced from about $89. to $150. I replaced my Kindle with a new one.(Make sure you keep your original box.) I though this would solve my problem. It didn't. The original headphone still has some static, but a little better continuing sound than on my previous Kindle.
Now I'm at a loss and will continue to find a solution for me by scouting out more headphones. Preferably a folding pair this time and hope it works. This is very important to me, as I travel and want to use the Kindle Fire. I like it a lot and do not need an Apple. At least not just yet. I notice that in other reviews, they do not mention the device they are using. It is hard to know if all headphones will work on all kinds of devices.",Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones

I also bought the Sennheiser HD 202 along with them. I returned the Sennheisers within a month because they gave me blisters but I kept these ones. That should vouch for how good these headphones really are.

Their sound reproduction is excellent and they are very light-weight and comfortable. My Sansa earphones slip off whenever they get a chance, but these stay on my head. Okay, so I don't jog or run with these on, but a very fast walk does not dislodge them. The bass is excellent, the mid-range is very lively and the high-frequencies are clear. They match the Sennheiser HD 202 in sound quality and are less than 1/4th the price.

8,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 27 2012,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tend to see a lot of reviews about headphones wherein the reviewer talks about how rough they are with their headphones. I don't necessarily think I'm rough with mine, although I do frequently, albeit accidentally, yank the cords. Fact is, I'm a tad clumsy and so I tend to buy cheaper headphones and I expect to have moderate quality sound. I also expect that I'll be required to replace the headphones in question in two or three years.

I had my last pair of Panasonic headphones - a $17 dollar pair, mind - for about seven years before I was forced to retire them because the cord had suffered one yank too many and the left speaker no longer carried sound. After browsing and looking over product reviews for various headphones, this pair seemed the right balance of functional and cheap to me, so I went ahead and bought it. The day I received it, I carefully got it out of the plastic and immediately plugged it in to my mp3 player and pressed play. First, let me say that I do find these comfortable to wear for extended time, and they are very lightweight so you can almost forget that you have them on. Now, I like the sound quality well enough, but there is one caveat to this: if the jack shifts at all, there is a slight static feedback in the headphones. This is kind of a pain for me, because I have an mp3 player so that I can listen to music while I'm running or at the gym, and the cord twists all the time, moving the jack when it does.

Overall, I'd say if you're buying headphones to plug them into a laptop or something that doesn't shift around a lot, then I think these are a fine solution. However, if you're planning on doing anything physical while using these, I hesitate to recommend them.","Good for sedentary use, but maybe not active use"

I'd been using cheap headphones for years, until about a year ago, when I bought a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-G1 for $30 that sound great, but are too uncomfortable to wear for a 2 hour movie. I'm not sure these headphones sound quite as good as the RP's, but the difference is less dramatic than you'd think, and for $4, you'll never find headphones in the same league. I believe that all but the most discerning audiophiles will find that these headphones are as good as they'll need for just about every imaginable use.

Was this review helpful to you?, October 25 2014,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a computer teacher at a middle school. I purchased these headsets for my students who need them and found them to be an economical product. It is only October so I cannot comment on their durability. Last year I purchased headsets that were $35 each and many of them broke. I figured if a headset is going to break it usually is at the wire connections. I will update this review later in the year to let you know their durability.,Economical and Practical

0,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 26 2010,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a set of these for someone that has problems wearing earbuds (IEM), as well as staying away from my JVC-HAFX67B. These phones are perfect for the pc or laptop if you're looking for a 'quick' and simple device to catch news-feeds or watching tutorial videos. Please note that these are not noise-canceling headphones, but for the price with shipping, you really can't go wrong and they are pretty comfortable around your ears!

About the phones:
Works well with computers but I wouldn't recommend tagging it along with your portable music device -- such as an iPod. The reason being is that they do not do a very good job of suppressing or isolating sounds, which means you can still hear ambient noise and people sitting around you can also hear them. The earcups are designed at an angle facing inwards from the front (shaping your ears) and out towards the rear, this is good for people with flappy ears, but not for me and probably the majority. To get the full sound I'd have to press and hold them in flat, the XBS Bass effect works well but all other frequencies quickly becomes muddled, and surely one can't be doing this all along while wearing it.

In retrospect, sound quality is decent, from a scale of 1 to 10 (being best) I'd say 6. You can hear the Bass but you won't feel it, it is there, only not as rich and tight. The Trebles could be better if it weren't for the Mids being a bit too high which resulted to somewhat of an overall 'flat' sounding device.

Back to the design as I mentioned before, the angled-cup design could be a small problem to some people. It is certainly for me because this also reduces the overall volume decibel compared to my uber-rich sounding JVC HAFX67B which at 25% volume level, I get a fairly high sound decibel as apposed to 50% level with the Panasonic. Also, I didn't like the angle plug, this could be a plus or minus to some. The reason: when it's plugged in to my Nano next to its charging socket, the angle-plug prohibits me to lay the Nano down on a flat surface, or I'd have to swivel the plug opposite but it'll stick up in the air (see my photos). In case you're asking, it CAN'T be swiveled to the sides because it is very tight with the charger plugged in, if I try, it WILL bend and damage the socket and phone jack plugs!

Pros:
Price, price and price (under 5 bucks)!
Free shipping
Decent sound
Bass (okay, but not rich or tight)

Cons:
Ear cup design
Angled Plug (may or my not be for others)
Flat sounding
Sound escapes even at decent volume levels","Good and decent, but not for everything"

Was this review helpful to you?, November 26 2010,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a set of these for someone that has problems wearing earbuds (IEM), as well as staying away from my JVC-HAFX67B. These phones are perfect for the pc or laptop if you're looking for a 'quick' and simple device to catch news-feeds or watching tutorial videos. Please note that these are not noise-canceling headphones, but for the price with shipping, you really can't go wrong and they are pretty comfortable around your ears!

About the phones:
Works well with computers but I wouldn't recommend tagging it along with your portable music device -- such as an iPod. The reason being is that they do not do a very good job of suppressing or isolating sounds, which means you can still hear ambient noise and people sitting around you can also hear them. The earcups are designed at an angle facing inwards from the front (shaping your ears) and out towards the rear, this is good for people with flappy ears, but not for me and probably the majority. To get the full sound I'd have to press and hold them in flat, the XBS Bass effect works well but all other frequencies quickly becomes muddled, and surely one can't be doing this all along while wearing it.

In retrospect, sound quality is decent, from a scale of 1 to 10 (being best) I'd say 6. You can hear the Bass but you won't feel it, it is there, only not as rich and tight. The Trebles could be better if it weren't for the Mids being a bit too high which resulted to somewhat of an overall 'flat' sounding device.

Back to the design as I mentioned before, the angled-cup design could be a small problem to some people. It is certainly for me because this also reduces the overall volume decibel compared to my uber-rich sounding JVC HAFX67B which at 25% volume level, I get a fairly high sound decibel as apposed to 50% level with the Panasonic. Also, I didn't like the angle plug, this could be a plus or minus to some. The reason: when it's plugged in to my Nano next to its charging socket, the angle-plug prohibits me to lay the Nano down on a flat surface, or I'd have to swivel the plug opposite but it'll stick up in the air (see my photos). In case you're asking, it CAN'T be swiveled to the sides because it is very tight with the charger plugged in, if I try, it WILL bend and damage the socket and phone jack plugs!

Pros:
Price, price and price (under 5 bucks)!
Free shipping
Decent sound
Bass (okay, but not rich or tight)

Cons:
Ear cup design
Angled Plug (may or my not be for others)
Flat sounding
Sound escapes even at decent volume levels","Good and decent, but not for everything"

I was replacing an old pair of titanium headphones from RS. I may have gotten spoiled on the RS phones as they had excellent sound quality for a set of small phones.

However, it has one Achilles Heal: The right-angle 3.5mm plug at the end of the cord is prone to internal breakage.
All these reviews citing one speaker going out unless you hold the cord just right, or one speaker dying after a few weeks, are probably due to this weakness.

I've owned 5 pairs over the past few years and all have died for this reason. Mine last from 6 months to a year.

Years ago they were $2.50. The price has crept up but the cord quality has not.

Given this serious limitation, an otherwise excellent unit.",Excellent set with one persistent fault - internal cord breakage.

The overall sound is surprisingly rich for a pair of headphones this price (I paid about $6.50).

To put the price/quality in perspective; I feel like the next significant step up from these would be something like the Sony MDR ZX300 headphones, which I purchased for about $25.00 and sound significantly better.

I bought mine for almost $5 back in 09/2011. I was a little wary about the price thinking that the quality would suffer greatly. Reading the reviews, however, I was assured that this would be a good buy.

Functionality 2/2

These headphones get the job done. I don't like ear buds because I don't like shoving stuff into my ears, so I wanted a good pair of headphones to listen to music from my laptop. I have a lot of ear buds, all freebies with other purchases or as part of a promotion on my college campus. Some of the other consumers' commented on a really cool bass sound, and when I first started using these headphones, I recognized it, which was an unnecessary plus. A year later though, I can't really distinguish it anymore, but that might just be because I am so used to it.

Endurance 0.75/1

Some of the other reviews commented on poor endurance, but mine is still going strong. I have even slept with them on when I wanted to block out noise, and they have still managed to stay together. Sitting still, sleeping--these headphones haven't gotten broken yet. I deducted 0.25 points because the wires have slightly melted causing them to coil up. The headphones still work, but they're not in the best condition. The wire deterioration is probably due to my own laptop heating up when I play an online game or stream a movie or television episode.

Other 1/1

The size is easily adjustable. There is some sound leakage if the volume is high enough, but I shouldn't be blasting music at that high of a volume in the first place. The foam and band sometimes messes up my hair, but that's not big enough of a deal for me to take away from its quality and value.

These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package. Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though. These headphones don't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in-ear (ear buds) do either. I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head. The more you sweat and move the more they slip. It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set. Bottom line: If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones...especially for the money - you just can't. Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating, even yard work, then go with something like the Philips SH390 (inexpinsive around $13.00) that are snug.

I ripped them out of the plastic with the tenacity of a spoiled kid with his hands on a present on Christmas morning, and popped them into the computer; went on Youtube to listen to some of my old school (D-Train/The System/etc.). Now, I'm pretty picky when it comes to headphones because I like to hear every single note, chime, hand clap, drum beat..ya know, the rhythm - and the sound on these headphones are EXCELLENT. I hear ALL of the sounds.

These headphones are nicely sized and the extension length is more than enough for even the biggest of heads - well, except for Jimmy Neutron and the kid from 'Hey Arnold'. The padding feels comfortable, and doesn't sponge up your ears like some other headphones I've bought do; very lightweight, and they fit snugly yet firmly enough on your head - so feel free to do some hardcore headbanging to your favorite rock songs.

Now, about the bass..and I aint talking about fish - it's RICH. I've got the volume up to full blast, nothing sounds distorted. It's THAT good.

However, this is about the 10th set of headphones I have tried over the last couple of years. I've bought wired, wireless, brand name, off-brand, etc. And, by far, these are the best. The sound quality off a Sansa Fuze MP3 player is superb (and that player doesn't have much oomph).

I wanted something I could use on the elliptical that I wouldn't care if I ruined them after a period of time. Now, the catch will be, how long these last! As I'm getting older my hearing is getting worse and worse and I hope to use these for learning new languages.

Normally, one would say, ""well, for the price, they're pretty good."" Let me assure you. You could spend much more and get much less quality. If you have problems with ear-bud type headphones (which I do) you will love these!

Also, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. I've just placed an order for two more just in case they break sooner than I expect! This is where the price makes all the difference in the world.",Unbelievable - especially for the price!

Was this review helpful to you?, January 28 2012,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these because I wanted an extra pair of headphones and the price and reviews were amazing. The sound seems fine, though I'm no audiophile. I wanted to mention for the benefit of others that the band is quite tapered and also the tension is pretty tight, so when they are firmly seated on my head, they do feel tight. After an hour or so, they are uncomfortable to me and even hurt. If I loosen the band, it's a bit better but they slide around or fall off. For now I have to position them slightly off the front of my ears, which means the sound isn't as good. I'm hoping they stretch a little with use. In the meantime, use will be only for short periods.

Updated review: After a few months of use, the tension in these headphones had relaxed to the point where they are comfortable to wear. They've held up very well.",Important note on the size

They have amazing bass response for such an inexpensive headphone, and sound much better than my stock Apple earbuds; they're also quite comfortable.

Even though I own the Bose QuietComfort headphones, I find myself using these almost all of the time due to their small size and good-enough sound.

It is very narrow. The only adjustment is vertical. If you have a narrow head (whether tall or short) this could work well. If your narrow head is tall the adjustment could help.

If you wear a medium or slightly larger hat size, forget it. There is a lot of pressure built in. While it may fit on your head the pressure against the ears may be somewhere between painful and uncomfortable - and highly distracting. Unlike many headsets (going back to the 1980s walkman headsets) this one breaks tradition and is not very adjustable.

Unfortunately it cannot be returned since it is in a blister package that cannot be opened unless it is cut open.

The problem is that they are very uncomfortable. The plastic headband is molded onto the very front of the ear pieces. This causes the ear pieces to be squeezed forward pinching the front of the ear. My Koss brand earphones that these were supposed to replace has the headband molded to the center of the earpiece. This makes them much more comfortable. Also because the Koss brand cover the ear better (flatter) the volume does not have to be as high. Do to this problem I cannot recommend product.,The sound through the earphones is good.

Great for walkers, joggers and for anyone who doesn't want large cans on their head. These sound great and are a superb value. Purchased two pair for women who take voice lessons and have repertoire and training CD's to learn. Choir and quartet singers. You won't be disappointed. Not audiophile but real close. They are a little safer for walking than ear buds. They go on top of the ear so a little ambient noise like cars and horns gets through. For a laptop, i-phone or cell (typical stereo mini plug) these are perfect. Light as a feather at 1.7 oz including the wire you can run through your clothing. I estimate the headphone portion is 1.2 oz. Buy a spare while you're ordering.","Wow! A musician's quality headphone at a poor musician's price. Perfect for joggers, spinners, walkers."

One year follow-up review: I have had no problems, and even more, they keep sounding better. They actually are quite comfortable for long term listening (a movie on my computer) and seem to be better built than most. These headphones require an extended break-in. They definitely sound better now than new and their bass just keeps getting better. Still no comparison to my Sennheisers, but great for keeping with my computer or for a quick listen to something. The absolute best 'el-cheapo' headphones around! I've tried many and compared these to all my friends cheap headphones and these are more than just head and shoulders better!

Was this review helpful to you?, June 23 2012,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid something like $4.50 for these headphones, and that INCLUDED the shipping from the vendor that was selling them through Amazon. To put this in perspective, I would have to pay more than that for ONE BEER at the local pub, and that investment would disappear into my belly in a matter of moments. These headphones, on the other hand, have already provided me with countless hours of entertainment (and they're calorie free)!

There is no better deal out there for comfortable, quality headphones. I've used these almost every day for the past couple of months, for any length of time between 2 and 6 hours while at work. I've had the opportunity to borrow high end headphones from friends and coworkers, like Bose and Beats. Are the Beats better than these four dollar headphones? Yes, of course they are. But they are not 40x better (roughly the extra amount of money you would have to pay for them)! I use headphones all the time, I'm hard on them, and they all will eventually break. I would much rather replace these $4 headphones (I already ordered another pair, to have on hand), than ship off my $300 headphones for service.

And they're not junk, not by any means. The sound quality is excellent (for the average listener, like me), and the bass is very, very good. Build quality is excellent (especially when you consider the price), with a thick cord and nothing that feels flimsy.

I never listen to rock, hip-hop, rap, or the sounds of train wrecks. Bass to me means tight, deep, sonorous, well-intonated double bass (i.e., contrabass, upright acoustic bass), not the moo-moo-burp-moo boomy, muddy bass that generally comes out of rock bass guitars. These cheap little headphones deliver the kind of bass I want to hear. The mid and treble instruments sound great, too. And they're comfortable; I could wear them for hours at a time. I personally prefer a one-sided cord, but that's not likely to be found in a cheap headphone. In any case, I would gladly give that up for phones of this quality at this price.

I've been using Sennheiser PX 100 phones with iTunes on my computer for years, and these Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones compare very favorably at a fraction of the price. You need to adjust the volume up somewhat compared to the PX 100s, which is easy enough to do, and after I do that I'm not sure I could tell them apart. The RP-HT21s don't fold up, but I use them at several locations around my home so that doesn't matter.

I am very sensitive to bad sound. I cannot believe how good these headphones are.
They are better than headphones I have used costing 10 times as much
not only soundwise but also comfortwise. These are amazingly comfortable
and very light on my head. I cannot stand headphones that make me feel
like my head is in a vise. They also allow reasonable outside sounds to
come thru, like when the nurse calls me into the doctor's room. and you
can hear your stop when riding the bus.
Pros: Great bass, highs and a sweet natural sound. What more could you want? How about picking up sounds you never even heard before on your old
headphones. Great comfort. I'll probably hit the plastic band with a bit
of hairdryer to soften and bend the plastic to make them even a wee bit looser on my head (I said I'm very critical). Don't do this while its attached to your mp3 player. Price under $5.00 including shipping? They fit perfectly in the
little camera bag I carry my mp3 player in (the Sandisk Fuze 4gb player).
Also, the accessories I got for my Sandisk were amazingly cheap and included shipping.
Cons: None

Anyone who has ever owned an older style knows what I am talking about. Maybe a headband or something when jogging will get these bad boys fitting snug right up to the ear consistently.

I've replaced all the other cheap headphones that came with mp3 players, etc. We have never had a pair of these stop working after three years.

The one complaint for us is that the cord contains two wires all the way from the plug up to the headset. The two separate wires are joined together, but our 6 year old enjoyed splitting those two apart. So we ended up with what seems like a lot of wires all flopping around, getting tangled, etc. She did that to three pair over the course of several weeks before I realized what she was doing and put a stop to it. But, even so, none of those pair have stopped working. Just a bit of a pain to deal with. But, as I said, this is more about our child than the headphones themselves. But, if the cord were a single, it couldn't be split.

Also, these aren't officially ""kid's headphones"" so they don't adjust down small enough to fit securely on tiny heads. But for less than $5 a pair, I've not minded bending the metal to help them fit better.","Great value, great for daily use for kids"

Was this review helpful to you?, November 3 2013,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking to purchase a few low cost headphones for computer use in my house with 2 children. I chose the over the ear type instead of buds because we were losing buds at the rate of 2 or 3 a week (seriously) between our house and our mini-van A/V setup. I figured over the ear headphones would be harder to lose for the kids and easier for me to find since 1) they were bigger and 2) the kids did not want to be seen outside the house with these :-). Also, losing headphones at this price point versus $20 ear buds is a little more tolerable.

Simply stated, for the price point, they cannot be beat. Build quality was not bad at all and I would classify them as durable. In fact, on the two sets I purchased, I found it to be better than expected. In terms of design, I think the best word to describe it could be: utilitarian. The headphones are very light weight. We found the cord more than long enough to plug into the headphone port of our monitors or laptops. BUT, if you need to run the cord a long length, like to the back to a CPU under the desk, you will need a simple extension such as Stereo Headphone Extension 12 feet 3.5mm. The over the ear padding was more than sufficient for its purpose in my opinion. However, other reviewers have remarked otherwise. The headphones are adjustable enough that they fit a wide range of heads in my house from mine, to both my 6 and 12 year old.

Sound quality is OK. That's about it. However, that was all I was looking for. For serious sound, my children and I rely on better quality ear buds anywhere from the $8 to $35 range.

They hold onto your head quite tightly, and also the pressure is just so that the drivers stay at a comfortable distance. What's nice is that you don't have to crank the volume, possibly damaging your ears, to get such clear, full range sound.

The only con is that you look like a grandpa or an 80s holdover, track suit not included. If sound and value are most important, and you don't have a big head, you owe it to yourself to at least try a pair.","near-audiophile quality, vending machine price, sticks on your head like glue"

thought vs. their earbuds and/or phones. That was about 1-1/2 weeks ago.
and I haveN'T seen them since. (the phones, that is; I always see sons at mealtimes)

I have had many headphones for years, from high-end Grados to mid- and low-end Sennheisers. Full- or compact-size and earbuds, you name it, I have owned them all.

This Panasonic RP-HT21 has a similar sound signature to Panasonic RP-HTX-7, a very fashionable pair that cost 6 times more. The sound stage is quite good and its bass response mimic what I hear from my Grados. The mid-range is as smooth, if not smoother, than Sennheiser's PX90/100/200. The one point deduction comes from the high-pitch sound, where it just broke apart. Other than that, it is hard to believe that a five-buck headphone can sound this decent.

If radio/TV use is your primary reason when selecting headphones, look no further.

If you want a casual music listen experience, this will be a serious content. IMHO, this has all Sennheisers (excluding earbuds) PX and HD series headphones beat (below 60-dollar range).

As long as its build quality (all cheap plastic mind you) holds up, this gotta be the king of all budget headphones when cost and sound quality are put into equation.

One minor note though, the all plastic headband snatches my hair when adjusting. I rarely get this kind of treatment from other cans.

I can't get through the workday without my music (and, despite having a thousand sets,I can't tolerate ear buds). Glad found them! They are inexpensive, lightweight and sound great!! Also, unlike many similar sets, the ear pieces pivot so you can get a nice snug fit (which, of course, makes the sound better). I'm glad I bought a second set! I would recommend them for anyone looking for a basic set of headphones!",Great for the price!!

The bass thumps wonderfully, and the sound is very crisp and clear. I do have a couple of issues with them though. First, sound leaks out of them pretty badly, especially in a quiet setting. I can set them down with music playing on a low volume and hear the song as clearly as if I had them on across the room. The other issue is the fit. Though they are adjustable, they're a little snug on my head near my ears, possibly because of my glasses. It's bearable, but it does get more and more uncomfortable over time.

I guess I can put something between the headphones and the top of my head, like maybe a small pair of socks rolled up.

Another good point about them is the length of the cable - it is almost 4 1/2 feet, which is 6 inches longer than my old headphones. This is good because the headphone jack on my desktop is too far away for my old headphones but these work fine.",Too big for my head

I probably have about 7 pair at any given time around the house - for my computer; in my gym bag for my mp3 player; connected to the television, in my briefcase - anywhere I want to use headphones.

Essentially I love them because:

***The sound is great - they carry more bass than Sony, Koss and other brand of headphones that I've found at the local drug store and have an all-around great range

***They are shockingly economical

***They are fairly well-made - I wear one set during my daily workouts at the gym and they hold up really well - my current set for about 2 years now

The only con, in my opinion, is that, because the cord extends out of EACH earpiece and then connects over the chest area, it's prone to getting tangled pretty easily in mobile situations, like storing them in a gym bag. Still, that's only a minor complaint and not something to lower a five star rating.",A GREAT INEXPENSIVE HEADPHONE - BEATS HEADPHONES TWICE THE PRICE

Various types of earbuds either fall out or get sweat on the diaphragm, which makes them unlistenable until they dry out. I could have gone with the $299 Beats phones like the NFL pros wear on TV commercials, but that seemed like a good way to waste $299 and quickly ruin nice headphones. For $8, these are perfect. They get very sweaty, but there's no degradation in sound quality. But I imagine I'll have to replace the black foam coverings at some point. Seems that those are easy and cheap to buy though. Would Bluetooth be nice? Sure. But since I stay put on the treadmill or elliptical, these do the trick and sound A-OK for my gym needs.

Update: I've now been using them for running, and they work great there too. They stay put on my head and the cord is long enough that there's plenty of slack (but not too much) from my head to my music player in my pocket.

This works well for that. At five samoleans how can you go wrong? And the headband design is easy for him to put on and fits his head okay. But personally as an adult I would not want to use these for music. Overall they sound quite poor, especially on fine acoustic or classical music. Though on lighter fare like pop music, the bass is surprising strong and pleasant. I'm not sure how the bass can be so wonderful, yet the overall fidelity sound like a tinny AM radio. I could probably use these for tasks or as a study aid, like for spoken language lessons, audio books, transcription, listening to lecture recordings - I guess anything but good music.

I bought these because I'd heard rumors that Panasonic makes good, and CHEAP, headphones. If these cans are any indication those rumors are true. Their sound, especially considering the price, while not perfect by any means is quite good. And the comfort factor is also good, at least for my head. The ear pads appear to be easy to replace, but the cord is not. But who cares, because for the money a new pair of headphones can be bought. So if your pet lynx chews the cord off, or you neighbor's anteater eats the ear pads you can just buy a new pair of these headphones instead of fiddling around replacing parts. So, the little Panasonics get five stars from me because their price to performance ratio is spot-on, unlike some very expensive, and underwhelming headphones which I've run into.
Would I buy the headphones again? You bet you anteater I would.","Not bad, not great....but...not bad sound, fit, but a bang-on price."

And in some weeks, all of them developed some problem or the other: either cord developed loose contact, one of the speakers broke, the headset piece broker, or some became just inconvenient to use long term: they were too tight, or hurt the ears or cord was too short.

So to end these problems for once and all, I went onto Amazon to buy an expensive set of headphones -- $50 to $100 range -- thinking atleast then I will have a set of reliable headphones with good quality sound.

Then I saw this model in the search results -- at the price of $4 -- with good reviews. I thought -- let me give this one try -- just one try -- its so cheap it wont harm... And I did. I ordered two of them -- they were so cheap. This turned out the best purchasing decision I have made for such a thing.

I was surprised when I received them - they were very comfortable, cord was the correct size, smooth on the ears. Sound quality was good too! I thought maybe these wont last -- they cannot -- at such a price.

But after seeing the reviews and hearing about how good the bass was, I gave these things a shot. The first song I listened to was Good Life by Onerepublic when they arrived. I was blown away by the sound quality and the bass of what I was hearing. The thing had terrific sound and bass with all my music and I'm so glad I purchased these headphones. These headphones are good in quiet settings, but its hard to hear the music if you are in a medium to high loud setting. Otherwise, great headphones for anyone. Get these as their quality and price can't be beat!","For the price, this is a STEAL!"

There's a time and place for most everything including headphones and these Panasonics for under $5 are amazingly effective for what I ask them to do which is, in the main, keep me entertained while going through my daily one hour workouts at the gym, mated to my ipod mini. I just don't like those ear buds which most people use these days as there's something about sticking them directly into the ear and hearing canal that has never been comfortable for me. Perhaps you feel the same? Anyway, back to the review:

The sound quality is very good, adjustable features to one's head are excellent and the light weight doesn't interfere with the work at hand. Plus, unlike other headphones I've tried (and rejected) for my main purpose of these, don't heat my head to the point of gushing out too much perspiration which would interfere with my focus and overall comfort level.

I just ordered a second pair to keep in reserve. At this price for this quality, you can get all you want to hold in reserve or alternate which is what I plan on doing, rotating them to spread out the normal wear and tear. They feel good, adjust easily, stay in place, look good and sound good. The best $5 you're likely to spend? If these headphones aren't it, they're definitely amongst the top candidates.",Outstanding VALUE and they get the job done

I usually just use typical iPod ear buds for regular use and a couple of brands of over-the-ear headphones for holding in place during running and strenuous workouts. My plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running. I realized that they wouldn't silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier, fully padded/insulated headphones do...but I had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds. I was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since I didn't want to completely tune out what was happening around me.

It didn't take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction. The in-your-ear buds cover outside noise better than these do. So, I thought...oh well, I'll just use them for regular indoor listening. They're certainly comfortable enough. But, they don't stay on...or at least they don't stay on me. I have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my ears.

The sound clarity is decent for the price. The cable is plenty long at about 4.5.' The XBS port is supposed to offer increased bass response. I maybe noticed a bit of difference there; but it's of little help when the headphones won't stay in place on my ears.",They didn't work well for me...good thing they were cheap

I was blown away by these things. Frequency response of 16HZ to22KHZ, I believe it (We can only hear 20HZ to 20KHZ).
Crisp, no crackle highs, and no distorted lows.
With plenty of POWER! I use these for about 6 hours a day, 7 days a week. they are so comfortable that after the first day of use, i forget they are on, and nearly yank my laptop off of the table! Don't let the first fit fool you when you first put them on. They start out snug, but soon you can't feel them. GREAT SOUND low or high volume, and with all styles of music. From Classical, to Hip Hop, to the guitar gods of the classic rock era. (Rest in piece Ronnie Montrose), who passed on last week. I listened to Town Without Pity, and Rock Candy for hours with these. I think the next set will last much longer, because i do a ""headphone check"" before I get up from my computer. This is another marriage saving feature. You can hear your wife talk to you, and answer her intelligently, not like buds. I just ordered 2 more of them, for UNDER $10.00 delivered (2 day shipping for free. I love Amazon Prime)!

These were as close as I could come to getting a pair like that, and I was glad I hunted them down when I heard how good the sound was. There were countless cheap replacement headphones released by companies like Memorex which seem to have left a lasting impression that headphones of this size and shape didn't sound good. This pair is a good example of how wrong that idea is. Headphones today seem to only come in earbud or full sized ear enclosing cups, and that's a shame. Headphones like these were popular during the era when people would jog with a portable cassette player, and I feel the size helps that application. Larger cups seem heavier and strain my neck after hours of such use. These have zero sound isolation, but that was part of the design. Don't get these for a recording studio. They're great for listening to an mp3, however.",and one of the first and best portable CD players

At the price I paid, I decided to buy two sets of these headphones, one for home and one for work. Now, the headphones are comfortable, and the sound is clear, although not very rich, but then these aren't high-end headphones so I didn't expect that.

But the plug does not seem to be within specifications. I have tried the headphones in: my iPod nano, my Android phone, my computer's direct audio jack in front, my computer's speaker jack, and an old mini-cassette recorder I haven't used in years. In every one, I had to wiggle the plug around in the jack in order to get sound in both ears; the right ear speaker would drop out at the slightest movement.

At first I thought perhaps just one pair of the two I bought was at fault, so the pair I took to work I tested on: my work computer, my iPod nano again, my Android phone again, a coworker's iPod classic, another coworker's iPhone, and even an old Sony Walkman I've had in my desk at work for ten years (had to change the battery to even test it). And found the same problem: have to wiggle the plug to get sound in both ears.

Then just to be sure, I switched the home pair for the work pair and ran both tests again. Same result.

If you're buying these for use with a non-stereo audio source, they should work fine. If you want stereo, though, get something else.",I don't think the plug is in spec

The base is clean, nice and low but i noticed it does not get really loud so you will need to really turn up the volume from your listening source really high to compensate.

I prefer this style of headphone for running, where earbuds often work their way out (via movement, sweat, or both) and become terribly uncomfortable. Because Sony discontinued their headphones, I have been looking for equivalent, inexpensive headphones for running.
I have previously purchased various other brand headphones to try to find a replacement, but none were comparable. Some had terrible (and quiet) sound, some had uncomfortable bands, some broke, some had poor cords (""straight"" plugs vs 90 degree angle, single cords that swung to one side, long cords that dragged the ground due to length, etc.).

FINALLY, found a great replacement. These headphones have the best sound of any of the 8+ headphones I've tried in the past...and not just passable sound, but GOOD sound. Also, they are rugged and good fitting with a solid, but not tight band. The 90 degree plug-in end is preferred, and the cord is not too long or too short (probably about 40 inches or so). To top it off, they are very inexpensive.

Was this review helpful to you?, October 22 2010,Panasonic On-Ear Stereo Headphones RP-HT21 (Black & Silver)...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As an avid music listener, I find that a good pair of headphones is extremely important. My last pair was breaking down and I knew I needed a new one, but I didn't have that much money. So, I was browsing around Amazon and found this.

Absolutely FANTASTIC. I was skeptic at first, being only 4 dollars and with free shipping. I was flat out wrong on that assumption; the sound quality is great, with especially good bass. The cord length was a tad shorter than I would have liked, but it got the job done. I haven't had a chance to test durability, but it seems to hold okay. Wouldn't stake my life on it though.

They're very modest in design; not too flashy, yet they don't look tacky either. They were surprisingly comfortable, especially because I have sensitive ears. They were also very easy to use and completely operational from time of purchase.

All in all, a 4/5, and a steal at the price. Spring on it while you can people!",Fantastic buy.

The bass is incredible, the sound response. Here is what I did, I decided, since all of these cheap headsets get ok ratings I only purchased four star ones. I got five different kinds, this one stands out, no questions, hands down, major winner. I plan to buy three pairs and just forget about it. If I break them, misplace them, give them away, whatever, I'm covered. You can't go wrong. I use them for running and the long cord is great, no issues. Sure they get a little sweaty but I can hear the oncoming slaughter (unlike in ear headphones), the bass is great, my ears are not sore.

Up until now I had been listening to MP3's on my Blackberry and another MP3 player on ""ear bud"" type headphones. The sound quality of these Panasonic headphone is far and away superior to those devices. I'm a fan of Hot Tuna , a band with a great variety of music including a distinct bass guitar line. Well, I'll tell you I can finally hear the bass the way it is meant to be heard. I know this is only after less than a day of service but I don't often review my Amazon buys and this one really deserved a positive mention. If my opinion changes over time I'll write an update so if you don't hear from me assume my current rating remains. I really think that for the price they're unbeatable!",Superior Sound!!

They've lasted me quite awhile and still have not broken or gone out. Even if they do, the replacement cost is excellent. I bought a pair for my daughter as well and she loves them.
The one bad thing is they don't fit on my cellphone jack with my Otterbox case on it, so I have to remove the case when I work out. Small inconvenience.
