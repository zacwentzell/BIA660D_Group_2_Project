0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for workouts and yardwork, and can honestly say it gets the job done. They stay in my ear with no problems, and have great sound quality. I was actually amazed at how good everything sounded, they sound as good as my Klipsch S6i - which at the time of writing cost around $60. Pairing to my phone is a breeze, and I find that the battery lasts a very long time before needing to be recharged. The wire connecting the headphones is flat, which from my experience means that it is alot less prone to being tangled that ordinary headphones. All in all, I am happy with the purchase, and would not hesitate to buy another pair."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. I really like that they speak when you turn them on and off. They were very easy to pair , and the connection seems solid.I did leave my phone on a table and walked around 20-30 fet away and still had music. The bass on these is not too deep but, my music did not have deep bass to it. I was able to use the earpiece that came installed and they were quite comfortable. I have worn them during some semi vigorous activity and they stayed in place with no problems."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Massachusetts is planning on going Handsfree for cell phones. So, I think these might be an alternative. When I saw them I thought what a great way for not losing the ear bud it's attached for both ears. Gonna have to read the laws on driving with head phones. Most states it's frowned upon. But, to use the tread mill or to go outside or the track for a walk it would really be a great idea. I can leave my phone in my car An set the blue tooth for the ear buds."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable with three sets of replaceable ear plugs. Works great with my iPhone and Mac pro.
Like the control for volume and track. Hard cover case provides good protection and easy to carry."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly use these headphones for working out. Sound is excellent, Bluetooth is flawless - including call clarity the few times I've used it - and they seem to hold a charge for the stated 8-9 hours of continuous play. Save some $$$ and get these!

Update: These started acting odd - disconnecting from Bluetooth and then shutting down - after about a month of use. Seemed to happen most when working out, possibly a moisture issue as normal function returned after a day or two. Now, two months into use, they refuse to connect to my phone or other Bluetooth devices at all. I've contacted Otium about a replacement. Will update when I hear back."
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice headphone. It can active a music so well. I also like the appearance of this device！
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a compact Bluetooth in-ear headphone with cyber look design. It totally surprised me with its audio quality for small body at this such price. Comparing to my Bose QC 35, It definitely is not at the same sound quality level, but considering a fifteenth price, it will win."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones, the signal is strong so that i can listen to music with no issues with my phone being across the room and had no issues with dropped signals. They have great balanced sound with nice but not overpowering bass and feel quite comfortable while wearing them. The design is nice and won't fall when moving so these are decent headphones for jogging. this is a great deal for 24$ as these have outperformed 60/70$ headphones in terms of quality. Good buy"
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these headphones. After looking through many other headphones and their reviews, I chose to purchase this pair. It seemed like a great deal price to performance wise. The headphones had quality sound and were comfortable.

Now, fast forward to 3 months later. The headphones worked fine until one day at the gym. The right side of the headphones stopped working. The sound went in and out for a while until it immediately ceased to work. I put the headphones in a bowl of rice to see if it was due to sweat seeping in, but isn’t that why they’re IPX7? After a night in the grains, nothing changed. I thought these headphones were the one, but now I’m stuck with listening to only leftsided audio. I’m very disappointed.

Thank you for your time."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I had another cheap pair of wireless headphones but those blow those out of the water! I love the sound and how you can control your music from the ear piece. I don't have a problem with these slipping off or anything as they fit secure around my ears. I've been using these at the gym for about 2 months now & I really love them. Definitely recommend!
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are quite nice. The tips are very soft in the ear and fit comfortably. The hooks are a bit large for my ears, but they stay snugly on my head when I'm moving around. It was very easy to pair and the controls are pretty straightforward. Volume levels were good; they can get surprisingly loud if you want them to. The case is quite nice and feels very sturdy. Definitely a good thing to have when traveling. Plus it comes with a 1 year warranty which is really nice.

As for the sound, they have a strong bass emphasis similar to Beats headphones. I prefer a flatter EQ personally, but I was able to tweak the EQ in spotify and other apps to get a flatter response. If you like Beats then you'll definitely like these. Kick drums and bass are very forward in the mix and if you're listening to podcasts then the voices will be a bit more boomy than you may be used to. Again, adjust the EQ if you have that option and want a flatter sound."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great set of headphones! I am really happy that I got them. They are very comfortable, and fit over my ears great. It also included extra buds, but these were great. They connected to my android phone really easy, and they came pretty well charged. They seem well made, and I foresee them lasting a long time!"
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This si awesome. Sound quality is really good. I love bass and one of the factors for me when I buy a pair of headphone is if you can hear the bass or feel it. You can definitely hear and feel the bass a little. I literally got these therefore I'll do an updated review later when I test battery life etc. I work midnights and with the movements etc. of what I do when I work. I am confident that these will last a long time. So far a definently buy if your looking for headphones. I'll update this review tomorrow. If anything crazy happens with the headphones you'll know.
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for 6 weeks and they just stopped working. Of course, they broke 20 days after they couldn't be returned. They are an absolute rip off. Do not waste your money. Now I have to find a new set."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so easy to use. Just turn on the earbud and the Bluetooth on your phone and connect. Sound quality is great, does not slip off the ears. The box also comes with three replicable earbuds, a charger, and a manual. Thumbs up!"
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars," First of all, I have to commend the seller for extremely fast delivery. I am pleased with this aspect. The package came in perfect condition, and the set up for these earphones are so simple. I would say it took me no less than 3 mins to actually connect the bluetooth to my phone and use it immediately. They come in the cutest little carrying case, with a keychain hook that you can connect to your belt or keys or hydroflask for when you're at the gym. I listened to the quality and they are crisp and clear, and the bass filled my ears perfectly. There's also a mic on the earphones, so this is a way better deal than spending $200 on iPhone wireless earpods. It fits my ears well, and if my boyfriend wants to use it, he can switch out the ear padding to fit his ear size and vice versa. It's comfortable, so that's a huge reason I got these. Definitely recommend to those college students trying to save money on wireless earphones!"
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek and modern headphones fit snugly around my ears, and I can mold the plastic slightly in order to make them fit my ear better - which is nice. I really like the red color and feel that they stand out while I'm taking a walk or run.

The sound quality of these earbuds are nice, and I love that I can hook it up to my phone and use it around the house, or while I'm out. The cord is a really good material and feels soft and sleek to the touch. Charging these earbuds is pretty painless as well, and doesn't take a lot of time! They also come in a cool zipper container that protects them in my bag!I highly recommend these!"
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a late adopter when it comes to the wireless/blue tooth game. This is due mainly to the reports on battery life, and loss of signal while listening to music/podcasts etc., from personal sources and forums. The sound of this product is sufficient for most genres of music. This product seems to have an issue with really intricate metal, however it still sounds better than most in ear headphones. Your more mainstream genres such as Classical, Jazz, POP, Electro, Rock, Country, R&B, Hip Hop, et cetera sound great. I purchased these during a flash sale for 16.00 USD. Definitely worth your money. I will update when the battery life starts to dissipate so that future consumers will be made aware of the average product life."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this as an ""Employee of the Month"" gift for my company. When I got it, I had to test it out, and I gotta say, it works very well. Charges fast, easy to install onto your device (I used my iPhone) and the sound quality is pretty good. It's no Bose or Sennheiser level of quality, but it'll hold it's own against a pair of Skullcandy earbuds. You're also not paying Bose level prices either - hence the gift idea. I figure 25 bucks a month is worth it if my productivity increases.

But now I'm considering keeping them and getting something else for a gift. We'll see."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good Bluetooth headphones with one exception that almost made me return them. The bass, arghhh the base is way out of proportion. Please stop with the over emphasis on this one component of music, what is it with everyone jumping on the over use of bass in their music. Bass is one of many components that make music beautiful and it plays an important part yes but it is not the holy grail. At first I could barely make out the vocals and other instruments due to the extreme bass incorporated into this product. I was about to return them hoping to find a more balanced set of headphones. BUT then I remembered oh ya they make equalizers just for this very purpose. To fine tune the listening experience to your satisfaction. Since these will only ever be used (in my case) with a smartphone or iPAD this was a simple fix. Now my music is almost just how I want it. I’ll be tweaking the sound for a little longer until I get it just right. Don’t be afraid of equalizers if you have never used one. Don’t panic take a screenshot of the initial settings for reference and then just dive in and play with all the sliders, you will know when you have come close to your preferred setting, problem solved.

OK NOW THE GOOD! These feel really good on my earlobes and in my ears, just really comfortable. Even without music on these block what I think is a good amount of distracting noise. There are many Bluetooth headphones that are very similar to these but these had a slight style advantage over most that I came across. The price was reasonable and the construction feels very solid. The buttons are all in the right place and easy to identify. I like the silicone cord tightening piece, I don’t like things dangling near around my head very distracting and I inevitably get the cord caught on something and yank my headphones right out of my ears...aggravating. These are also very loud when set to the upper settings, I don’t advise it, seriously a bad idea and the music gets very distorted at the uppermost range. But I have to admit I do like the freedom to destroy my ears if I want too. Too much product nannying going on these days, I cry FREEDOM! Ok that’s a bit extreme but the point is made.

For the price I think these are hard to beat, I did a lot of researching because I am insane enough to drive myself loony comparing devices, options available, reviews and style within a price range that doesn’t send me into and obsessive compulsive spiral to keep them perfect.... believe me you don’t ever wanna know what that’s like.

To sum it up these are a very good choice in my opinion, only time will tell. You should certainly pay the $20 admission fee to try them out. Download a high rated free equalizer app that doesn’t demand permissions the app has absolutely no reasonable explanation for needing. Happy Listening 👂!"

1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had no trouble pairing these to my iPhone and they work great! Sound is amazing, totally able to drown out my annoying coworkers and their terrible gossip. I even recommended them to my mother -in-law for her books on audio, and she too loves them."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are EXCELLENT. I have them and use them for my laptops, phone, etc. Not only are they for listening, but they are also to use on the cell phone as well to talk to , etc, which I did not know. A big bonus. They charge fast and the charge last a long time as well. EXCELLENT price for the product!"

5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This earphone is easy to operate, and in any noisy place, the sound quality is good, easy to carry, running or walking, any time, is worth having"
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome so far. The sound quality is very nice and the Bluetooth capability has been great. Only had them a couple weeks now but no issues so far. I walked about 15 feet away from my iPod at the gym and had no issue keeping connected. And the flexibility of the rubber ear grips make them easy to fit around my ears. My old, stiff headphones used to fall out of my ear but these don't move at all."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality has distortion and subtle disruptions when playing music. I still don't understand why people have reviewed this product as 4/5 stars? I believe they are fake reviews. I do not encourage anyone to buy it!!!

9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my old Bose sport earbud because the cable was broken, so I decided to tried the wireless one this times. I tried it last nite when I went to the gym, no problem falling down when I was running and the noise cancelling to good too."
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones actually performed beyond my expectations. After a 4 hour workout they were still charged. I continued to use them at least 2 additional hours after l got home from my workout and they were still going strong. The battery lasts along time ,very comfortable. these are a great set of wireless headphones with very good sound quality."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable to wear and the sound is great too! It fit my ear so well, and even when I’m running, it doesn’t bother me at all."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to pair with my Note8. Sound quality was not good. I returned them. Also, the part that goes over the ears was too big and not adjustable."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only have them a week, and so far so good. Crisp sound and loud enough when walking , but when it's very windy, I can hear the wind too much. I will update the review at a later date.

HIGHLY Recomend"
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s very good price for this kind of good quality sound product. easily connects to my phone without the wire. hands free. I don’t need to pick up my phone to answer the incoming call anymore.
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Got these after the original ones were defective so I upgraded to these from the $4 cheaper ones. Use them everyday for my workout. Good sound. Hopefully they continue working well.
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well. I can use it during jogging. Good
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought this for my husband. He use it when he goes to the gym. He likes it so much. It's light weight with good sounds quality. He said it also isolates the outside noice completely, so he can enjoy the music without turning on a high volume. Strongly recommend!"
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the bluetooth headphones. It's very comfortable and very convenient. Before I have it, I am always bothered by the ear plug dropped down from my ears. Now I don't need to worry about that at all. In addition, the sound qualify is very good, too. I enjoy to listen to music with my bluetooth headphones."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I looked at a lot of different sets of bluetooth ear buds and landed on these. I can't speak to the longevity of this set since I've only used them a couple of times however I would be surprised if the more expensive models like Beats sounded better enough to warrant the near $150 extra. Phone calls could be a bit clearer but they perform as advertised. Easy to use controls, music is clear, links easy and stays linked."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,nice quailty！ like it so much! Wireless is so convenient! And it works well with my Bluetooth! I like the color! Red and black! So cool!
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,super loud headphones i love that. the bass is crazy on these but the trade off seems to be that the highs are muffled but still totally worth it
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,I would save my money and purchase a little better brand. I thought this would serve my purpose but they do not last longer than an hour. I use them once and then turn them off. Next time expecting at least two uses before needing to be charged and they are dead....and at the gym...that really sucks when you aren't expecting it. The sound is decent though so that's why two stars.
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has exceeded my expectations by far. They are light, but well-built, and audio quality is good. Bought 2 pairs thinking they would break easily die to wear, but have withstood the constant usage and rough handling. Excellent product."
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Like the quality of head phone. The instruction is clear so I set up easily to enjoy my music. Another thing is the case is great for storage!
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a gift which I bought for my daughter. My daughter likes to have sports in the gym, and she also likes listening to music. With this headsets, she can enjoy the movement while listening to music at the same time. The headphones are simple to operate. The sound quality is very good. And this transport time of goods is soon, it only takes two days for me to get it."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to wear while running, but they kept falling out of my ears. The ear wraps are worthless and serve no purpose. They look like they will grip around the ear, but they do nothing because the loops are way too large. I am returning these for something that wraps over the ear and snug around the back of the head."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality. Stay in place and they're comfortable. Quick to connect. The loop part is a little big. I wish it was adjustable.
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick to charge and holds charge for several hours. Sound is awesome and they are extremely comfortable. Comes with convenient carrying case and extra ear bud covers. Great price for quality product! Will certainly purchase again.

2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, it’s been over a two weeks and they still work. Nothing is broken and the sound is clear."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap, but they feel that way too. I can hear a noise when running like something rattling inside"
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best, cheap Bluetooth headphones out there. Wife likes them. Battery lasts for a while."
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader who enjoys listening to audiobooks to distract me from the daily drudgery of housework. Toting around devices with corded headphones/earbuds is a pain. Plus, not everyone wants to hear what I am listening to, so wireless is the way to go"
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my uncle,and he is a Uber driver, so he can use this pick up phone call or listen to the GPS which is keep quite inside the car. He loves it"
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a little bit of an audiophile and a gym junkie in the works. I do a lot of different workouts that include running/springs/HIIT/etc. These do an amazing job of staying in place and I have had zero issues with sound skipping. I actually was running lines today at the gym so I took my phone out of my pocket and put it on the ground and my signal never cut out, I was running between 5 - 35 feet away from my phone and it was crystal clear the whole time! The sound quality is also up there with some mid-level headphones I have owned. Not quite the quality of a Shure IEM, but much better than anything you can get at this price range and better than some I've had in the $30-$50 range. I've had them for around a month now and will update if anything changes, but these have been nothing short of awesome since day one. I also got four solid 1 - 1.5 hour workouts without needing to charge and actually never got a low battery signal even prior to charging."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,These are better quality than I was expecting with them being pretty inexpensive. Mine came with a zippy case that wasn't mentioned in the description which is nice for storing them when not using.
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, comfortable earhook will not let you lose it in strenuous exercise,"
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this bluetooth because I do need to listen to podcasts and need answering calls hand free throughout the day. (Not for workout) I have to agree that it is indeed a good headset, the quality is great. But it is not perfect. While your not listening to music or talking on the phone, it keeps playing a message saying your bluetooth is connected. Also, while I'm in a phone call it does disconnect at LEAST once and I have to turn it on again. The range is pretty great while listening to music. Unfortunately as I had read previously in other reviews it is a bit of a weird fit in your ears. I dont know why, I guess its common to have different ear sizes and etc, it just doesn't fit right and feels weird.. wish it had a better fit but still, it works great for the price. Would I purchase it again? Probably not, I would try a different one, maybe even stay with this brand but a different model would probably fit better."

0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great so far. Got these to replace another set we got that was not working too good. These are great!

Edited: These are actually not good for having calls outdoors for example on the train, bus or just walking on the streets because it picks up all the noise and the person could hardly hear you but they hear all the background noises clearly. I also sent voice notes to my friend and she could not hear me, only the background noise then when I replayed them I couldn't hear me either.

This sucks because this is the second set of bluetooth headphones I got that are no good."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this for about two months.

It's ok sound quality is what you expect for the price.

The problem is...today the buttons to increase volume and skip songs...the button is stuck, so now my earbuds are playing full blast and I can't skip songs.

Avoid the product."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't found any earbuds that stay in my ears. These stay in my ears. The loop is painless and doesn't feel uncomfortable, and allows me total freedom while I listen to anything on my phone."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just finished using these headphones on a four hour road trip. Amazing sound! Crisp and clear with just the right amount of bass. Still going strong at the end of my trip. Very comfortable to wear. Was easy to pair with my phone in just seconds. Come in a very handy carrying case with a nice carabiner you can clip to your pack. Also come with two other pairs of different sized ear buds, although the ones originally on the heaphones fit me perfectly. Compared to other Bluetooth headphones I looked at, these are a great value!"
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless head phone is very light. The ear plug is soft and doesn't not hurt the eardrum area even after long use time. I really like the base sound of it. The Bluetooth connection range just s great too. It doesn't disconnect even I am 10 feet away from my phone. Plus the battery last for a good eight hours. Totally worth it first every penny!
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having wireless plugs is so very nice. It's freeing from all the issues you have with cording up to a phone, or other electronic. They are comfortable for ear buds. They stay put when working out, which is a real plus. The over the ear hoops are soft enough not to annoy, or irritate the skin around your ear. They're well made, and come with a handy carrier you can throw in your gym bag or purse. They hold a charge, charge up pretty quickly, which I appreciate a lot. Would buy them again, if I needed to."
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Intermittent issues with the volume key(s) not working since unpacking them. I contacted the seller immediately, who asked for more information. I gave them more information and they said they would be in touch. It's been over a month now and no reply. It's not bad enough to return through amazon (though I imagine i'm past that deadline now anyways), but it's pretty annoying. If that issue were not present I'd probably give these a 4, they do work pretty well in the shower, and the sound quality is good though I'm no audiophile."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to post a quick tip to those that don't want any brands or colors. I was able to black out these headphones by using a plain sharpie. Just go over the headphone brand and color. The sharpie will leave a glossy residue then just use your finger over the glossy residue and the resulting finish matches the flat black rubbery coating of these headphones. The blacked out finish seems to last since I've had the headphones. I also used some black ear buds I had from another headphone.

Overall, I would rate these headphones great. The sound is a bit bass heavy but the sound isolation is amazing as well as how light these are. The only negative I would say about these headphones is the button function. I wish the + and - button function were reversed as it's not intuitive. Another peeve is the voice that states the headphones are on or off. Otherwise, well worth the purchase."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few positives of this product include its easy Bluetooth setup with a cellular device, the sound is extremely clear and precise, and the noise cancellation works well. There is a volume adjustment feature on the headphones which contain one up volume button and one down volume button. The headphones are comfortable on my ears. I feel as if this set of headphones was well worth its price."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, excellent bluetooth connectivity. I could put my phone on the kitchen counter while listening to music and I never had a problem! They are comfortable with a bunch of different size buds to try in your ear.

0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy setup. The price is super good given the quality of this earphone. I also like the case coming with it. I can hang it on my daily bag so the earphone won't get lost.

2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great valued wireless sports ear buds! I bought these over the Black Friday Daily Deal sale. I did not expect much. Yet, am pleasantly surprised once I charged it and put them on. The default ear buds fit perfectly for me. They aren't noise cancelling, but because of the perfect fit, I feel enclosed and away from the grunting meatheads in the gym. It stays charged, for what seems forever (I charge it once a week. I use it 5 days a week for the gym). The range isnt all that great, but just keep your phone in your pocket, and you will be all good.

If you aren't brand specific on ear buds, but these. Excellent stuff."

1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had quite a few different earbuds that I use for running and working out. These are the best ones I've ever had. They stay in place, have great sound quality, and I can move around without the bluetooth skipping or losing contact. I can even listen to my music while casting exercise videos to the TV. Holds a charge well over two hours of use. Very highly recommend to anyone that has an active lifestyle!"
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"these work great on my phone - and thats it. They will not connect to my laptop, tablet, or PC (all Bluetooth compatible) Had for a few months and only tried pairing with my phone (until today), My PC will find the headphones but not pair with them (said it is a driver error) and my laptop cannot even find them when in discovery mode. After these two failures I unpaired it with my phone, repaired it and it works fine. This is a very limited product and I would not purchase again, very unhappy, no more Otium products for me"
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this set best! It connects to my phone spontaneously! ! Unlike my other Bluetooth devices, they would take a few seconds to find and connect. I finally can be hands free while cleaning the house or walking the dogs. I had the wired headphones from Samsung when I purchased my phone. The wire got caught and my phone got dragged out of my pocket and dropped on the ground so many times. Especially my kids, they complained that my phone was being too loud while they try to watch TV. Now, they can mind their own business and I have my own freedom listening to music however I want."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price point you just can’t beat these. The sound is decent if not spectacular and the battery is long lasting. Several hours. If you want heavy bass etc these are not for you but if you want cheap pair that sounds solid then go for it
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for a Christmas gift and after about a month they stopped working, won’t charge. Disappointed as I bought a slightly more basic pair of this brand in June for myself and it’s still working after lots of use."

Dont look further and just buy these now. You wont regret it."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wireless earphone is good for people having an iphone7 or up, like me. You cannot use the regular earphone unless you have a convertor for iphone7 or up. With this wireless earphone, you don't need to care what connection iphone has. Also I usually listen to news at night while I charged my iphone, and I cannot do that with wired earphone. So this earphone is very handy for me. This sound quality is okay considering the price, and especially for people like me only use it for news. By the way, you can connect your iphone to the wireless headphone and apple watch in case you don't know."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have been using it for a while. it can be used for couple hours after fully charged. Not premium sound, obviously couldn't compare to JBL, Bose or Beats but hey, considering the price, I would still give it 5 stars. Very easy to pair with my phone. it works well so far. I would recommend you to buy this if you're looking for a fair price, Bluetooth headphones."

7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Went to workout in these and they felt secure around my ears. The large power button is easy to find even in my bag and while running. Impressed by the sound quality too. Wasn't muffled and gave me a good amount of bass while not overpowering the music. The carrying case is a nice touch too.
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,This is worked properly for the first week but after that its not connecting properly and giving too much noise while talking and hearing the music. battery also draining too fast. probably I might got a defective piece but my experience is bad with this.
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked ok for 2 months and now they won’t connect to anything. I’ve tried 3 different devices and get the same result.
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very good for the price and I am incredibly happy with the product. They come in a small case that has a clip at the top that can fasten it to say a bike or even on a belt loop. They fit very nicely in my ear and haven't fallen off once, even during a workout. The sound quality is fantastic, especially the bass. These babies kick! Another fantastic aspect is the battery life, they last all day for me and more on a single charge! The only reason I have given it a four star review could possibly be own fault, but i can't seem to figure out how to pause/play using the headphones themselves. Other than that i LOVE these things and will probably buy another pair."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have this, I don't know if I can come back to wired headphones!!! They are so convenient to use - especially if you like riding bikes, going to the gym, or doing any other physical activities. They don't get in the way, are easy to charge. and are on sale most of the time."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,The product worked well for the first month but now it doesn't turn on or sync up. I fell bad because I gave it a good review during that month to friends looking for a nice portable Bluetooth headset but I may have been hasty . Now I will have to buy a new headset but I won't be looking at otium audio.
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These bluetooth headphones are amazing, looks nice, well made, very comfortable.

5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is fine but microphone position is very poor (just outside the right ear bud) - does not pick up my voice clearly while using the phone.

6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality. BUT... I’m not really a fan of the earbuds with the ear hooks.

8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs better adjustment for smaller eyes. Fits too loose on smaller ear which means its doesn't work for workouts.

1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for training. Not sure if they are supposed to be noise suppressing but I can’t hear anyone trying to talk to get my attention when I’m working out. Battery life lasts longer than my older pair which was only 3hrs. I sweat like crazy and I’ve had a few sets of headphones for because of moisture getting inside, have had these 3+ months and no issues. However, my phone shows the battery life of the otium beats and sometimes will die when read at half-battery. Only reason for 4 stars."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Do NOT buy these for running. When I wear these running or if there is wind when I'm walking outside it's like listening to your car stereo with the windows down. When running you have to turn the volume way up to hear anything over the wooshing and whistling these make as air moves past them. If you don't plan to run or wear these outside, they are great, comfy, loud, sound good, last a long time, easy to use controls, the cord is stays out of the way even when working out etc, they look pretty good. Being picky but the over the ear peices are a bit big and tall, I don't think you can use these to give Siri commands while your iPhone is in your pocket, that is a feature my old Bluetooth headphones had. For the price these are amazing headphones as long as you don't run or experience any wind. These really seam to amplify any moving air."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst headphones I’ve ever used. Out of the box the sound quality was TERRIBLE. At an average volume a regular song sounded like they were totally blown out when there was any sort of bass. Besides that, they didn’t fit great, the part that hooks over the ear was too big and couldn’t retract so it didn’t serve its purpose of keeping them on my ear. The main round button that controls just about every function is in the worst possible place because if you try to adjust them while you’re working out (you will have to because they fit so terribly) you inevitably hit the button every. single. time. Overall they were terrible and I returned them after the first use."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very dissapointed as they don’t fit my kids ears and I need to return 2 pairs but the return date expired! I ordered them for Christmas and now can’t return them? Hopefully we can make it right somehow!
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if I got a bad one or not. But every time I put my phone in The inside of my wool coat pocket. The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting! We're talking about a foot difference of distance. Then I have a problem , when I have for example my navigation program on or software I should say, it only gives me part of the beginning words every time it speaks. I'd like the idea that it's Bluetooth and fits well around my ears. It had so many good reviews I thought these were it. The options for music playing,stopping, answer phone calls is great. I think, I received a bad one or batch--is my only rational explanation aside from it being junk. Anyways, this is my experience. H"
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Connecting it via bluetooth was relatively easy. But I think the speakers are of low-quality. Bass is heavily muddled and sound as if speakers are cracked, even at low volume. I am using this with iPhone 7 and my Apple earphones sound far better than these. I tried to reset the connection as it looks like that was suggested to another buyer but still same problem. Bass sound similar to low-quality airplane headsets. A personal preference issue with this unit is that you have to hold down the up/down volume for 3 seconds to skip or reverse a track. This is fairly cumbersome when using the unit during runs.

Overall very disappointing but I guess you get what you pay for."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice for the price, great range; however, don't try riding a bicycle with them on...they do not block noise at all...real bummer too."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem to be well built and crafted. However, I just cannot sacrifice sound quality to this extent. My numerous pairs of wired earbuds produce much better fidelity. These bring a very muddied listening experience. Vocals such as podcasts are difficult to discern to the point of frustration even with bass reduction settings. Could be an acceptable, even good product for some, but for me the distortion was just too much. In the drawer they go for use in a pinch only. A disappointment."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is really bad, waaaay too much bass, so much that even if you listen at a low volume it hurts your ears, and I love rock and rap.
BT connection gets jumpy if you put the phone in your pocket! I had to skate with the phone in my hand to listen to music without interruption.
I bought it and came to my country, so I won't be able to return it, I'm completely disappointed with this product."
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a lot that I like about these headphones and just a few that I don't.
They produce a nice loud quality sound, easy to connect, listen to music, answer calls but for my small head, the headphone earpiece does not fit as well as I'd hope for. They are fairly comfortable, I wore them for a few hours while doing housework and then went out into the yard and watered my plants. I did have to use the supplied headphone ""clip"" to shorten the length of the cable. I ended up putting my hair in a bun so that it didn't tug on the cord. I lose reception a few times but you can move about freely for quite a distance. If I had tried them on at the store, I probably wouldn't buy them because of the ear length piece but for someone with a larger head, perhaps they would be great for a man."
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I only used for a week while I waited for my beats 3 to be fixed from Apple. These are great.. cheap and the sound is loud. Not as clear but the volume makes up for it. I'm happy to have these!
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So my headphones came in earlier today. I've used them for a couple of hours so far and they are pretty awesome for the price. Way better than the wired headphones that came with my s8. They paired with my phone easy, the sound quality is great, and they do kins of block out outside noise. They are lightweight and fit my ears good and Don't make them sore. Walked through my house farther than 30 ft. And even closed a door and they still pick up. Don't know of they are water resistant yet, I haven't sweated or took a shower with them on like the product clams you can do. It comes with a 1 year warranty, and I registered online and got an 6 month extended warranty. So far I'm very pleased with them."

5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. I use it to listen to music when I’m running. Look very similar to my husband beats and I personally think they work about the same. So much cheaper. Like that it’s wireless
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use bought this headphone for workouts . They stay in my ear with no problems, and have great sound quality. I was actually amazed at how good everything sounded, they sound as good as my beats headphone. I find that the battery lasts a very long time before needing to be recharged. The wire connecting the headphones is flat."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. I use these during my runs and while working out. I don’t use the talking feature because people say that I sound far away. But that’s not why I purchased them. Great set that stays in place and feels light weight on my ears so 5 starts from me. I even ordered my husband a pair and he loves them too.
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,My 15 year old son loves these. He broke his first pair somehow and wanted the exact same pair again. He paid for the second pair himself for not taking care of the first ones.
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice look, but the Bluetooth connection is not good at all. Cannot hear music or calls very well because of the bad connection."
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing headphones! They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn! They sit perfectly on my ear and feel like they can be worn for hours without discomfort! The sound quality is unparalleled! These sounds just as good as my friend's ""beats"" that we're over $150! They come with a perfect size carrying case as well. They are light weight on your ears and have the perfect length cord. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a sweat proof high quality superior sound wireless headphones!"
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these bluetooth earbud-type headphones! I love music, but am not super picky about sound in headphones, but these sound great! They stay on my ears and it is so nice to not have a cord in the way, this is my first pair of bluetooth headphones. I bought 5 pair of these as gifts, as well as my pair. So far, everyone is happy with the gift. They connect very easily to our phones, all iPhones. I've also paired them to my MacBook and iMac. I would highly recommend these for sound quality and ease of use!"
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These WILL NOT stay in ears, no matter which ear buds are used. Completely useless for running, since they require me to hold them in my ears the entire time. Wish I had chosen to spend more money for a higher quality product."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are not ""noise cancelling"" as listed in the description; they are sound-isolating in that they behave like ear plugs with speakers, rather than actively removing background noise as the description implies. If you are looking to buy these as a ""noise cancelling headset"" (like a Bose headset) you will want to look elsewhere.

That said, as a basic bluetooth headset, these aren't bad. The ear clips are a little flimsy and don't provide a positive feel for being held in, rather they are just to keep the earpiece from falling to the ground when (not if) the friction fit of the earbud gives way. A stiffer material would go a long way in this area.
Sound quality is good, bass is more pronounced than typical of a small speaker like this. Mids and highs are a little muted/muddy, but can typically be compensated for with the music app of your choice (or a sound equalizer app).

All in all - I wouldn't purchase these again at full price, but as a lightning deal they are a decent set of bluetooth earbuds. There are much better available in the price range."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are OK ONLY because the ear wraps are way too flimsy. If the ear wrap were more sturdy then Id have given this a 5 star. The ear wraps are designed to keep the pods in your ear, but these are so loose that the pods often wiggle out causing you to continue to press the pods back in your ears. If the ear wraps were sturdy enough to actually press the pods into your ears slightly this product would definitely be a five, but as it stands it's only ok, especially for someone with larger ears."
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just picked these up on a cyber monday lightning deal. Very happy - only took a star off because it's not perfect.

Pros:
Great price for the sound quality
They are LOUD - very freaking loud. I'm actually going hard in the paint right now with these on.
Good design, stays on my ears
Comfortable for long wear
Easy to pair
1 year warranty from the company
Little carry case that I may or may not use

Cons:
Wire is a little long for my liking - however it doesn't bounce around and fly everywhere. Overall, I would definitely recommend these headphones. Especially at the price.

Summary: The sound is actually phenomenal - it exceeded my expectations. High quality across the board - good bass as well. The headphones are comfy but the only complaint I have is that it's just too much extra wire hanging from the back. Wish the wire was a few inches shorter because there is no reason for the extra slack in the back - nobody has a head that big."
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,When I first bought the this wireless (Bluetooth) headphones I was skeptical because of two reasons. Losing connection/the music cutting out and the quality of the sound. But after using the headphones I was pleasantly surprised. Not once did the music cut out or I have to reconnect and the quality is top of the line. On top of this the buds did not fall out of my ear once and not having to worry about the cords getting in the way is awesome. I highly recommend the product.
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used it for 2 days, but only charged once. Nice battery life. I love the design of 3 buttons control everything. Power button easy to press to answer the calls. And the button is well hidden as the icon. I didn't find it first time hands on it. Volume buttons are able to control the volume and next songs for android phone apps.

Love this headphone while sporting and in the car."
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for 3 weeks now. Very much as described. Last more than a full day of work with music (over 8 hours) and charge in the 1.5 hours as described. Took a few days for me to find a comfortable fit angle, but once found they are very comfortable and secure, though probably not wedged in deep enough for full noise cancelling. Fully inserted they were just not comfortable to my ear shape/size, but I wouldn't expect everyone to have a perfect fit.

I've done two mile runs with zero jiggle or fear of falling out. Sound clarity is way above what the cost is. The Bass is maybe not as deep as they describe, but still plenty. Overall they sound great and un-muddled.

One issue I've had is wind noise. I think this has to do with the wire being towards the front of the ear piece. That said, it's not that much and I just crank up the volume a bit more than in a non-wind situation.

The only other issue I've had is that when using two devices, one tends to completely dominate. This may be more to do with setting on my devices though than the headphones and not really a huge deal.

You can't go wrong on this purchase at this price."
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are awesome. Great sound quality. Crystal clear. Exactly as described and what I expected. Very comfortable. Doesn't make your ears sore. My kids love them. Easy to set up Bluetooth and connect to your phone. Very good quality and very durable! Highly recommended! Would definitely purchase again!
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars," These heads phones work well in the respect that they connect to your phone easily and they sound.....pretty good for the money. However I'm an audiophile, I actually mix tracks for a living so I don't know how I ever thought that these headphones which were on sale for like 16 bucks on sale...normally like 27 were going to live up to my demands. I guess I just couldn't pass up a smokin deal. That and I trusted the majority of the reviews which said great things about these.

At the end of the day I was seriously concerned about using wireless headphones at all considering how much quality gets lost in the air when you lose the cord with headphones, let alone when dealing with cheaper ones. Now...let me just say ...I am knocking these headphones...but considering they were as cheap as they were, I almost feel guilty about it because back in the day when I was a kid....this kind of quality would have been impossible for this price...if at all. So it's cool to think about how far we've come.

But as my video review says..overall they're 7 out of 10. The sound is actually surprisingly good...and they do get loud...so you can push them a bit. But the sound does start to come apart. There's not much low end bass...so whoever made them tries to make up for that with some high bass that sounds kinda cardboardish sounding. Hallow you could say...right about 300 HZ which I tried to EQ out with my phone to get them to sound better. It kinda worked but not altogether and they still left me wanting more. Much more.

Do they work well enough for an hour at the gym for 16 bucks..yes. Am I surprised at the sound....yes....amazed..NO! But am I amazed at how much you can get for 16 bucks all in?...yes. But here is the real question that matters. Will I ALWAYS be thinking to myself about how much I wish I had a better pair while I'm wearing them. HELL YES.

With that being said,...I think this is one of those situations where you actually get more than you pay for...but even saying that...they still aren't up to the standards of what I would expect with a rockin pair of bluetooth headphones. So I wouldn't buy again...unless I just wanted a throw away pair of blue tooth headphones.

Regards!"
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for long lasting (battery) headphones for work. I work overnight & I had trouble finding headphones that would actually last 8 hours in one charge. I came across this product & let me tell you, it’s great. The headphones are comfortable & the battery life is more than I expected. In one single charge I got 11 hours on a moderate volume level. Really easy to connect to phone. They come with a nice case that fits the headphones, charger cable & the ear bud replacements. The sound quality cannot be compare to jbl, beat or apple headphones but it’s not awful. Only complain would be that usually around 20% charge you get the notification the battery life is low. Instead of just one simple noticed, the notification keeps repeating itself again & again (voice notification) which can get a little annoying specially if you hear it the first time. They also come with a 6 month free warranty in case anything goes wrong with the product. You need to register on their website (easy process) & can be helpful since you get updates & if you want to purchase or extend your warranty you can do it online. Overall I’m happy with this headphones & I would buy again.

Pros:
-Long lasting battery life
-Comfortable
-Water/sweat resistant
-Good looking product
- Free 6 month warranty

Cons
-Low Battery Notification (so far)"
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones feel great on my ears and didnt move around while mowing the lawn. I also used them while riding my motorcycle and they actually stayed in place! They sound great and can get loud enough to hear almost all the time. Love the price and quality. Definitely recommend.
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I been wanting some wireless headphones for forever that 1. Didn't have ""beats"" price tag and 2. Weren't super low. These are great! The only problem I've had with mine so far are sometime when switching from different apps for example from Netflix to Pandora the sounds stops and I have to power down and power back up. The battery life is amazing! For the $16 I paid for them they were well worth the money! They don't fall out my ears and I literally can't hear anything when im wearing these, like I have to take them out my ears when people talk to me at work"
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, They last for hours and the sound is great. They fit in the ear well and there are times when the music stops and I forget I'm wearing them.The reason I giving them 4 stars is because of the controls.They're a little hard to master. I've been using them since Jan 2018 and and it's now the end of March 2018 and I still haven't figured out how to use all the features but I still like them a lot. The quality of the mic when making a call seems to be on the low end but the listening quality is great.

Bottom line-
I would buy them again or recommend them to a friend."
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great for the price. I love them. You have to kind of get them at the right angle to fit in your ear but once you get it your set. The sound it very good. When a call comes in you are able to answer it. I paid about $15 for them and would buy another pair in a second. I love that they are wireless. No more dropping my phone on the ground when I hit the corded headphones by accident.
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was afraid to try the apple wireless earbuds, knowing how easy it would be to lose one or both. These fit in the ear good, are wireless from phone but have a cord to keep the two of them from getting lost. Cord works either in front or behind the neck. Has microphone too. A cool case as well with a small caribiner on it."
7,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work very well. I use them for making and receiving phone calls and they work great. I have bad hearing but have no problem hearing the person on the other end at all and they can hear me as well. No static or distortion. I haven't had anyone who complained or even seemed to notice I was using headphones. They are great so far.
8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfectly fitting over the ear headphones. Great for working out, they don't fall out compared to some of the other ones I've tried. They also came with a case, extra ear bits, and a charger"
9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is real the better choice in bluetooth headphones.It has nice stereo sound and bass sound.Its operating distance is so wide that i can use it in my whole house.Hanging on ears is more comfortable than in ears.
0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the Bluetooth cuts out often and also many callers complain that they can’t hear me well. Sound quality is fine for calls or music but I need dual purpose. Gave it a try for $12 so not really any loss. Will go get Beats or something that is a little higher quality.
1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"great headphone and great sound, it doesn't fall off your ears even jumping around, lasts long, charges well, Extremely pleased with these buds."
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smart design. I can easily connect it to my phone with the Bluetooth. The sound quality is not the best, but it’s worth it for the price."
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted something to take to the gym but didn't want to spend too much. The built and overall quality are ok for the price, they look cost efficient (not to say cheap). What really surprised me was the Bluetooth part, they connect right away, no problems at all at least on my iPhone. The connection is very good, no drops or noise, I tested the range inside my gym leaving my phone on my bag and they worked fine (no walls) for more than 30 feet. I even had my heart rate monitor (Wahoo) connected also all the time while listening music, no problem. I even got phone calls, excellent plus if you don't want to reach for your phone while working out. They fit nice around the ear, I do weight lifting and some cardio (bike or elliptical) so they don't move to much, I don't know if they would be as confortable for a runner, I'm guessing maybe not (be sure to try all tip sizes). I really like them, given the price I would keep the four star rating if they go for more than 1 year of use, which i think the will accomplish easily, but you never know. Then If I like them so much why not give them 5 stars?... Well here is the thing, the sound. They could sound so much better than they do just by setting them to a ""flatter"" response curve, I'll explain my self: It looks like they wanted these to sound heavy on the low end and adjusted them to give more volumen there sacrificing quality (they sound a little distorted). I know they are not audiophile or high quality audio headphones, but if they change the response curve lowering the low end volume they could sound so much better. The high end is there, a little rolled down but that's expected for the price range. The good news is you can use your phone's adjustments or equalizer to tame the low end to your liking which eliminates the distortion. Over all I enjoy my new headphones, the package was cardboard which I like, and they came with 3 different size earplugs. They came with a case, nice addition, but I find it a little too big, I wish it was smaller and the soft kind, nevertheless it is still very convenient."
4,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,My last pair of these broke as the power button failed but I do love these and I love the fact that they will replace them for free if you have any issues-
5,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality, simple to use but they just don’t want to stay in your ear for shit. I tried everything all the different bud sizes it come with I tried rotating it the stay in if you’re stationary or not doing much but if you’re working out these will kill your pump quick. But if you’re on a plane ride these are great. Cancels nearly ALL sound, there was a baby behind me screaming most the plane ride but I didn’t notice till I took my headphones off and asked someone next to me how long has that been going on. So comfortable and good quality for for the active user though."
6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Random disconnecting. After a disconnect/repair unable to adjust volume and it's to loud to use. Like buying a water bucket with holes, better than nothing but equally useless. Stay away."

Lasts really long on one charge, it's responsive to calls and other communication back and forth from my phone.

8,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound quality and deep base these headphones provide.

9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re not going to blow your socks off but these are a great bargain.

0,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine heapdhones. Battery lasts about 7 hrs. However, I need something that lasts longer. The fit s great, the headphones don't fall out. Just dont have a long enough battery for my use."

This has problems connecting to two devices. Doesn't automatically connect. I need to power it on and off or I need to switch on or off the bluetooth on my pc and phone to connect everytime.

Holding charge very well at this point. My only complaint is the in ear fit. I just can't seem to manage a fit that feels snug in that area. The ""sweet spot"" as others have called it.

6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good. The price was great. I'm disappointed with the ear hooks, as they are far too large for my ears. They kind of just flop around above my ears. You would think, since they are so flexible, they they would be smaller.

1,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would compare these to beats, the presentation when I received them was great and it came with a little hard travel case. If you ears are bigger or smaller it comes with different size pads so you can change them which is great! This will make the gym so much easier when listening to music!"
2,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound quality. I love the way they look and they are comfortable to wear. My issues are: the largest soft earbud size still is not large enough to make a snug fit causing me to push them back in repeatedly. The other issue is the ear hook is too flimsy causing me to readjust them a lot. If they had a larger ear bud size and more rigid firm ear hooks I would give better rating
3,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones have been amazing for me. I bought them after my last headphone battery stopped holding a good charge after a few weeks. These headphones have and hold a charge that gets me through my workout and then some.
The sound is clear and the volume level makes me happy. I love music and can get lost in it when I'm listening with these earphones.
Honestly, I'm not a fan of earphones. I prefer headphones, but the fit and feel of these are comfortable. I am happy I bought them.
The case they come in is perfect, small, and solid. Great for keeping them safe when I am done using them and throw them into my purse."

6,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering the high price of high quality wireless headphones such as Beats and Bose, I was skeptical of cheap Beats knock-offs for such a low price but bought a pair anyway. They are amazing!!! They have rich sound from high to low - from beautiful acoustic to deep bass. When used as a wireless headset for phone calls, I've been told my voice comes through the mic loud and clear. And to top it all off, despite their size and appearance, they barely weigh anything and are comfortable for all day wear."

9,"Otium Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Best Sports...",3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones were ok. I got them yesterday the quality was good but today there is buzz sound whenever there is more than one instrument. The distance is good you can be quite far and still be able to listen to music or whatever. The headphones are really loud I usually use volume around 7-9 but for this headphones max I went is 5. You don’t expect it to sound great when the prIce is this low. You get what you paid for. I just hope these headphones last more than 3 months cause from my 2 day experience I’m expecting it to last at most month and a half. I’m hoping it last 3 months or more
