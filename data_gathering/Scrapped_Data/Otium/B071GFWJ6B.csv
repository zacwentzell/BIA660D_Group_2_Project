0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars," This Otium X6 have amazing sound so clear even if it's low and high frequency and the quality is perfect. It's easy to use and fits perfectly. It includes different size of ear-pods that is great! Battery life takes 9hours, its also water resistant. Really comfortable to wear and the magnetic also helps the earphone will not fall when doing some exercise like jogging and running. I also use this on our television since I have a Bluetooth receiver so to avoid noise when somebody sleeping at night."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very lightweight headphones, sound quality is clear and loud, headphones feel secured in the ear, no problem running or exorcizing while wearing them. Easy to pair, and microphone works great for handsfree. Great deal for the price"
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this bluetooth headphones for several days, and it meets all my needs.
Pros:
* It's equipped with wings which prevent the earphone from falling out of your ear.
*The sound quality is good enough at this price. I think it is at least as good as Apple's earpods (Not airpods, I don't have it...)
*Details of the earphones is perfect. Their factory does better job in the earphones' exterior than Bose. (Shame on Bose!)
Cons:
* I haven't tested it's battery life. It definitely can't last 24 hours (which Apple said they can). My estimation is about 7 to 8 hours.
*It is not completely water-resistant. The seller says it is sweat-proof which means it is safe with only a few water. It is Ok to me. I will not wear it while taking shower or swimming, but someone may.

Conclusion:
If you're look for a cost-effective wireless headphones, here it is. With 80% less price, you get 80% performance comparing to other famous brands' earphones."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars," I have had these headphones for a few days now and really love them. They are great for my active lifestyle. I have used them whil running, biking, lifting weights, and mowing the lawn. They have stayed in place perfectly.
They are comfortable and lightweight. They also pair very easily with my iPhone and sound great. I would strongly recommend."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This was my first time switching from wired headphones to wireless headphones since I have been listening to music via Iphone or Ipod. I wasn't really sure what to think since it was new to me but these headphones gave me a good opinion. They were very comfortable to wear and they fit inside the ear nicely. I wasn't sure how I would feel about something resting on me but it didn't bother me at all. The only con I had was that the part of the headphone on the cord with the power buttons and volume became a bit annoying as it sits on the back of my neck and was harder to access. Pairing the headphones was a breeze and have a pretty good battery life Overall sound quality was great. It was not dull or faded but sounds crisp and clean. I enjoyed these while I was working out and they never fell out or had any issues at all. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of wireless headphones.
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price you can't beat these Bluetooth neckband style earbuds. I have a few different brands of this style of headset. This one is by far the most comfortable. Many have an issue where the earbuds will fall out when you turn your head...these have long enough wires from neck and to earbuds that they do not pull out. They also connect to each other via magnets in the earbud portion.

The sound was good, but initial sound quality left a little bit to be desired on the bass end, but was certainly adequate at this price point. Connection was easy and quick with my phone and never dropped the signal throughout my use. I expect the sound to improve after a break in period.

I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a necband style headset."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphone for running or doing other exercises! The design of it is perfect so it won't fall down when doing exercises. After charing, this headphone can almost last for three days for normal use."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. I can't even tell I have them on. Very lightweight, great sound, and an unbelievable price! I'm going to get a couple more pairs to give to my parents as gifts. They love them too."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This might be the Otium's best product yet. The SoundBuds Life model is remarkably well built and looks extremely modern and sleek. The audio, being my biggest concern, is actually very dynamic and clear. The bass, mids and highs are all well balanced and the volume is plenty strong enough. The noise cancellation was surprising.The controls are all intuitive, the construction being superb, so I don't foresee any major damage or part malfunctions. Everything is either encased or sealed. The product is completely worth the cost.Recommend!!"

ABSOLUTELY LOVE
‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíô

Long play time. I played movies on this all day and the battery lasted for 11 plus hours. Plus it‚Äôs Sooooo lightweight, I didn‚Äôt realize how heavy my headset was until I wore this one and saw how light these are. I also never realized My old one pulled on my ears which could possibly be the reason I‚Äôve been getting headaches.

This headset has a Handsfree calling feature and noise canceling is wonderful. Has a remote right on the side that turns up, down, on, off, answer, hang up and lots of other stuff.

Water resistant but I‚Äôm not going to try that but if I accidentally do I‚Äôll let you know.

It‚Äôs really cool that the earbuds have magnets on the ends so when you want to have the headset just hang around your Neck you won‚Äôt loose it. It‚Äôs really nice so you also don‚Äôt accidentally bend over and get your headset in your food and stuff.

They also say it‚Äôs resist to water, but do not put it in water on purpose to test. However if by chance I accidentally do I will let you know.

0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband love listen to music when doing experiment.This wireless headphones is easy to connect and very comfortable!
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Otium X6 was reduced a bit during the Prime Day sale, but it listed all of the qualities of comparible higher-priced bluetooth units, without any unbelievabe claims attached, so I felt it was worth the risk to order a brand I'd never heard of. I am very pleased with the materials and solid construction of this headset. The first unit sent proved to have a glitch in the control button response/funtionality, which unfortunately didn't resolve with extended use. Disclaimer; I haven't used the X6 for taking/making phones calls, since all phone calls do is interupt ones enjoyment of listening to music, sorry). After contacing OtiumDirect, they kindly and promptly provided a replacement X6 headset, which exhibited none of the symptoms of the first unit. The replacement was completely free from glitches and has operatedly flawlessly, so it gets the review. Since other reviewers have added good photos of this unit in their reviews, nothing could be added by duplicating their photography.

The X6 was packed well, in a form fitted plastic insert placed in the outer box, with 3 pair of various sized extra inner ear-tips below the insert, with a USB charging cord, warranty card and tiny manual (too small for me to read). The 'Airwings' hold the earphones in my ear and keep the headphones in the proper direction Although I don't jog or exercise with them, I suspect the 'Airwings' will be useful to those that do. The extra eartips will allow you to have a custom and comfortable fit. After an intial charge, the X6 paired effortlessly with the assistance ofvocal prompts. The magnetic attraction of the earphones keeps them from becoming unduly tangled when you set them aside. In practice, Bluetooth 4.2 definitely seems to have much-improved tonal qualities regardless of volume. The X6 battery life offers around a relistic 4-6 hour playback time, depending on volume used and program/music material. I'm unsure how many button presses for volume and track-changes affects battery life. The audio response of the X6 is amazing, considering it's price, It takes 40-80 hours to break-in a headset, but from the first time they were powered on, I've loved the sound of the X6. I never expected to hear such deep clear bass or crips mid and high range at any volume from a bluetooth set, much less at this price. The reception distance of the X6 is better than other Bluetooth sets I've owned, without any discernable dropout or lag when going from one room to the next. Even with a thin paneled wall between the source and X6, I found no sonic diffence. I've reached listening distances of approximately 35-45 feet from the tablet which should be plenty of range for most users. It doesn't matter which transmission source I use, the X6 receives easily, the exception was an ancient anidroid mini-tablet that kept dropping the signal. I love my closed AKG's for studio use, and my wired SkullCandy takes a close 2nd, but the Otium X6 is now my favorite wireless headset, hands-down. I can't think of a reason to pay more for any similar type of semi-wired/wireless design. Otium also offers completely wireless earpiece models which I'm interested in trying at a future date. Otiumobile.com's website was offline and difficult to reach, but when it was sorted out I was able to properly register the X6 for a longer warranty. The only gripe, was the extremely small lettering in the tiny manual; keep your magnifying glass handy, but at least it was included!

I'm happy to give both the X6 headphones and the distributer, OtiumDirect, an unrestrained 5-Star rating for a great product and for the courteous, prompt customer service thy've provided. I'm not a paid product endorser/reviewer; I always offer my honest opinion. Anyone who enjoys listening to music will enjoy having a set of these headphones, at such a great low price. I hope this review helps fellow Amazonians make good purchasing decisions."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I still really like this headset, but after a couple weeks of use the recharge frequency has gone up. I only get about 1:30 to 2 hours of use between charges.

The headset includes 3 different size adapters to allow them fit comfortably in your ears. The headset is very light weight and I hardly noticed I was wearing them after a few minutes. The sound quality is excellent playing back clear high frequency and speech as well as great quality low frequency at low and high volumes. Unlike the ""Otium Best Wireless Sports Earphones"" that I also tested, these do not distort at high volume and delivers a clean crisp sound.

Although the booklet does not state this, the headset can pair to 2 devices at a time and it easily paired to my Pixel XL & Samsung S7 at the same time. If you receive an incoming while listening to music on your phone the music is paused and you get a notification played back for the incoming call as well as the calling number being read back to you. With the headset connected to my laptop and was able to use it for music as well as the audio device and microphone when making calls from the Skype for Business client.

The Bluetooth range on these are slightly better than the other model I tested, the booklet says 10 meters, but I was able to get about 20 meters away before losing audio. The box says sweat proof, but unlike the other model it does not state that it is waterproof in the booklet.

I am extremely impressed with this headset, very comfortable, easy to use excellent sound quality."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely comfortable right out of the box. I use these almost exclusively for the gym, and they're perfect for that. The headset itself is light in weight . The magnets built into the earbuds are pretty strong and have no problem staying together and keeping them around your neck when not in use. Please note, that the instructions say to hold the button for 1 second to turn them on, but for me, it was closer to 5 seconds. Calls are clear and people have no problems hearing me. So far battery life is excellent but this will totally vary on how you use these. I use for music maybe 2 hours a day and hours of phone calls. Right now i charge every other night regardless. These are really great for the price range and extremely easy to use and sync. I'm sure the sound isn't as great as more expensive ones, but for walking, jogging and working out, they get the job done, don't look bad, and fit well.
Above all, these are really good for the money, and I'd rebuy if they broke."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: sadly after about a the audio out of the right earbud stopped working after about 2 months. Should've gone with the BeatsX I guess üôÅ

Just got these last week but I think I FINALLY found the perfect balance of quality Bluetooth headphones with a slim neckband and magnetic earbuds. After literally about 8 to 10 cheapish headphones I was really considering coughing up the $100 - $150 for some BeatsX (Depending on if I could catch them on sale). Just happened to come across these - which have a very BeatsX ""inspired"" design at a much more reasonable price. The main difference I can see us if course these don't have Apple's fancy new chip (w2 I think they call it) that connects to icloud and pair instantly with iOS devices. Oh yeah and these don't charge with a lightning cable. I'm willing to forego those couple of things to save about $125!!! SO glad I came across these. Battery life so far is great. Stylish design. I'm not a crazy audiophile but I'm happy with the sound and they are much better than other similarly priced headphones I've gone through."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Showed up to my door within 1 day of order. I followed the instructions in the box, but Bluetooth did not connect to any device I tried pairing with. I tried an iPhone, ipad, Microsoft surface book, and a galaxy."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless headset from Otium the X6 gave me the freedom to move and it sounds fantastic. I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that's light weight and low profile and most importantly long battery-life. Phone calls are crisp and clear. The mic also works great for me. They also sound great. They will turn off if not used after awhile if not connecting to Bluetooth to save the battery. The ear buds are very countable. They fit my ears perfectly. The magnet is super strong to keep the ear pieces rogether.
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were easy to connect and worked good in a noisy environment.

Turning them way up does seem to not work great for these but even that level was way too loud to be good for you.

Using them as a normal person would =) they worked great.

If you like this design I would suggest trying these."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had these headphones for more than I week and will update my review if my opinion about them changes, or once I test battery life, but for now I can say that these are my favorite pair of headphones! I love headphones and have had several pairs of all kinds, shapes and technologies. The sound quality of these Otium headphones is great for the price and they are very comfortable. I like that the earbuds design keep them from falling off my ears and the location of the microphone allows people to hear me clearly. The controls are very easy to reach and not on the same side as the battery, which keeps the weight balanced. The magnets do a good job at keeping the earbuds together when not in use. At first I thought I would hate these because I don't like things around my neck, but they are so comfortable that I can't even feel that I'm wearing them. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the description is inaccurate. The manual says battery talk/play time around 8 hrs, while description says 10 hrs. Also, nowhere in the manual says that they are sweat proof. It actually tells you to avoid them from getting wet. I'm not sure exactly how long the battery lasts yet, because I haven't used them for many hours straight, but it does last a lot longer than my previous ones. Overall, these are great headphones and very affordable! I will most likely buy more if I don't encounter problems after having using them for some time."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds good, on par with Samsung Level U Pro. Very lightweight. I wanted this one because the wires do not tug on my collared shirts like the Level U does because they have the wires reaching all the way to the back of the neckband. Also the Level U Pro gets my neck warm and sweaty because the battery right there at the back of the neck.

Range is not as good as the Level U Pro, but it's fine with me.
The magnet is very strong, unlike the Level U Pro which the buds keep coming apart.

Highly recommended over anything else."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and sound is great. Work just as well as my wired headphones. Battery life is really good; charged once and still playing after 4-1hr workouts.
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super comfy, even the wings, which I wasn't planning on using, but you can't feel them! Sound good, good range, and more convenient than the retractable ones with a band. And they work while in my pocket (unlike Soundpeats). Love them and the style. Controls are easy to use. Highly recommend."

The neckband is convenient too"
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this headphones for my son. He inmediatly connected to his phone with no problem. Excellent sound easy to connect and carry it around the neck. Unfortunately he lost it a week later so I can't say much.
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wireless neckband-style headphones is extremely light to wear but don‚Äôt lose any of its durability. It comes with soft cushioning ear buds, it is manage to sit comfortably in the ear. When I wear it to run, I barely noticeable and stay secure. Thanks to the well-designed flexible neckband, I love it so much."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for my friend who loves running on the street. It is stable when running and the sound is quite good as well. With this kind of price, this is the best you can get."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them as long as they worked.. 2 months of usage and they stoped working, I think they are not sweat proof, because when I used them it starts beeping like if I was pressing a bottom and music starts changing song from song.."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones worked great for about a month. Now they drop the Bluetooth connection after about 15 minutes every time I'm working out. The sound also gets scratchy. This happens despite being fully charged and having my streaming device less than 1 foot away. Very frustrating. I'm going to have to buy a different pair or go back to using my wired earbuds. Save your money and buy a better quality set of Bluetooth headphones.
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great, they last for all day - no problems. The mic is pretty good during phone calls and they look great! I like that they stay in place around my neck and that they have the magnet so they don't get tangled around other stuff as I'm I'm moving. This is the second pair we bought, my girlfriend liked mine so much I bought her a pair as well. 6 months and going strong!"
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great. They are very comfortable, easy to pair with my phone, easy on and off, and they work well as a phone headset for phone calls also. My main use is listening to music at work. The battery life has adequate for an 8 hour shift. The earbuds have a magnet on each one which holds them together on your chest when you take them out of your ear to keep fthem from getting tangled. These are great."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,So I updating my review. They worked great from july to November but as of Nov 18 one ear bud has gone out. Hope they would of lasted me a year at lest. They surely didn't last. üò£üòñüòûüòûüòüüòü
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I especially like the magnets that enable them to stick together. That way when the fall, they'll just stick to each other and not bounce around like regular earphones"
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones! They are awesome. Great battery life, sweat and water resistant, and very sturdy.

7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound and the fact that these a very light weight. I do have a issue though, when the left ear piece is moved, the sound goes away for a few seconds then returns. I emailed customer service THREE TIMES and no response yet. Three days is plenty of time to respond to my question. I'm not sure if this is normal or defect."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoy listening to music at the gym but my headphones always find themselves falling off or hooking a machine. The neck stiffness is great so that there isn't a huge mess of wires around your neck and the magnets easily wrap around the front of your neck.

4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! The instructions are wrong though. It says to continuously press the MF button to pair the headphones with your phone. Hold the MF button down to get the light to blink. Good sound quality and sound blocking!

6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a few months back and satisfied the fit, sound quality and sturdy construction. For some reason the sound 'clips' (harsh on-off clipping) and also looses the Bluetooth link (""Lost (?) Link"") at times when connected to my iPhone 6 (only feet away). If I could find a solution, I would give it a higher rating."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great even after 6 months. I bought other kinds before and they break after 3 months. The sound is awesome. The function and syncing is great and stay connected at a distance, about 20-30 ft. The battery lasts a long time.. I've never ran out of battery, at least 5-6hrs at a time. I take extra care to hang them when i'm not using so they don't get damaged. I'm here buying 2 more so i don't have to worry about finding another kind for a while if something does happen to these."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are excellent. I've had them since November 2017 and they held up great until I dropped something heavy on them and broke one of the ear buds.
Pros:
- Bluetooth 4.1 - The battery life is excellent

- Long cables and great sound quality

Cons:
- Using them for phone calls is not good. The microphone doesn't seem to be sensitive enough"
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this set for my wife to use when out and about. Very light weight and had issues connecting with her iPhone. Sound quality is solid especially at this price point and Bluetooth connection has had no issues when used with phone nearby. Happy wife happy life.
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, great battery life, zero issue with them popping out, and no complaints about the sound. Definitely not for running though. The part that rests on your neck will bounce and will create a loud THUD in your ear every time you land."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality product for the price! Bought my girl the Beats X, borrowed them and did not like the bass quality. I like to hear all dynamics of the beat! Then I bought the Jaybird Freedom, and those did not stay in my ear. I seen the Best Selling Otium X6 so I decided to give these a shot, and I am extremely happy at this point! I haven't had them long enough to determine the quality of life of the battery but I also know as long as you don't leave the device plugged into the charger after it has reached it's full charge your battery will last longer."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,None of the ear tips that came with didn't fit right. Put some foam tips on and they sounded great for a 23 dollar set of Bluetooth earbuds.
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds performed as advertised. Pairing to a smartphone was easy and reconnect feature works extremely well. Sound is better than expected for the price point. Only drawback, more of a personal preference, the collar type feature which causes the earbud cord to loop. They seat in the ear well and come with multiple sizes of buds for different size eats. The ear hook is removable."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones I had black ones and they work perfectly they are quite fragile but other than that the headphones are great they have an excellent battery life and the sound quality is amazing they are worth the money! They are quite simple to use and comparatively the pairing process is quite simple.

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had them for a solid 36 hours until my young puppy decided it was a wonderful idea to use the earbuds as a chew toy. For the short time that I had them, they worked very well. Very solid product."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. Have had them for a few months now and love them. I really wanted to get the BeatsX but I found this in the process and decided to give them a try. These are a fraction of the price and I have been extremely happy with them so far. They charge up very fast and the battery lasts for what seems like 20 hours as long as I don‚Äôt have the volume very high. Really good headphones. I recommend to anyone wanting good fitting headphones that are tough and won‚Äôt break your budget
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for low price. I use them when I ride my motorcycle and it fits perfectly in the helmet. I also use them at the gym and have no problem with them falling out. I had to read the comments to figure out how to change a song though. Hold down the + or - to skip or go back. Would definitely recommend
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and stay in your ears - perfect for the gym. Bluetooth connectivity was simple and range is decent. Sound quality good, not great, but these are not $300 headphones. If you are looking for a budget pair of bluetooth earbuds for working out, etc. I recommend these highly."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very upset I wish I could get ahold of the company. Bought 2 sets of headphones. Like them a lot! But today
One pair will not power up and sync up with my iPhone.
And yes it has been on the charger all day. I would like a replacement. I‚Äôve only had it for two months. I thought it was better quality than this. I hope the company I bought it from will get ahold of me thanks"
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really great earbuds. Sound quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap. Only problem so far is that they don't always stay in my ear. Charging and syncing is very easy. Really great overall. Definitely recommend!
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than I ever expected. The battery last forever. It can withstand all my activities.

7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. I am so disappointed I can't give a negative star rating on these. They lasted a little over 1 month. Absolute garbage.
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The good: It's cheap, it's comfortable, and it works... for a while.

The bad: Microphone sound quality is crap, and one of the earbuds died (loose wire) within 2 months.

0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,I just bought these on Saturday hopeing for them to be pretty good earphones I received the package rather fast in two days and as soon as I opened them up and connected them they started having issues right side ear bud would come in and out and within minutes stopped working left side ear bud would get loud and then come in and out as well 10 minutes in they Bluetooth disconnected and it happend one more time contacted amazon for a refund and a send back label I do not recommended these headphones to anyone ...
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable headphones for a short time. It‚Äôs nice that they have magnets at the end by the ear piece. I found this convenient when I was in a rush to put them away. The marterial isn't the best quality. So if you don‚Äôt want to spend a lot and will use them for a short time...these will work. I later invested in other headphones.
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered them for a friend. He used them lightly, mainly for homework, yet the piece that actually bonds with the ear bud started cracking. Sounds okay, and pairs easily enough, but the quality apparently isn't the greatest. Was hoping for better, and now I'm 1 month out of the return period."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid construction and great sound for what you pay. They connect via Bluetooth no problem relatively quick and without hassle. Charge time is quick as advertised. My only gripe, and this could just be an issue with the set I received, battery life is horrid. I would say that they only last 2-3 hours of continuous music playback. Not sure if others are having this issue. I may send them pack and grab another pair."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I accidentally purchased this product by pressing the ""buy with one click"" button, but bc I needed a pair, I let fate handle it.
Well, fate said this pair of ear buds suck.
It won't connect to bluetooth. The bluetooth won't even turn on. The magnets are annoying, as well, and I never even got to use these earbuds. Just slipped them on my head for 30 seconds and they wouldn't stay in my ears."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works ok, sound quality is clearly low but I use them for audiobooks which is harder to tell the difference. The convenience of a wireless headset with microphone and audio controls is nice at this price"
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headphone because it's quite light and very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is definitely better than many headphone I used at this price level.

The package includes extra earplugs and it's very thoughtful."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best set of earbuds I've ever owned. Sound quality is great for the price. But the REAL thing I love about 'em is the shape and texture of the cord behind my neck.Before I got it, I am worried about if it can stay in my ears. It keeps the buds in place, but loose enough to where they don't rip the earbuds outta my dang ears if I turn my head or move my neck. So I use it everyday now. Want to bought two extra pairs for my wife and brother."

1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very surprised by how amazing these are! They fit comfortably, sound is amazing, and they even work with Siri! I also like that the buds are magnetized so they‚Äôre not flying everywhere if you have to take them out for a bit. This is ded a must by. Well worth the 20$."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very pleased with these headphones. I received my delivery promptly. It was easy to set up. The quality seems good so far and the wireless set up is great during workouts and multi-tasking. I would purchase the product again and from the same seller.
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds sound,fit nicely. They are nice and long and have a flat cable instead of the round wire. The cons in my case is that they don‚Äôt vibrate,skip or go back on tracks,the pause button doesn‚Äôt work on all apps. Other than that they are good bit don‚Äôt work for me."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôve own about 10 different lg Bluetooths over the years. Lately they haven‚Äôt been holding up too long. I read the reviews on this cheapo... oh well for $19 bucks I‚Äôll try it. It is absolutely unbelievablely good. People say they‚Äôre not hearing my background noise as much. I hear them so well I have to turn it down. Not as bulky around the neck. I just got a 2nd pair for someone else after only having mine for 2 weeks.
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones looks like Beats but the quality is nothing like it. Music listening is ok but call quality is really really bad. Person on other line can‚Äôt hear you at all. Returning!!!

I will be buying a new pair of headphones that is a different brand."

2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones worked well for about 3 weeks. I don't use them every day as I have several different types of headphones. When removing them from my ear one of the buds came apart in my hand. I don't know if it is a product flaw or if I received a dud. I have contacted the seller and am awaiting a response.
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, decent sound and pairs nicely with my phone for music and calls. The neck portion is flexible and very comfortable even with my neck issues"

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased. Excellent sound quality. Syncs with my Android phone and tablet perfectly. Battery life is good as well - lasts me through the day. More than worth the price tag of less than $25!
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones for when I got to the gym, other wireless headphones I bought died on me. These work great so far, the connection is good, they are comfortable and have good sound quality. Only downside is that they don't stay in great when doing cardio, but that was expected. I didn't like the feel of the ones made for jogging so figured I'd roll the dice on these."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried some other headphone but they weren't long enough and would bounce when I ran. These are the perfect length and the controls are easy to reach. I think they are as good as my friends much more expensive ones.
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very high quality. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these in high hopes of be able to workout with them but when I went to connect them with my phone they don‚Äôt work and they don‚Äôt work on my laptop either. I fully charged them and they still don‚Äôt work. You‚Äôre probaly better off getting ones at your local dollar store that work better than these save you $10.
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Was looking for an inexpensive wireless headset for around the house and this fit the bill. I had a little bit of difficulty synching but managed to figure it out.

8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay, doesn't go as loud as I would want but still okay for the price, the neck band is too flimsy, and not long enough to go around my neck."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds great, fits in my ear great, connecting it to my phone was super easy, but the controls can be a bit confusing, and there is a delay when you push pause and when the music actually pauses, it is about a 1 second delay. It also has great noise cancellation, but took a week and a half to ship from a neighboring state."

2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poorly made. The left ear bud is dead. There is no visible sign of a problem. Just no sound. They lasted about a month with minimal usage, on average twice a week for about 45 minutes to an hour at the gym,"
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a pair to try; liked them so bought a pair as a gift. The sound quality is good, for the price and the Bluetooth in the area works well, so it's a great set up. The headphones fit nicely and are comfortable at staying put. Great deal all around."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! So I purchased theses headphones for when I train , let me tell you they are awesome! I tried the Jaybird Wireless headphones, Bose , Skull Candy and a few others, The Orion X6 blow them out of the water. The price is untouchable compared to any higher end headphones the preform and stay in your ears better then any, The sound quality is just as good or better then the Jaybirds. I hope this review helps. I'm super happy with my purchase!"
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two pair. Both work great. I get 50-60ft line of sight range and 15-20 through walls. 9 hours of play time fully charged. Mic can be a little weak if the ambient noise is up. Works great though.

7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable , good sound quality. Good noise blocking quality. I use these primarily at work but they work well at the gym as well."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the headphones so that I could charge my iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time. They seem to get the job done - sound quality isn't great, but holds a charge for most of the day. Charging cord is SHORT - maybe 3 inches? Tough to trade in and out of USB ports. But decent for the price."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The speakers just don't sound pleasant. Very little low-end and just flat. Stock IPhone headphones sound way better, and they're not that great...

They do have a pretty decent range and the unit itself is reasonably light. The earbud fitment can be finicky, however. Not sure I'd recommend these to anyone other than to those who want something really cheap to use as a handsfree device."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was easy to pair the headphones with my phone and the magnetic ends of each ear bud will definitely keep these from falling off my neck or at the very lease keep me from being aware that they did fall off. My only complaint is that the volume up, down and the power/pairing mode buttons are all the same size and I'd totally prefer a track to roll to change the volume instead.

These headphones will be used at work and should there be any issue with the item I will update my review."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I bought these is because they said it would work 9 hours without recharging. The next best I could find was 6 hours.

The first 5 months of use they worked great and I always had at at least 9 hours of listening without having to recharge. Then suddenly the ear bud on the side without controls started go in in and out. I found a way to get it to stay on, but if I moved it would go out again. A couple of weeks after that the other side started going out too. It's short was were the wire went into the hard part around the neck. The other side's short was were the cable entered the ear bud.

Considering the reviews of similar items I guess I'm lucky to have gotten 5 months of quality use out of this pair. I did use them several days a week during that time. But I expect more quality than that."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I noticed on this bluetooth headphone is that the headphone is very light. I feel like I don't have it in my neck when I'm using it. I have my old LG bluetooth headphone and that is heavy compared to this one. The magnetic earbud is a plus feature, it secures the headphone by connecting together when not in use and just hanging in my neck. The ear wings helps secure the headphone when I'm using it to prevent it from falling off when I'm in my threadmill. Another plus is the sound quality, I didn't have to crank the volume all the way up to get to my desired listening level. For the price and the good quality of this bluetooth headphone, I definitely will recommend it to my friends."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless sports earphones are very nice... I bought this for my friends birthday and she really like this... it works perfectly.. the sound is very clear... included charger... higgly recomended...
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really happy with these so far. I've had them around a month or so and I've been impressed. As a woman with a narrow neck I was concerned that the fit would be really bad but they stay in place pretty well and really stay out of the way especially compared to other around the neck bands. I swapped out the earbuds for memory foam for preference but the original tips din't seem bad.

The ear fins move around quite a bit and I've actually had them fall off once. Not a deal breaker but sometimes causes problems if you take your headphones in and out a lot.

Battery is definitely not as advertised. I would say I get closer to 5 or 6 hours without turning them off but for price and fit, thats really not too bad.

I'll see how these hold up as time goes but so far I'm really happy with these and I'm ridiculously picky when it comes to my headphones."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my earbuds for phone calls, during long distance running, and while lifting weights and training. After testing many BlueTooth styles and brands I found the Otium ""neckband"" earphone design stays in my ears the most securely; isn't easily dislodged or lost; they don't interfere with most exercise body movements; and the batterylife is longer than any other BlueTooth earbuds I've seen. The Otium X6 was excellent for me and suited my needs perfectly!

The first set of Otium X6 earphones I purchased were excellent, but only worked for a few weeks. They stopped transmitting sound and would not hold a charge.
The second set of Otium X6 earphones I bought arrived with an unstable right ear connection, resulting in muffled sounds or none at all.

I am extremely disappointed by the poor quality and weak durability of the Otium X6. While I'm hopeful for a pair that will work, I'm hesitant to repurchase another set of X6 earphones.
I will be much more wary of any Otium products in the future."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty good! Not excellent, not great, but pretty good. For the price, they're a great value. The audio quality isn't very high, but if you're just using them for phone calls, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. -- they're fantastic. Music? For exercise they're fine, since quality isn't super important when you're jogging or riding your bike with all that road noise, etc., but otherwise -- these are comparable to $10 Skull Candy earbuds, as far as audio quality. Great for spoken word, not so great for music.

Battery life seems good -- 6-8 hours, depending on usage, but fine for me.

I do really like how they work with Siri on my iPhone, though -- just a double-tap of the center button and she's ready for me to ask her add something to my calendar or reminders list. The fit and finish is really nice on these as well. No weird, cheap, plastic whose finish kinda rubs off on your fingers after a while. Very solidly built and great for wearing around the house, the office, while exercising -- basically wherever, which is the point of these, right?!

Overall -- these are an excellent purchase and I've been using them for about a week now around the house, listening to podcasts. Really, really great for that!"
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I really like these. My old bulky set died and I was looking for a set that was lighter and smaller. I ordered 2 different brands and originally these were not my first choice because the ear bud wires come out the bottom of the necklace and there is no magnetic storage for the ear buds on the necklace. However, after using and listening to them I consider these the best set I have ever owned. The design is well thought out and they have a look and feel of quality. The 3 buttons are well separated, and easy to find with your fingers. I am no audiophile but I am very happy with the sound quality. The other brand that I bought sound a little bit ""tinny"" and are a little short on bass, but this set seems to have hit it just about right. The ear buds do hang down when not in use but they have strong magnets and lock together tightly. Supposedly these are designed to be sweat and water resistant as well. I really don't think you can go wrong with these, especially for the price. I am going to use these for a couple of weeks and if all goes well I will buy another set as a spare."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve bought a fair share of Bluetooth headsets, I would lose them or the battery would last only for a few hours. Most of the time they are used when I run and it gets frustrating when these headsets don‚Äôt work. This one just died and stopped working after a couple of weeks using.

Though there are some positives for this headset. I do like how the neck band isn‚Äôt a huge piece of plastic and fits nicely around the neck. The ear buds fit comfortably in the ear and doesn‚Äôt fall of when running. The magnets with the neckband will guarantee I won‚Äôt lose these headsets.

Now the negatives. My first time using them was amazing, actually it did stop playing for a few seconds, but that‚Äôs common with all Bluetooth headsets. After that these headsets brought the following problems: just stops playing, refuses to power on, volume suddenly turns down to 25%, and refuses to pair with device. Sometimes I‚Äôll be running and no audio is coming out. I tried resetting, disconnecting the Bluetooth and pairing again, resetting my phone and none of these solutions work. It would suddenly works the next day to only cause one of the problems listed above.

Then it finally died, won‚Äôt power on or charge. Amazon was awesome and gave me a refund. I love how it fitted nicely and was secure just wished it work."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ever since purchasing my first iPhone, I hav been super annoyed about not having a headphone jack. This is my third pair of wireless headphones now. My first set was a pair of cheapies that had a ringing sound the entire time they were on. So, my husband bought me an expensive set that is nice but bulky and pulls strands of my hair out when sitting on my neck. I decided to try these and am so pleasantly surprised! They are so lightweight that I barely realize they are there yet stay in place perfectly so are great for even gym use. They came with 3 size ear cushions which is important for me because I have tiny ears. The biggest surprise was that the sound quality far surpassed my expectations for the price, and there is no hissing or ringing sound from the Bluetooth connection. I‚Äôm so glad I bought these!"
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great bluetooth ear phone. I have been using it everyday while I am working out.

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the idea of Bluetooth headphones, but these are a little bulkier than I was expecting because of the thick plastic controls and the curved, non wire neck piece.

A quality product with great sound. I have been using a Bluetooth product that is four times the cost of the X6 ... and the X6 had better sound and is actually more comfortable to wear. And ... and an 18-month full replacement warranty comes with product registration. Amazing! I am sold on Otium.

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked well for aprox 90 hours of use total over the past 6 months. Bought because they were sweatproof, used for gym workout."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. They last a long time and I have yet to run out of battery. Although I've run very low on battery, they charged fully in less than an hour. The sound quality is good; I love bass and one of factors for me when I buy a pair of headphones is if you can hear or feel bass-most definitely can :-) I am confident that these will last a long time. The wire is stiffer which is awesome as they don't slide or pull to one side. The buds themself are comfortable & come with 3 sizes to fit snug along w/2 loops to hold securely. Pairing with multiple devices was idiot proof. These are definitely a great headphone at a very reasonable price"
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were great for a few months, I received then on October 1st, 2017, and at the end of February, the left headphone stopped working. It almost seems like there is a short where the headphone wire goes into the neckband. The cord here is very thin, and should probably be reinforced in some way.
Will not be purchasing these again, but would consider a different model by the same brand, because they were great while they lasted."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been hesitant to spend more than a little cash in a set of in-ear headphones because I seems to have smallish ears. Most in-ear buds or headphones are very uncomfortable (Beats, Apple Earpods, etc.). I took a chance and am very happy I did. These fit very snug, but flexible enough for long-term wear. They have a decent range, feel very light on the ears, have good battery life, and magnets design keeps it safe in a good place. Good bass response without sounding ""woofy"" like Beats. At this price, I highly recommend them."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize how much I would love wireless headphone until I actually tried them. I admit that I'm late to the game, but as a runner, I finally became fed up with the cord sometimes pulling lose with a random arm swing or turn. I have found that these stay in place throughout my run and actually feel secure. Once they're in, I don't have to ever readjust them. Although I had to have someone younger than me show me how to pair the headphones to my phone, that's now done and I don't have to mess with it again. I simply turn the headphones on with the on button and I'm ready to go. The microphone works well when making calls and I've never had anyone tell me that they couldn't hear me clearly."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use iPhone's original wire headphones. It was truly annoying to unwire them before use, and it was also frustrating that you have to use earphone and charge the phone at the same time.

Life has been a breeze since I get this product. No wires any more. Doesn't need to plug in any more and I can charge at the same time. I like the design that it rests around my neck. So the earphones are standing by neatly during intermittent usage. The sound quality is good too. Love it!"
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely do not recommend. Ended up returning them.

Pro: soft neckband, pretty okay bass, magnetic

Con: a full one-or-two-second fade in from silence every time there is a bluetooth blip or dropped data. It is infuriating and makes listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or voice chats (like in gaming) almost impossible. This was enough to make me want to return them, but the nail in the coffin was that when you receive a phone call, the headphones read out (slowly) the entire phone number before allowing you to answer.

I'm amazed these ""features"" weren't included in other reviews. They made these headphones almost completely unusable."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even after buying this product I've been reading the reviews. Ill have to update if I have any issues with them. But so far I absolutely love these headphones. They are lightweight, rain proof, sound quality is amazing and battery life is good. I've had them for a week and I use them often, today was the first time I needed to charge them. These are comparable to the $120 BeatsX. $100 cheaper and the sound quality is just as good. I also purchased the 3 year Asurion warranty through Amazon, just in case anything does happen. Overall I would highly recommend, especially for the price."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a great sport wireless headphones I bought. It's easy to connected my iPhone and so strong to stay inside my ears. And it's also has good tone quality.The most important is cheap!! I bought monster and base, even though the tone quality is perfect. But it is easy to out of my ears when I was running. And it's definitely expensive.
This wireless headphones is good for sports and I will recommend my friends when someone need."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive had these a few weeks. This is the 5th pair of Bluetooth earbuds I've tried, and my favorite so far. Very secure for jogging, comfortable, good sound, block outside wind/noise. Battery life seems good, but I don't push it past 4 hours before recharging because I hate batteries dying mid-jog. Also, the connection to my device is strong. Other headphones I've owned cut in and out when you're moving too much, or if your device is on the side of your body furthest from controls on headphones. These do not. And the neckband/weighted sides keep them secure so the cord isn't pulling toward the one side, as others have done. They're designed very smart. Solved all my other earbud issues. I recommend these!"
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping. Charged upon arrival. Charged fast. I don‚Äôt like the wings so I removed them. I absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è the sound and the feel around my neck. I‚Äôll be purchasing another pair for my daughter. These headphones paired perfectly with my iPhone 8 Plus.

Update:
Still the best wireless headphones! My brother brought me a pair of BeatsX and I HATE them ok!!!!"
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and the part that goes around your neck keeps the ear buds from falling out. It also allows for less of a pulling feel in the ear buds. Like they aren't being yanked out of your ears from gravity.

At the beginning, I found that's hard to connect with my phone, but it turned out that, when initialling the setup, just press the power button and don't release until you hear ""paring"", and then it takes only seconds to pair. The sound quality is really worth its price, and it is water splash proof. So highly recommended."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really! I've been through all kinds of earplugs all the time.

It is really convenient. I can put my mobile on my bedroom and walk around when I call someone and my mobile is being charged.

And it can connect 2 devices at the same time, but this will affect the quality of sound."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these at work. I have an office and sound travels from the other offices through the ceiling so i have been trying to drown the noise out with regular earbuds. I didn't think that they were noise cancelling at first but then pushed them in further and voila! i couldn't hear anything besides my music. Plus I don't have to jack up the sound really high and the sound quality increased once i had it in my ear properly. It paired with my iphone SE super fast but I had to update the bluetooth driver on my computer at work for it to work on my machine.
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Came from Beats earbud wired to these - BOOM goes the bass! These sound better and I'm not just saying that - I have been using solid 3 weeks with no hiccups - battery life is better than stated as well - only recharged once and linked with my Apple Watch and phone - have used over the carplay as well due to the noise cancelling characteristics - could not be more happy!
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! They cancel out quite a bit of noise too. The battery life is great so far.. I‚Äôve had them for about 8 months too
The only thing that I don‚Äôt like (and this is just nitpicking) is when I try to skip a song, you can‚Äôt press twice like you would on apple iPhone headphones otherwise your phone redials! There is another command to skip/go back songs and volume buttons though!"
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these when riding my motorcycle. I had to switch out the earpieces with some triple flange tips I had laying around, this gave me the noise isolation I needed to not be deafened by wind noise. With these in, I can protect my hearing from wind noise while hearing navigation directions or listening to music. Holds a charge just fine, they're low enough profile to fit inside my helmet."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally found the headphones that designed for sports use. I have bought so many different wireless earphones over the years but this is the one I really like. It stays in my ears when I run.

6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of LG HBS 700, then I miss placed them somewhere, lost now, but had years of great use out of them. Before I got these, I got a set of BeatsX, well those got returned after trying them out for a day. They sounded like any old cheapo ear buds, the ear cushions did not block out any outside noise (sound leak), and only last around 6.5hrs, not the up to 8 hrs claimed (continuous play). For there price you can get nothing in returned but over priced and an over rated brand. We'll these for the price is a great buy, been using them for a few days now and they have lived up to the specs. Got a total of 11.5 hrs continuous play, sound quality is excellent, controls are straight forward and work as is. No complaints here but getting a 2nd pair for my office use. Confident i'll have years of great use of of these like my LG one's."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These inexpensive headphones are simply incredible. So far I would give them 6 stars if I could. I use them on my motorcycle. I am literally able to ride down the Interstate at 80 mph and hear every word and every note. I used them to and from work today on my 40 mile commute, including 20 miles of Interstate each way. The noise cancelling is superb. It reduces the wind noise down to a level where the music comes through loud and clear. The wind noise is usually deafening, but with these little gems in I barely hear it. Be sure to use the correct size rubber tip for the best results, (three different sizes are included). I highly recommend them for motorcyclists. Just be careful and pay attention because you also barely hear the traffic around you. But that's what your eyes and your mirrors are for!"
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really excellent bluetooth headphones. Paired easily, has great sound quality (some of the best I've experienced), and most of all are very lightweight. Bought these to replace a pair of bluetooth headphones that had the battery attached to the earpiece, which made it bulky and heavy, and stuck out of my ears in a really conspicuous way. These are the opposite. Sometimes I forget I have them on. Very pleased with this product."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved this product in the beginning. However, after only one month of using these headphones, it went downhill. The first time I contacted this company, they were quick to respond. My second correspondence got no response and I just sent my third correspondence and awaiting a response. I purchased two of these headphones, one for me and one for my husband. Mine went downhill and my husband's is still going strong. I feel that I received a defective item and for some reason, their customer service is not responding to my attempts. Not happy with this AT ALL."

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best!!!!!!!
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones and they won‚Äôt pair with devices, your supposed to press what‚Äôs called an MF button until it blinks red and blue alternatively. And the head phones don‚Äôt do that, they turn off blink blue lights but that is about it, really disappointed."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this light weighted wireless headphone. The headphone will stay around your neck and will not move around when you are jogging. The music quality is good and easy to control. Super sensitive and easy to hook up with my phone. My friends had tried it out and they placed the order for this headphone too.
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Huge money saving rather than spend almost 100$, you can get this product with as little as 20$. This Bluetooth headphone is very light and suitable to wear all day long. A full charged headphone can last at least 6 hour+. I have wear it everyday and hang around to my neck as a standby mode."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, these headphones aren‚Äôt sweat proof, I can barely get them to stay in while biking let alone jogging.
Second, they lose connection with your connected device frequently and even at close range (phone was in my pocket and it disconnected more than 5 times in 30 mins of jogging) The battery life is also horrendous, barely goes 2 hours with a full charge.
These headphones are terrible. They‚Äôre so annoying when you have to constantly reconnect them. Don‚Äôt waste your money, buy the expensive quality headphones if you don‚Äôt want the headache."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first set came to me with a short in the left ear, but when I contacted the seller via Amazon the immediately sent me a replacement. I wear the headphones constantly, using them primarily to listen to audiobooks on walks and bike rides. Is but these again. They sound great and work as expected."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this headphone for about couple weeks and I'm really surprised about the battery life and how cool it looks. I use this daily and I love it! Only blemish is that I couldn't really fun fast wearing this obviously because it was keep bouncing off and hitting my neck back every time.
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always had trouble with every pair of headphones I've gotten. They all had that heavy Mic box and it drove me insane! They were always falling off my head. Then I got these! They have a supportive neckband so they don't fall off. And they have to separate batteries so it lasts for almost 10 hours. They're great!
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Took me forever to figure out how to connect it, but when I did it got excited. This is the part that's a five star. They're really light weight and super comfortable on the neck; you can't even tell they're there. They stay centered when hanging down; which is really nice. These are my first earphones with fins that I have personally used and they are surprisingly more comfortable than I thought. Now this is where is gets down to 3 stars. The left earphone has to be messed with in order to sound the way it's supposed to. When it's working the sound is fantastic with pretty good bass. When it's not working the sound is extremely muted and is super noticeable. Keep in mind this is my first day getting them and using them. If the warranty replacement goes through I am more than willing to bring this rating up to five star."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this wireless headphones for my daughter because she likes to listen music while she does exercise, after I received it I asked her back it to me if she doesn‚Äôt like it but after she tried the headphone, she likes it very much and alway show me how nice the quality is, she said she will tell her fridends to buy it too."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the design. When I'm not using it, it sits comfortably around my neck, the magnetic earbud clipped together forming a closed loop so I don't have worries losing the earphone. I use the smallest ear piece provided in the package, the sound quality is great and my ears don't hurt. This is a great product."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far great. Looking forward to lots of use.
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lose connection easily
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these wireless headphones. Great sound quality and easy to Bluetooth to your phone! I can listen to all my music on my phone while getting ready, taking a walk, cleaning, etc. crystal clear sound quality! No static or fuzz. Very great quality and durable! Highly recommended! Would definitely purchase again!"
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome! They make my workday go by fast. I used to call in all the time. Now i have an audible membership and i rarely call in sick. I know that sounds lame, but it's true. I work in a laboratory and am very social. But much of my work is independent and i would get SO bored. Now i listen to books all day. Perfect. The battery lasts forever and it charges really fast. I also take it home with me on m y weekends to use while I'm cleaning."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"In love! This is great! I used it the first time today. It is very easy to connect to my phone, and the sound is awesome. I tried to run to a diff room of the house, and it still works ! Also, the noise cancellation is good. Exactly what I was looking for."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking headphones. Took about five minutes to pair with cellphone, but once it paired it was fine. Excellent sound, and looks very ""cool"" on. I've paired it with iPad and an android cellphone and had no issues."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These paired easily, are very light weight, and the sound is great. The back of each ear bud is magnetic and oppositely poled from its counterpart, so they magnetically snap together to secure them around one's neck when not in use. Nice feature."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product! Works straight forward right out of the box. It's very easy to connect to my phone. The earbuds perfectly fit to my ears. It also comes with the hooks to help the earbuds stay in place even you work out or run hard outside. The sound quality is decent for the price. It's a little bit distortion when turn the volume all the way up. Very happy with the purchase!
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The effect of sound in this headphone very very comfortable. And also easy hang on my clothes, not easy to lost . And another headphone I used before, my ear is pain . But the new one today my ear is not pain any more!"
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were working fine for about a month and half. one day I put them on the charger (the one provided) and when I took them off about an hour later they had shorted out, overheated, and exploded. Potentially very dangerous, glad it didn't happen while I was wearing them"
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to have these earphones, because I get annoyed by the cord on my traditional earbuds getting caught on stuff or just otherwise distracting me.These otium headphones are pretty good,they stay in my ear and of course there is no cord to get tangled. For phone use, people I'm talking to report that I sound loud and clear, even when talking while walking on a busy street with traffic. So I highly recommended them! Just buy it man!!"
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Product was broke before i even used it. The left side ear piece wasn't making sound.

4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Left microphone stopped working not even three months of use
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good Bluetooth headphone, it will be stay firmly around the head and won't be moving up and down with vigorous movements. And also has good sound experience, very comfortable, anyone have the pursuit of stable and soft products could try it."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"First day of having it and it was a pain to connect to my phone.. Note to self when you get this, first turn it on then immediately after pressing the on button hold it down until the red/blue lights flash. Otherwise if you don't do that after turning it on you will be just turning the headset on and off over and over... So be quick!"
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great. However, I must rate 2 stars because the charging cord does not work. I‚Äôm using a different one although the instructions say not to use any other or it might damage the headphones. I hope it doesn‚Äôt!
Update: I changed the rating to 4 stars because they are really decent for the price. I have been able to charge them with a different cord for almost three months now and they still work just fine."

0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give it less than one star if I could , straight Out of the Box they would not connect to my phone... the most ridiculous thing is Amazon will now keep my money for a product that never worked until they get it shipped back to them what a unbelievable inconvenience"
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is very clear. It is very comfortable. The battery life is more than enough. Just what I needed for a Bluetooth headphones.

5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Just received today. No problem so far. Charged and ease with correcting to device. Volume and bass just right. Haven't tried one a call yet. Will update if not satisfied. But will change rating to 5 üåü once experience call with a positive outcome. Worth what I paid.
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. I use them when I walking to school and have no problem with them falling out. I would recommend this headphone.

9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"They connect easily, the battery doesn't last as long as some other wireless ear buds.
I've been through about 8 pairs of these and other wireless ear buds, trying to find the ones that work best for me (lightweight, excellent sound quality, buds don't feel like they are about to be ripped out of my ear, etc..)

They don't skip much, even when moving. Beyond that I don't like the sound quality. Ever since those beat headphones came out every cheap headphone/earbud manufacturer TURNS THE FACTOEY SETTINGS FOR BASS WAY TOO HIGH!!! I listen to actual music, rock with different instruments, orchestra, electronica, and heavily lyrical music. The bass is way too high to enjoy a full music experience with these buds. I haven't touched the equalizer on my phone in about a year, and have to adjust them to turn down the bass on these. Now I'll have to adjust them EVERY TIME, cause the sound is fine with my other Bluetooth devices (car, motorcycle).

Dear ear buds manufacturers, NOT EVERY CUSTOMERS JUST WANTS TO HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF BASS BLASTING IN THEIR EARS.... SOME CUSTOMERS LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC!! NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF BASS!! I'm so sick and tired of paying $30 here, $40 there trying to find a quality set of ear buds only to have mini bass machines that just make my music sound like crap......"

2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Did a lot of research. Bought eight pairs of headphones. This one came out on top. Comfortable, good sound quality, and the buds seal out a lot of external noise. The only thing I don't like is the voice FREQUENTLY reminding you to charge it when it's low on battery. I get it, it needs to charge! However the voice is LOUD and cuts over whatever you're trying to listen to."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,The Bluetooth connection is no good
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great the range is better than the other one I have which is 30 feet, I can get about 50 yards away from my iPad before it cuts out. It may be producing more RF radiation than the other one though so I think I will only use it when I need wireless hand free applications."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I did have some initial static that disappeared when I forgot, then repaired to my device. Surprisingly good sound when you push them well into your ears. Battery life is effective through the use of active power management"

7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked these at first. The sound quality was decent, especially for the price. However within a few weeks the sound started to cut out from simple things like the ""shock"" of briskly walking downhill as my foot hit the ground. Within another week just turning my head or another object touching it would make the sound cut out for several seconds. I didn't really continue to use them afterwards to see what further progression the might have been."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to work fine and does have a good sound but From the pictures I thought it was just a long cord and it‚Äôs not. the neck piece is actually hard plastic and shaped to fit around your neck. Seems like a fine product and a good price but Just not what I was looking for
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Can‚Äôt rebiew because I returned them only because my son wanted different style
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my headphone, but there is a problem with them, when in use static is been heard, it's very annoying to listen."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These things are hunks of garbage. They don't connect and then sound quality is horrible. I'd rather stick cacti in my ears and listen through the blood. Not even worth the price. I had a pair previously that were great and when I reordered they felt cheap and crappy like a tiajuana woman.
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,The earphones were fine at first and randomly stopped working in the right ear. Should've bought beats instead :(
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say this is completely waste of time and money. this crap just stop working in less that a month. thanks that I have prime and send it back and get my money quick. this had big big big problem with the connection, I did a hard reset as they told me to does. and the connection is crap and today they just stop working.
It works some time better than other. When I got this Bluetooth at first I love them. But now that I use them for some time I do not sure if I'll keep them or I'm returning them. The problem is with the conection that some time and now is doing more it had interference and drop the conection. I used another Samsung Bluetooth and I had zero problem with conection. The battery in this Bluetooth is amazing and the Bluetooth are very light. But lattlely I had this big bug with the connection dropping more and more. Some time you are in the middle of a conversation and you do not want at all your conversation."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,reminds me of a 1960's transistor radio.....like listening through a tin can. Bass is literally nonexistent - the ONLY thing these would be good for is a Podcast. I would absolutely not recommend this product......old Apple phone ear phones sound 100 times better.
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality headphones. Would not pair with any device.
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound pretty good, and they were surprisingly inexpensive for Bluetooth earphones, and they add some nice features, but because those features override standard behavior, switching between these earphones and normal ones can be a little frustrating.

Most audio programs for mobile platforms have a user-definable function for double-clicking the remote button. You can skip ahead a few seconds to fast-forward through podcast advertisements. You can jump back a few seconds in case you missed something in your audiobook. You can skip to the next track. Etc.

These earphones override that functionality and will only re-dial the last-called number on your phone when you double-click the ""MF Button."" However, they include a useful feature to rewind or fast-forward a little but by holding down the volume up or down buttons for a few seconds, giving you more flexibility once you get used to the non-standard operation.

Another minor annoyance is that if you pause the audio on your phone for awhile (for example, to finish writing/editing a review for the earphones), the earphones will automatically disconnect and reconnect to your Bluetooth device (e.g. phone) every so often, which is really jarring, because the ""Disconnected.. pairing.. connected"" voice prompts are quite a bit louder than they should be (that is, they're louder than most audio content you'll be listening to).

The issue with the voice prompt volume being too loud affects all aspects of these earphones - powering on, powering off, pairing, connecting, and disconnecting. They're just too loud and jarring, or when they're not, other content is too quiet."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"They work ok except if you're talking on the phone with them. When you're on a call, they will randomly loose connection, say they are re-pairing, But, won't. You have to turn them off only to have them repair, and then drop again. Annoying message telling you battery is low keeps playing every few seconds, until batteries die."
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,This headset is very comfortable in my ear and the sound quality was great. But it stared to over heat within 30 minutes of being turned on. Not even listening to music or talking just on. Really like it but the feeling of your neck getting burned is a no go. My search goes on.
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are pretty comfortable and have a decent enough Bluetooth range, and a decent battery life. My biggest complaint is that the volume for low battery, power on/off and pairing notifications is really loud. Much louder than the volume I have my music set it. It's annoying, but not a deal breaker."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,would pair get a phone call. half way thru conversation it would unpair in middle of conversation !
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"One star is too generous. Fresh out the box Connection is sketchy st best. They sound fine as long as I don't turn my head to the right, bend over, or do anything but sit perfectly still. Do not buy them, they're a waste of money. I'm going to try a different brand for a few more dollars."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked great the first couple of days, then they stopped playing any form of media.

First pair, loved the fit and all, however, too much feedback when using the bluetooth on phone call. Tried another pair from another seller, but hated the fit on those. The fit on these Otiums was too good. So I decided to exchange. No feedback, so far on this pair. Descent sound, very comfortable around neck and in ear."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the comfort and fit of these ear buds, and they work great for watching movies on my devices. The only problem I am having with them is that they frequently disconnect from my phone during phone calls, making it so that I have to then go from hands free to either speaker or using my phone.... Which if you live in the state of Washington it is illegal to even touch your phone while you are driving. So if your plan is to only use them for movies and videos you are set."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is better than expected but it disconnects on every call very disappointed.
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. It goes in and out every now and then which is annoying. I'm hoping that it stays working well since I got it to use while I'm at work.
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for the price.

Brand: Otium
Model: X6 Neckband Wireless Headphones

Overall Rating: 4/5 if they work, 1/5 currently.

Introduction:
I love headphones, I absolutely enjoy getting new headphones, trying out new headphones, and talking about headphones. I ordered these headphones along with another pair of Otium headphones and was fortunately able to try out both at the same time. Up until recently, these were my favorite pair of headphones. They currently, however, will not charge and so I cannot use them. It may be the cable I have to charge them, I will update this if trying a different cable helps.

Product Description:
These are Bluetooth headphones that consist of two earbuds wired to a necklace-like device that rests around your neck. The earbuds themselves have no buttons on them but there are three buttons on the right side of the necklace: volume down, a utility button, and volume up.

The length of the earbud cord from the necklace is plenty long enough to be comfortable while not being too long and awkward. The necklace is great if you are just listening in one ear as the other headphone will hang without dragging that ear out. Often Bluetooth headphones consist of two earbuds attached only via a cord, like Beats' popular model. While these are stylish, they are absolutely frustrating when using one headphone at a time as the non-used headphone will literally drag the other one out of your ear. For most people this isn't an issue as they are perfectly content ignoring the rest of the world, so two ears is fine with them. I like hearing people/sounds as I'm listening so unless I'm alone studying/reading I typically only use 1 ear at a time.

One more nice feature is that the volume down button is the first (and therefore easiest) button so that if the music is suddenly too loud you can quickly alleviate that.

The earbuds also have small rubber flaps designed to help them stay in your ear better. These are actually quite useful and, unlike some other headphones I've used, they actually stay on decently well. If the flaps bother you they are easily removable (or re-attachable if you change your mind) as you just slide the rubber ring on/off.

The headphones come with three different sizes of grips, but they are not very high quality grips. They work fine, don't get me wrong, but they're just the standard quality rubber.

Finally, the earbuds can magnetically stick together, which is semi-useful if you're wearing the headphones but not using them. By sticking them together they don't fly around as much.

Product Features
The headphones can easily connect via Bluetooth to my phone and laptop, at the same time if desired, and likely to additional devices. The necklace can adjust the volume by pressing the volume up/down buttons or change tracks by holding the volume up/down buttons. Power is controlled by holding the middle utility button, holding it turns them on/off. Pressing it once without holding pauses/resumes the music. Overall, most standard music controls can be achieved via the necklace without even looking at your phone/device.

In terms of sound quality, these are among the best cheap headphones I've ever used, and I've had about 20 pairs of headphones. In fact, until they stopped working these were my favorite pair to use. I even brought them to Kauai with me. I did, however, say these are among the best ""cheap"" headphones. My favorite pair of headphones was an old pair of Sony headphones called ""Extra Bass headphones"". They cost about $60, sounded beautiful, and the bass vibrated from them so well. These cost about $24 currently ($90 originally), but I would be willing to pay about $30 for them. They sound great but their range is not as wide as the Sony ones, they have great deep bass but not quite those of the Sony headphones or the other Otium ones, and they seal out sound well but again, not quite as well as the Sony ones.

In terms of battery life (before they stopped charging on me), they lasted about 2-3 hours or so. Honestly not the greatest battery for me, but they worked well enough and charge quickly enough that it wasn't a huge issue. The low battery life and poor quality grips were the main reasons I would give them a 4/5.

Pros:
Necklace with many controls easily-accessible.
Phenomenal sound for the price I paid.
Earbuds designed to stay in ear.
Earbuds can clip together to prevent flying around.
Easy Bluetooth connectivity to multiple devices.
Decent sound cancellation.

Cons:
Not as powerful or clear as higher-end headphones.
Grips provided with headphones are average-quality.
They stopped working on me.
Conclusion:
Great-quality headphones for the price until they stopped retaining battery charge.

Update!!!
I contacted the seller, explained the issue about the battery charge, and they sent me a new replacement free of charge. This new pair holds a charge much better than the initial ones, so I bringing my review back up to 4/5."
0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found a few different types of Bluetooth headphones, and these ones were fairly average. I wish they weren't so long. The sound quality is not as good as other ones I have had it, but the bass is still prominent. I don't like how the music fades in and out when pressing play and pause. The range is sub par, but as long as I am in the same room they stay connected. This headphone is terrible for runners. The part around the Neck tends to bounce up and down."
1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so the build quality is decent, they are decently comfortable, and the battery life is great but let me tell you these things sound like garbage. the sound is very thin there is almost no bass I have to turn bass boost up on my computer just to barely hear the bass line of of a song. The treble is harsh and tinny. I've tried all the tips and ear wings to try and get better sound but this just doesn't make the cut at all. I bought these because many reviewers said they liked the sound quality and the bass was good. This simply is not true

The quality was great they are super lightweight and true to the sweat proof, honestly if it wasn't for the headphone going out after 10 days these headphones could easily be rated 5 star"
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These a good sound good bass but the connectivity is bad they disconnect on their own they don't have a long range At all
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones. They were easy to pair with my iPhone and had good range. If I went out of range they would automatically reconnect when I got near the phone again. Best of all, they would hold a charge for 8 hours (I listen to books while working). This week they developed a short in the left bud, which is annoying, but they won't charge any more, which is fatal. Last week I would have given this product 5 stars. This week, 1 star. I have had them since about the middle of July."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds aren‚Äôt great. I think the weight of the magnets that keep them around your neck when they aren‚Äôt in your ears are too heavy. They actually won‚Äôt stay in my ears because of the weight!

7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,I would give these no stars but that is not an option.

A lot more sturdy than my old ones this replaced for riding while wearing under my helmet. I previously had 2 old one's that damaged due to thin cables and cost more, which were similar to the LG Tones.

Only CONs:
1) I wish it vibrates when a call comes in since I don't leave it in-ear that often when working so it'd be nice if it vibrated to inform me of calls.

2) Also, I wish it'll let me know battery status when ever I power on the device; that way I will know just about when to charge again as it's not easy to gauge when since I last charged.

Will definitely buy again, especially if they upgraded with newer features as discussed."

When I first started using these, I loved them. I did have to buy smaller earbuds because my ear holes are tiny. It worked great, but after maybe 10 uses, the right speaker blew and now it's useless. For the price it's not bad, but I was hoping it would last longer and wouldn't die so quickly.

They're so oddly stiff, The pictures make you believe the thicker plastic band is just on the back, but it comes around the front of my neck, connecting, like a weird necklace.

originally purchased apples beats x for use at work and the gym.. did not know that they were not sweat proof so i never did take them to work since my job is outside in the heat and and high humidity. did not want to ruin a 150$ set of earbuds on day one.. i saw these from otium and decided to purchase.. very glad i did.. sound just as good as my beats x they fit just as good.. battery lasts just as long .. AND THEY ARE SWEAT PROOF.. $16 vs $150 ... i wish i had bought these first.. could have save some cash for bought 10 pairs of these for the same price as my beats.. so now the beats are at home earbuds and these are all day everyday work ..workout. sweat and not worry earbuds.. thanks otium for a nice product and amazing price"
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good when they work. They do however consistently go quite when you are moving before they come back on.

Additionally, while the battery life seems to be very good, once they get low you get a constant ""low battery, please charge"" comment in your ear every 15-20 seconds at a high volume. It makes it unbearable to listen to when it's low.

There's nothing worse than being in the middle of a workout where you want the music, and despite the headphones having another 20+ minutes of charge left you are stuck hearing ""low battery, please charge"" every 15 seconds. That ""feature"" alone will prevent me from buying these a second time.

I just left the gym and it annoyed me enough to time it. It takes 3 seconds to say that and does it once every 20 seconds. The headphones lasted 16 minutes after that notification and it was a miserable experience"

1,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used other brands of around the neck headphones for years. I saw this on a lightening deal and decided to give it a shot. After a couple of weeks of use I really like them. I primarily listen to Podcasts, and audio books, not music, so I won't judge the sound quality other than to say the spoken word sounds very good. The earbuds have little ""arms"" that help hold them in your ears. When working under a car or RV these are light enough that they don't tend to fall off as easily as others I have used. Plus they the ear pieces are held together magnetically if not in your ears. Therefore, when they have fallen off my neck while laying on the ground, they have stayed with me. I lost one pair of the other style when they fell off while working on an RV at a camp ground and did not remember that I had them on. I have used these for a number of phone conversations and have had no complaints that the person on the other end could not hear me.
The only negative that I have thus far is they don't tell you the battery level when you power them on. I forgot to charge them for 3 or 4 days and ran out of battery."

4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My hubby suggested I purchase these. I am so glad I did! I had such a hard time finding the perfect wireless earphones for me because they are either too bulky, or off balanced. Even the most subtle off balanced weight I feel on my neck. These earphones distribute the weight evenly. I don't feel the weight of the volume switch one side. Matter of fact I don't feel it at all because its on the neckband.

The sound is great too! I actually like them better then the top name brand earphones. These are definitely noise cancelling. I don't hear anything when i'm wearing them (so be cautious when you do!). I love it because I stay in the zone and my focus is on point. No sound to distract me, I don't hear others talking, I don't hear the weightlifters grunting or dropping weights, etc.

Love these earphones and highly recommend to those who don't like to feel the weight of the volume switch on one side."

I was looking for another paid of bluetooth headphones to replace another pair that broke, so I decided to give these a try. I had them for a few days now, and so far they are great. Paired easily with my phone, sound quality is nice, and the earbuds fit nicely in my ears. They don't feel heavy and are easy to operate. Only time will tell how long these will last, but I do know I will most likely be using them everyday during my work week for at least 6 hours a day, so I will do a followup review in 30 days. So far I am very happy and I do not have any complaints."

I utilize these at work mostly. They stay in my ears, the quality is great. The distance of range was far greater than I expected. I would highly recommend these earbuds to anyone. The phone connectivity worked when I didn‚Äôt even expect to utilize it. My biggest hurdle was being able to keep them in place, and these earbuds far exceeded that expectation!

I'm not the pickiest when it comes to the quality of sound in earbuds--and I know those who would turn their nose up at these--but it all sounds good to me, plus they cancel out a fair amount of noise and with the neckband they are hard to lose.

5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,It fit nicely to the ear where I can wear it for bicycling and jogging. Light weight and the part that goes around your neck keeps the ear buds from falling out. It also allows for less of a pulling feel in the ear buds. Like they aren't being yanked out of your ears from gravity. The sound quality is decent for a head phone used for exercising. Battery life is satisfying which can survive a week for one hour's exercise per day.

0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was great. Quality sound that is worth more than what is paid. And the neckband helps in that I never felt the earphones slipping out of my ear. With many other Bluetooth headphones, the earphones would slip out of my ear while exercising cause they were the heaviest part of the headphones. The neckband prevented that. The reason for the low rating is longevity. These headphones lasted me less than 5 months before 1 of the earphones stopped working. And I was very careful to take care of them cause I like them so much. I would careful pack them away in a plastic bag before and after each exercise and I would do so in a way that the wires would make a circle. This prevents tangles and preserves the life of the headphones. Despite my efforts, these headphones are not meant to last long in my opinion, which is a shame cause the headphones were perfect in every other way. $15 for 5 months isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôll just buy a more expensive pair with better sound that will last longer."

My one complaint is the volume buttons are also the advance and repeat button for music. You have to hold down the button and the volume is changed before the advance or repeat button is activated.

I do sweat a lot but it has worked without issues. There were probably one instance where the audio would break. The comfort has been good. Have to wear it with wings if you are running or jogging. Battery life is superb. I am not an audiophile but I like the sound from this. It can get loud. Extra 6 months warranty on registering the product is a bonus.

I have a Galaxy S8 and I have not gotten through one song without them cutting in and out multiple times.

When they work the way they should they sound above average forsure but the loss of connection prevent them from being more than a 3 star for me"

8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound for the price! The thicker bar that loops behind the neck keeps it balanced, which is nice when listening with only one earbud on.

5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,2.5 months after purchase won't take a charge anymore. The charge slot is very awkward and sometimes hard to get a good connection. Also the little cover that snaps over the charging slot broke off at about the 3rd or 4th charge
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nice earbuds and very comfortable, however they do not allow you skip/replay music tracks - more specifically - audio books. Great if you mainly use them as a phone headset."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these at the gym primarily. They‚Äôre pretty great I just wish they had a mic for the phone so I could be hands free entirely. Sound quality is pretty good too.
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,The connection is pretty spotty for me. Just having my hand over my phone inside the front pocket of my hoodie is enough to make the sound stutter. For the price though it's not too bad.

3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give it zero stars, It would be appropriate. The people who got their headphones to pair need to consider themselves lucky. The instruction's were completely wrong. It tells you to ""continuously press the MK button until it turns on"" when in reality you hold the MK( Middle Button). As a customer myself, I told myself that the bed reviews were wrong. I asked myself why there were so many good reviews if the product was so bad. As a na√Øve customer, I wasted $18 on a product that cannot be used. I am in the process of returning this faulty product to receive the money they is rightfully mine. I realized for the first time in my life, A product is only as good as it's worst review. Trust me, It's a terrible product."
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Two months after buying them a wire poked through the cord. The lowest setting of volume is still too loud.

0,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,What a big change from wired ear buds! I can move around without dragging my phone around. My hair is long enough to cover one end and I tuck the other end in my blouse. No one knows that I'm listening to music or watching my favorite show! The sound is clear and buds are comfortable in my ear. I will never go back to wired again.

battery works well and last long. sound quality is good."
2,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product so far, been using several days with Moto G5 plus. Perhaps not as much bass as some of my other bluetooth but still excellent overall, clean sound for my ears and very good mike as I use this when I drive or walk to talk on phone. This is better than my other light headsets for overall use to listen and talk. Can't comment yet on total battery life but working great for my use. Very light to wear, I like the magnets to keep earbuds together. No it doesn't fold up or retract but that's inherent in design, knew when I bought it so it's not a downgrade, just part of the design. I'm very satisfied
12/5/17 not working on phone calls, had since August, should be still under warranty, will see how vendor responds."
3,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a single ear blue tooth headphone before but itis so easily get lost in my pocket and it hurts if you wear for too long time. With this one I can wear it all day. No worry to find it anymore.
4,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these yesterday and happy with the sound quality. The built-in mic works well enough for calls; the other party says they can hear me well. However, there is no feedback of my own voice through the ear plugs as I am talking. This is really annoying and distracting as my own voice sounds distant and muffled to me during a conversation even though the other party hears me fine. As such, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them if you intend to use them often for conversations. They do sound pretty good if all you want to use them for is listening to music, books, videos, etc., with the convenience of answering an infrequent phone call.
Hope this helps the next buyer."
5,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing battery life, connects perfectly, good noise-blocking and sound. I actually like these more than the much more expensive Airpods because of the better battery life and not having to worry about losing them. I use them for white noise to sleep and it does the trick (and I don‚Äôt have to worry about choking in my sleep due to wires)."
6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired up to my iPhone 6 instantly and gives me the freedom of moving around without the cord of traditional buds. They fit snugly in my ears and stay that way through my treadmill runs. They do not shake loose or slip out from sweat. And, the biggest bonus is the clear and precise sound quality, great sound from a super affordable set of buds. Highly recommend."
7,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,So I decided it was time to take the plunge and go with digital music instead of my CD's. I know its about time! So I wanted wireless headphones I can use with my phone and iPad. I made the right choice! These are comfortable and easy to recharge. They are simple to use and I like how the magnets turn them into a necklace when I am not using them. No lost headphones or dangling cords. Perfect for me.
8,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my mom and she really likes them! Worth spending another $10 more than the cheaper bluetooth headphones, quality is a lot better and more durable, and the magnets are nice as well."
9,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life was great, 8+ hours of continuous play. Noise blocking was excellent. Hold in ears well. I use for white noise as I sleep because there is always house noises present. Controls and setup are easy. Back neck band is more rigid than parts to ears. While using it I found the neck strap to be kind of annoying, since not I having it I kind of miss it. All Bluetooth headphones that I have used for sleeping in do not last that long, lots of pulling on the cords as I toss and turn. These held up better than most."

6,"Wireless Headphones, Otium X6 Neckband Bluetooth Headphones...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible, absolutely horrible. I bought these so I could do my Yoga and Workout easily without disturbing my partner. Every movement sends the sound into a flurry of distorted noises that sound like an old arcade game. I thought it was my bluetooth device in my computer, so I paired it with my phone. Worked FINE!.....until I went for a walk, again just having the phone in my pocket while listening to music sends it into distorted and jarring noises. I can't even use them, they were a horrible purchase and I am CONVINCED most of these positive reviews are either bots, or planted there because honestly I have no idea how they could run around, clean the house, dance even with the headset on and it NOT devolve into chaos. I'm very unhappy,"

They do not stay in even though they come with 3 earpiece sizes non work perfectly. I bought just to wear around the house and the fall out doing day to day chores, I couldn't imagine using them to work out with. My next big issue is the reception. They cut in and out dropping reception even after moving my phone to my front shirt pocket, only a few inches away. The sound quality is good when you can keep reception and keep the buds in. Sadly my hopes have been crushed, and my set is now in the junk drawer."

I like to wear them around the house while cleaning. If I‚Äôm not using them I just take them out of my ears and they snap together because of magnets on the ear pieces. They are so comfortable I forget that I‚Äôm wearing them! They pair easily with my phone, iPhone. They're light and have the volume & power controls on the right side of the neckband."
