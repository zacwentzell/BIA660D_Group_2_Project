But gave out too early, not even a MONTH.. The case doesnt charge the headset and only one head can be use but is dead already cause cant be charge.

Too bad. Had to buy different earphones (beats)..."
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired with a Note 4.
First attempt to pair the phone failed to find them. I blame that on the phone because it's had a history, just like every Samsung phone I've had this century, of doing that so I turned them off then tried again. This time it found them and after what seemed like a year, finally paired BUT would play for a second, cut out for about 5 seconds, play a second, repeat. I unpaired them, turned off the earbuds, tried again. Within a second, success and they worked correctly.
Medium gels and ear clips (not sure what you call the wings) from the box sounded good, felt great, but no bass. I'm used to this with all in-ear buds so I did my usual change the gels to the large ones but kept the medium clips. Bass is incredible but highs are slightly muddy when using no EQ on the Power Amp music player.
Nose isolation is quite a bit, so much so I couldn't even hear the TV, family, grandchild, barking dogs and other usual noises in my world in the least. Once I turned on music the whole outside world was gone of noise. I definitely will not wear them both when driving as it reminded me of my days of mega way stereo days in my truck (I was one of those folks at a stop light that annoyed the crap out of everyone around}. But I digress
The left bud is the main one that controls everything, limited as the controls are. What I found was to decrease time from power on to listening to music or make a call was power up the left side then in the time it takes to switch what I'm paying attention to and power up the right, the left has connected to the phone, right side about a second later has connected to the left one and they're ready to go.
The only control on the units is power on/off by holding or tap left button to answer/end a call or in music tap either side opens up your voice prompt engine. This is easy to remember, as no clue tap this triple hold that to remember. It's also inconvenient when wanting to change tracks and/or volume without the music device within reach.
Battery life was about 2 hours on the first charge but sometimes lithium ion batteries will increase life between charges after about 3-7 charges by a discernible amount. Time will tell on this.
I didn't write much about the sound quality as that's a personal choice but I did find the medium gels to provide no bass (far too bright) to me and the large a slight bit too much bass (aka muddy) but voices were pretty natural on both.
Volume, again subjective, was plenty for me at just under middle on the phone, I actually prefer it just under that as a maximum when lightning for extended time.
Turn off either side and they both power off. I like that a lot. Powering up just the right one did nothing, this why I stated the left side has the main software and the right is slaved to it.
Since call clarity and all that stuff is also highly subjective I called the Plantronics test line (Google it as I'm not sure I'm allowed to post the actual phone number in a review) and recorded myself. My volume was plenty loud, their volume was loud but I could hear my low volume level television a little in the recording and my voice was very muddy, but understandable.
The fit, as I wrote above, is comfortable. Forget you're wearing them comfortable. They are feather light so they didn't move in the slightest as I tested them jumping up and down, shaking my head, etc. It's rare I find both comfort and no movement when moving around in earbuds. Now when I'm cutting grass and sweating profusely no more cord catching my neck and painfully yanking a bud out of my ear. They almost make me look forward to cutting my lawn on a hot humid day. Almost.
I'd thought briefly about similar buds by the same manufacturer as my phone but the price they wanted it was very brief. With the low asking price and only $3 for a Square Trade warranty extension (I deal with these folks at my job ,selling their product ,and they're easy to deal with and no hassle when trying to actually use the product) I took a shot and I'm glad I did."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say righ off the bat that these are awesome for the price. No, these are not reference audiophile earbuds and for $30 no one should expect them to be. I own a pair of jbird x3, for working out, which cost from $99 to $129 depending on where you buy them. I had to send them in for warranty and wanted something to wireless to use in the meantime so I got these. Wow. I was expecting them to sound like total garbage and was planning to return them once I got my X3s back. There is no way I'm returning these. Yes they are missing some features like volume and track control, but again you can't go wrong for $30 wireless stereo earbuds. I can confirm that they are true stereo as I tested them with some tracks that have crazy right and left channel separation.

Beware though. I would knock off one star as the call quality is horrendous compared to the music sound quality. I was listening to music and decided to place a call. The person on the other line answered. The sound switched over to the left earbud only. The sound was kind of muffled and staticky. Once I ended the call, the music stayed in the left one only and I had to turn the Bluetooth on my phone off and then back on. Once they reconnected all was good.

I didn't knock off the star for the call quality but the music sound quality is really good for the price."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start by saying that I honestly wanted to like these headphones. It's hard to find a solid set of wireless earbuds with decent sound quality and battery life even if you are willing to price up to Apple Airpod levels, so when I found these and I looked over the reviews and specs I was cautiously optimistic. On first glance they're slick looking and fit firmly and comfortably into your ear, and the charger/carrying case is conveniently sized and a great concept. And after charging them, a quick cycle through a variety of different musical genres left me pleasantly surprised by the actually-quite-decent sound quality (the deciding factor in giving them a 2 instead of a 1 star rating).
But the problems became apparent almost immediately. Though advertised as usable with one or both earbuds, only the left earbud actually connects to your device, while the right earbud appears to connect to the left earbud. As such, you can use either both pieces or just the left, but the right is effectively useless by itself (if you, as I do, prefer to have just the right earbud in, or if the left earbud dies). And the battery life is abysmal. I was skeptical when I couldn't find an estimated battery life anywhere in the product description, but shrugged it off when I saw words like ""extended"" and ""surprising"" in the reviews, thinking I would find myself with perhaps a 1 1/2 hour life for each earbud that I could charge with the case while using the other. This is sadly not the case. From full charge to unusable is -maybe- 45 minutes, and as I stated earlier, the right earbud is effectively useless by itself, so when the left one dies, you're out of luck for the two hours it takes to recharge. I make no assumptions about how effective the charging case battery is over time since I only bothered to fully charge the left earbud twice before becoming exasperated, but it was honestly underwhelming when I still had to pull out the regular headset after less than an hour.
I get that there's just not room to pack much battery into headphones this size, but given that this is such an obvious problem making one earbud completely dependant on the other seems like a massive design flaw. I really wanted these to work, but just came out feeling like I had bought a pair of headphones at a gas station."
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:!!!

I returned these because the have terrible range and wont stay connected.( I wrote the review before using them extensively)

these headphones sound freaking amazing! and they fit in my ears perfectly. the box and packaging are terrible.. lol.. very cheap but the case and the earbuds themselves are great quality. the carrying case is the best of all the ones ive used. they fit in it so secure that they wont shake loose. this is really a steal for the price. my only issue is that it doesnt go loud enough for me. i am constantly turning it up. that may just be an issue with me because i like my music loud, but ive noticed none of the new earbuds out go very loud. My old QCY earbuds still are my fave cuz they bump!... These do seal out all the noise around it so maybe the extra volume isnt always needed. it will do an add on to this review after a couple days.

its also a really small carrying case. so well made. they are just a bit bigger than the buds itself. perfect for travel and charging."
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,I was super excited when I ordered these at a reasonable price. I followed the directions and they worked great the 1st time (about 2 hours usage). Then 3 days later I tried them and they would not connect to any devices. I charged them for an hour and per instructions the indicator went off signaling they were charged and I still was unable to connect to devices. Super bummed. Returning them. :(
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pair of headphones on Amazon Prime Day when the price was at a low point and unfortunately have had issues with them charging since they arrived. I charged the case and the buds to full on arrival (film removed from buds as well) and the earbuds do not retain a full 2 hour charge as advertised.

I contacted the company and kindly requested a replacement unit and the response I received was ""We are sorry that we are unable to arrange a replacement for you because the price is for mistake at that time and these cause a lot of loss for us.""

They offered a refund for my price point, but I don't want the small refund, I want a pair of ear buds that work. They sound great when they're actually charged and I had no issues with dropping signal to either earbud, but if they only work for 20 minutes they aren't worth much."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best TWS I have found so far! I have tried many many brands, IOUIOU(tried two different sets!), Parihy, Soundmoov, Losei, QCY, and so on. They all have the same characteristics: right ear cuts in and out, weak connection. They all have good sound quality but very weak signal. Very disturbing to use. This one surprises me as it is not the most expensive one but sounds great and maintains the connection. I wear it while I jogging in my neighborhood and there is not once an interruption. Easy to connect to cell phone. One thing some people may not like about it is the size of the ear buds is the comparable larger than those previous brands. I think this is also why it has strong signals. Battery is a bit short like 2 hours or so depending on how loud you listen to your music. When you buy a set of earbuds, you want to be able to listen to the music without distraction. So far, this is the best."
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I wasn’t sure how well these were going to work with all of the negative reviews. However, I don’t think it’s the excitement of getting a new toy! I have used these to listen to my music on my iPhone 6, and I was blown away! They sound amazing! The only thing I would say is if you have kids or someone else you take care of, make sure somebody else is home with you! These earbuds block ALL outside noise! I only had my volume up halfway and I snapped my fingers next to my ear & couldn’t hear it! I’m buying more of these for Christmas gifts! Absolutely amazing. Oh, they also come with a 1 yr. hassle free warranty & a free 6 month extended warranty! That’s crazy for the price! Love them! Glad I bought them for my early Christmas present! Haha"
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't figure these things out.. When I get them to work the, sound is great. However, I will charge them on the charger and then try to turn them on and it'll connect and 5 minutes later it'll warn me low battery. It also says you can use one while the other is on the charger. But the main earphone is the Left ear and if the left ear is dead I can NEVER get the right ear to connect. They do fit perfectly in your ear and I have been able to workout while wearing them without any problems. Just wish I could figure out how the pairing thing as its not easy to pair with your phone every single time."
10,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped charging less than 2 weeks after I received them.
11,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I I purchased the speaker many guys in the office had the one hanging from the ear which I was not particularly liking so I decided to purchase these and I love them. I received them in 1 day shipping/ the packaging was perfect no problems .They connected to my blue tooth of my Samsung Galaxy S8 with No issues .
The fit Comfortable (You may also we're one Or both )
The sound Quality is great
This Is fine for the price
I would love to see these in tonal/ flesh tone colors
I Am pleasantly surprise and so happy that I purchase these
Now my daughter in husband alsso want a pr these are winners !!!"
12,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just went for a run with them this morning, and I absolutely love these! They stayed in my ear very securely the entire time and didn't slide out from all of my sweat (and trust me, I sweat a good bit). The quality of the sound was great and I would say even better than the Apple earbud quality.
Pairing wasn't an issue at all and was actually way easier than I expected it to be.
The only VERY minor complaint I have is that they do protrude out from your ear some, and although this doesn't bother me a lot, I would like the outside to be just a little bit smaller just for the aesthetic. They still function great and look pretty good in my ears!
Very glad I bought these and amazing what you can get for the price!"
13,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great item and price, purchased to watch netflix and not disturb others, fit is perfect, quick delivery and easy to operate."
14,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The concept of these headphones is great- true wireless, charging case, etc. However, they fall short when actually used- I have 7 sets of bluetooth headphones I use for the gym, so I have a wide experience on fit, sound quality and ease of use. These fit very well and don't fall out, but the problem is that the sound output is very low, even with my phone AND the headphones turned up to max. The left bud is even worse than the right one, as it is maybe 20% quieter. I don't have this issue with any of my other heapldphones, so I can isolate the issue to the Otium ones. I love the fact they they come with a charging case, but it is very hit or miss when it decides to charge. I ended up with no music 2 of the last 3 times I took these to the gym after sitting in the case overnight, only to learn that they didn't charge.
Two stars- marginal for the price."
15,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great for listening to music although they fall out once in a while.

Where they are terrible is for taking phone calls. Every time i use them I get complaints from the other people on the conference call that I sound garbled so I have to go back to my handset. I had much better luck with other products from Ant and Plantronics."
16,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I really like these earbuds as they are truly wireless. Opening the case they came in is fairly easy and getting the earbuds out is also simple. Pairing the earbuds was much easier than expected and is a matter of pushing a button on each one. After placing them in your ear you will notice how well they block out surrounding sounds and they are comfortable to wear although it might take some getting used to. They fit nicely inside the ear and don't fall out or move too much.
The sound quality it's self is very good although for me the volume wasn't loud enough. I had to turn my ipod high while working out and all the way up when mowing the lawn. Charging these is super easy by simply plugging the cord into the back while the earbuds sit inside. Overall, I am super happy with these and recommend them to anyone listening to music."
17,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super easy to pair up with my phone and the sound is very good. Please note only one earbud per order... this earbud is very small but with a powerful sound. There are a couple unique features with this earphone such as being able to pair up with a second mobile phone, you can connect with both phones at the same time and answer calls from one another. You can answer calls, reject incoming calls and end calls including last number redial or hang up current call while receiving another call... You can play music and there's a pause button
This is a super compact little earbud, I can see it coming in handy when you really don't want someone to know you're using headphones... I know for me it might be handy for work purposes.
It came in a very cool little compact black and orange case and included a usb charger, 3 sizes of silicone ear tips and the earbud. The earbud is made to be worn on either the right or the left ear. So super cool little item and I can't wait to try it out more"
18,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bluetooth headphones i have ever had. They are smaller than they look in the picture and stay in place while I workout. From weight lifting, treadmill, elliptical or biking they do not fall out. Battery life has lasted me a 3 hour bike ride. I love that the case is also a power bank capable of charging them about 3 more times before needing to be plugged in."
19,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"1 - Literally garbage
2 - You can find better
3 - Solid, maybe during a sale
4 - Good purchase
5 - There is literally no better version of this

These headphones are good; great, even. I buy a lot of headphones of all varieties and these genuinely surprised me with their quality. If I could go fractional, I'd go higher than a 4, but there are a few things that keep them from being a 5 in my opinion.

Good:

*Great price
*The case they come in charges the headphones.
*The fit is excellent; both the inner-ear plug and the concha bowl flare are separately interchangeable, so these will fit any ear.
*Sound quality is very nice, even before any ""burn-in"". I wasn't expecting much from the low ranges, but they genuinely surprised me. I think the benefits of Bluetooth V4.2 shine through here.

Bad:

*The only functional button is in a bad place: right on the center. I didn't find it comfortable to push the headphones into my ear with the force it took to depress the button, so it practically removed the convenience of one-finger operation. I'd rather have seen the button on the top or bottom of the earpiece so that you could press it with a pinching action instead of a pressing. On the same subject, not much is done with the function button. I'd either like to have seen more buttons for more function, or more creative things done. I've had single-button headphones that have separate uses for a short press, a long press, a double short press, a triple short press, etc. These are just start/stop.
*With the largest earpieces attached, there are issues fitting the headphones into the case. Mine are such a tight fit, it inverts the plug every time I try to remove them, no matter how gently. The concerns this brings to mind are faster wear on the soft plug and getting it stuck in the case if I try to remove it too fast and the plug gets ripped off the headphone.

---

TL;DR: These are really nice, especially for the price. Minor issues you could easily overlook keep it from being five stars."
20,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Came as a Christmas gift and worked perfectly.
21,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless ear buds are actually quite amazing. I was worried they would stay put but they are made just the right size and fit my ears perfectly. I wasn't too sure what the correct placement was so I just kept adjusting them until they felt comfortable for me.

I'm thankful that the instructions were so clear because I would have never thought to turn on each ear without them. I love that you can listen with one ear at a time or both.

That makes things easy for me when I want to listen to music or take calls but also need to be able to hear what's going on around me or with the kids.

The volume was great for these earbuds. I think the best part of all is that you simply place them back in t he ir case and plug the case to the charger. That makes it a lot easier than trying to plug each bud in. The case also keeps it safe and protected if you are on the go or simply don't want to lose them. These are highly recommended."

54,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these with the preconceived notion that I was not going to like them. My ears are pretty weirdly shaped, or at least that's the excuse I use. Earbuds never stay in my ears or they stay in and hurt. I expected nothing less from these. However, who can pass up on the chance of going for a run and not having wires bobbing around or big clunky sweaty headphones. Who knew that wireless headphones were what I have been missing my whole life? To start, I thought I was an IT tech and could pair them without using the manual. Nope, not I. Once I actually read the instructions I was paired and ready to go in no time. Sound quality was very good. I'm sure $200+ headphones would sound .01% better, but who needs to spend that money? They fit in my ears and never slipped out, not even during my run. It comes with multiple interchangeable ear pieces to find the perfect fit. On another positive note, the headphones muffled all of the environmental sounds around me. They come in a case that when docked they are charged through it with a micro usb plug in the back. So, now my goal is to make sure they are always kept in the case and not loose them! If that is the only flaw, I'll take it."

Reduces noise, and it's absolutely silent in the background when listening to an audio book. Music play back is literally HD. However, I took off a star because it sounds atrocious for phone conversations and the other party barely can hear me, or not at all. The charging case is perfect to carry around the ear phones safely. They sit amazingly well in my ear, don't move, and create a barrier to external noise.

It's my first time using wireless earbuds, it turns out my decision is right. The charging case leaves a deep impression for me, and I really enjoy the great sound quality of the earbuds. What surprises me most is that I can share the earphones with my cousin. We go outside a lot and spend a lot of time taking subway. We won't be bored during that time. I'm really fortunate that I choose it."

I really hate wasting my money. And I highly recommend that NOBODY purchase this product.

They would have been used more."

116,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These are definitely bass heavy and lack any high range. Take one earpiece out and its almost as if the highs are random static tones. Midranges are tight. The major redeeming factor for these are the many earpieces and hooks. They fit great. I haven't had them long enough to review the battery lifespan but will update once I have a better idea.
117,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very tiny and music sounds ok for the price, but while on a call it's terrible, volume is very low and you can only hear through the left earbud, I bought this for use at work and to be able to make my daily phone calls and it's not going to work."

I accidentally dropped one getting out of my car and I didn't realize I had until I couldn't find it well let me tell you this sucker lasted in the parking lot got wet from rain and being in the sun and it still worked!!! I found it today and it works like normal the only downside is they could last longer but then again I'm using them for hours straight not so the battery life is pretty good

It is very easy to pair to my samsung phone ,fit my ears very well,long battery ,I have been used it for 2 days now without charging it, the good thing about these earphones is it comes 2 ear buds and can be connect to 2 different device,I can connect one to my cell phone and the other to my I pod to listen music . it a great features.
Highly recommended."
122,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are so comfortable and have amazing sound! They even have a little charging/storage box that I can toss in my purse instead of them being dropped and lost in the bottom of my purse. You can wear one or both. Charge quickly. Have attachments to change out to make it more comfortable for your ear shape. I wore one in my left ear when I went walking with my son so I could still hear him and out surroundings. Definitely worth the money!

Pros: bluetooth technology
cost
Cons: Too large for my ears (I'm female so maybe that impacts fit. 2 guys found the size ok)
Held a charge for less than 2 hours"

Received the second set and they work perfectly. I wear them when I run. I have been caught in a couple really hard rains & they have given me perfect service. I have never used them for over around 90 minutes, but they have never lost charge while I have been using them. Sound quality is excellent and the design will not allow them to fall out of your ear."

127,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset is very cool and nice bass to boot, also this one qualifies as Otmos Dolby compatible, just knowing that will already make you jump on this headset. The only reason it’s 4 stars is because the battery after charging don’t hold out for long max or 2 hours , enough for gym and one movie. But still a great buy!"

Update: Used one of these headphones all day at work today. It only lasted about 2 hours. So, I switched it out for the other one and put the first one back in the charger. I need to have one ear open at work at all times. Switching off allowed me to use these all day. Good stuff!!"

Therefore, it was important for me to choose the comfort and convenience for my ears headphones. These headphones are very comfortable and compact, and after charging they work long enough. They hold even very long flights or trips, always fit in any pocket and even easy to clean. I recommend this little pleasant find to everyone."

The 1rst pair I sent back because the earphone's battery died and it will not take a charge. It lights up, shows its charging but then is still dead. The 2nd pair I ordered are going back today for the exact same reason. If they worked they would be nice because they fit the ear very well. An hour of listening time upon arrival and then they are dead and never work again just isn't going to cut it for $29..........a few days later, I'm in to edit my review........I've kept these earphones a few more days in hopes that I can figure out how to make them keep a charge longer than 15 minutes. Nope! They are truly just a set of earphones that can only be used for short minutes at a time between hours of charging. It's stunning that a product like this is even legal to advertise and sell in the USA. Garbage! Complete garbage!"

132,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Super affordable.
- Come in their own case. I charged the case to charge these.
- Comes with quite a few silicone earbuds.
- Lightweight
- Cannot hear anyone around me when fully inserted. Almost sound proof.
- Can charge the case and that can charge the earphones. Works like a battery pack for these.

Cons:
- Slight distortion in the sound, gets more audible when volume is high.
- Feels a bit uncomfortable in the ear because of the design.
- No volume buttons.
- Charging lasts for 2 hours. I use one at a time, so thats 4 hours."
133,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are decent looking, and fit nicely for the gym, but the sound quality is poor. The bass is nice and the volume is loud without too much distortion, but there is an underlying static/scratch sound behind every song. I purchased two pairs and tried both to make sure it wasn't a defective set. Both operated the same way, underlying static. If you aren't picky about sound quality, these would be fine. I have an older set of BT headphones I was hoping to replace, but they still work and sound better than these."

You probably think apple AirPods are too expensive priced at $160 so you're looking for a cheap true wireless alternative.

Sound - 3/10

147,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed. First of all, the product is falsely advertised. It has no noise canceling technology, apart from the fact that the earpieces are so big that they block some of the noise. Aesthetically, the product does not look good, it is too big and stands out of the ear. Most importantly, the headphones are hard to pair, mostly due to the fact that the battery last very little, in my case less than 2 hours with full charge. This was a very bad deal. If you looking to buy noise canceling headphones to study you are better off buying some earbuds..."

While I'm at work I only use one earbud (so that I can hear my coworkers), so I thought I'd switch to the right earbud while the left one was charging. Apparently only the left earbud does the Bluetooth pairing, so I have to wait and only use the left earbud at work.

Fits great in my small ears though!"

If you switch out the eartips for FOAM ear tips it won't fit the case, you have to force it in there.
Volume are Excellent quality, but it Maximum isn't too loud.
Have to power them both separately each time, and it could be better if it snugs your ear."

They hook to bluetooth very easy and are just a pleasure to own I recommend theses to all my friends and family you will too.FIVE STARS for the true wireless earbuds they are the best.you will be so incredibly happy with these you will want to do what I'm going to do and give them as gifts to everyone for every occasion. The sound quility is something you will not believe, you feel like you are at a concert with the b and right in front of you .I just can't say eno ugh about these earbuds .If you wear both they block all outside sound so all you hear is the music or book or phone call you listening to, Like I said these are the very best earbuds you will ever own with the sound quality better then bose, trust me you will love them as much as I do.

I purchased a set and it worked great for a week then stopped charging. I reached out to the company and they promptly sent me a replacement in the mail. That set was decent for quite some time but just recently it took a dump on me. The earbuds do not hold charge. I've charged them for hours and only get about 20-30 minutes before they start beeping then shut off. The companies page claims they have a 1 year warranty on their products and that they get back to you in 24 hours but I have reached out twice now without a response. I held myself from making this review hoping they would reach out and make it right but they haven't and it doesn't seem like they will. I guess you get what you paid for with these. I am not sure how they got such good reviews (well I am sure considering most Amazon reviews are fake) If you want quality, spend some money. If you want throw aways, i'm sure there are other sets out there for the same price that last longer."

These earphones have no cords or anything which I like. I don't like the cord hanging off anywhere on me when I workout and these earphones enable me to do that
-super easy to install and connect to my phone
-they fit it my ears perfectly, not a lot of noise canceling earbuds fit my ears
- the volume can go up pretty high
- keeps the noise out

156,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching far and wide for a cost effective solution to running headphones. I will see that this mission began years ago when wireless headphones hadn't been invented yet. I used to hate running with ear buds. They would pop out and the cost would pull. I tried over the ear and behind the head and nothing fit the bill. Then I started looking at wireless headphones.

Now I should give a little background on how much I run and how often. I started out a year and a half ago wanting to run a 10k in 7:30 miles or faster. In July I began training and could only run maybe 1 mile at around 10:00 or so minutes. By thanksgiving I ran my 10k at 7:30 miles and now I am running much more. My hope this year is to run the 10k in less then 7:00 miles, but in addition I have added a lot of distance. I generally run around 20-25 miles a week and this year I will have run over 1,000 miles. I go on long runs that can be over two hours and as long as 15 miles. I only say that to give you some reference regarding my usage.

I would like to say that I don't care about the audio quality of the headphones within reason. I care about durability, fit, and functionality. The audio quality is just a bonus.

Little did I know that this would become a long and painful process. I will give you all my experience step by step in hopes of eliminating some of the pain and suffering that I endured flushing out all of my different options.

The very first set I tried were these Mpow headphones Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sport Headphones Sweatproof Running Gym Exercise Headsets-Nature Green. It turned out that they were a little bit bulky and heavy right around the ear. This weight isn't much of an issue under normal usage, but between the weight and the wire and thousands of running strides they would shake lose and fall out. FAIL!

Having had some stability issues I decided to try something just a little different Anear Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds for Sport Running Gym Exercise Sweatproof CVC 6.0 Noise-Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earphones Microphone Compatible with iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5 5c 5s 4 and Android--Black & Green. This set was similar, but it had an extra piece that I had hoped would provide me some more stability in my ear. Unfortunately the little extra piece that is attached to the bud did absolutely nothing to increase the stability and they would also fall out while I was running. FAIL!

So then I looked around and found the next logical step forward TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones Wireless In Ear Earbuds Sports Sweatproof Earphones with Built in Mic (Cordless 4.1, Secure Ear Hooks Design, 7 Hours Play Time). These would definitely stay in place and in fact they did. These gave me a false sense of success. I really liked these headphones, but over time I found the wire running behing my neck was a bit of an annoyance. That wasn't enough to drive me away from the headphones, but when they stopped charging I had no choice. I wanted to find the perfect headphone and not one that was just good enough. The constant bouncing of the wire, even though it came with a little clip, drove me to look for something better. FAIL!

I must admit that this set of headphones was just a bad idea on my partBluetooth Headphones RIVERSONG Sweatproof Wireless Stereo Earphones Noise Cancelling Headphone Headset with Mic for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and Android Phones (Black). In retrospect the lessons I learned earlier should have told me these wouldn't work, but I guess something made me think the smaller earbuds would be lighter and might not shift around as much. Unfortunately these were a very fast FAIL! The wire with the charging port in a little pod along the length is never a good idea for running. The momentum your running stride provides this piece will yank the bud out faster then you could stop and catch it as it falls to the ground. FAIL!

Finally I decided that the wire was an issue and had to go. With that in mind I entered the world of truly wireless headphones SoundPEATS Wireless Earbuds, True Wireless Stereo Bluetooth 4.2 Headphones Cordless Earphones Sweatproof In-Ear Headset with Mic, Secure Fit for Sports. Down the rabbit hole I went into chinese manufacturers rebranding and fake reviews. I really liked these headphones until the right now stopped charging after about 2 months. I got a replacement set and the left one did the same. I think the sweat was just too much for them to handle. I will also say that I wasn't terribly pleased with the customer service from these folks. FAIL!

Now that I did have a wire between the headphones to worry about I felt like maybe smaller would be better Mpow True Wireless Earbuds, V4.1+EDR Bluetooth Headphones with Magnetic Charging Box, Mini Stereo Bluetooth Earpiece Hands Free Headset Sport Earbuds w/ Mic. I tried these, but they just didn't say in my ears very well. Additionally I struggles with some connection issues. If I turned my head from left to right I would intermittently lose connection between the two headphones. Being that I run on the street/sidewalk I needed to be able to turn my head so I decided I needed something with better connectivity. FAIL!

Now these are a little gem Cobble Pro True Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth V4.1 In-Ear Earphones, Mini Twins Headphone Headset with Mic & Charging Carrying Case, Noise Cancelling & Sweatproof for Apple iPhone X/8/7/8 Plus, White. I really like these heardphones. Now after about 3 months the right one became really quiet, but the customer service was great and they sent me a new set. They didn't even make me return the old ones. The next set worked well for a while and then I must have jossled the magnet inside the left ear piece because it wouldn't sit on the charger correctly anymore. In general though they worked really well. The biggest issue I had was the right earpiece not staying in place. In fact it become common for me to simply pull it out and put it in my pocket during a run. NOT Fail! ALMOST THERE!

The mission now become to find a headphone with the same capabilities as the Cobble Pro's, but with more stability. That's what led me to regress back to the behind the ear design True Wireless Earbuds, DAVIKERY Bluetooth V4.2 Headphones HD Stereo Sound IPX5 Sweat & Water Proof Earphones with Mic for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets - Black. I will keep this simple. They were nice for about 2 weeks and then they straight up stopped working. I think the design of the battery in the ear hook simply provided too much opportunity for moisture to get into the earpiece and killed them. EPIC FAIL! One of the worst sets for sure.

Now I just needed to find a new set without the batteries in the earhook Bluetooth Headphones SMARTOMI Gee True Wireless Earbuds Sport Earphones In Ear with Mic Bluetooth 4.2 Sweatproof Noise Cancelling Cordless Headset Running Sport Gym Soft Earhooks (Upgraded Version). These fit the bill, but unfortunately had MASSIVE connection issues. I didn't even get out of the house before these ones went back in the box. The ear pieces couldn't consistently stay connected to each other with me walking around the house. I wasn't going to even try going for a run. EPIC FAIL!

Maybe I needed something a little more Sporty Wireless Earbuds, NEXGADGET True Wireless Bluetooth V4.2 Headphones Sweatproof Cordless Sport Earphones Twins Stereo Headset with Mic for iPhone iPad and Most Android Phones. Flat out I just couldn't get these to fit right. I don't know if it is the flexible/moldable ear hook, or what it was, but they would not stay in my ear. FAIL for me!

FINALLY, that led me to the promised land. Now I write this review with a heart full of hopes and dreams that I am finally at the end of my journey, but I will admit that I am cautiously optimistic. I have gone on a slow recovery run and also a fast 6:45 min/mile 4.7 mile run. Usually my faster runs include more jostling and are worse for stability and the longer runs are worse for moisture. I haven't gotten in a really good long run yet, but the design provide me hope that water will stay out of this better. The small hook piece that goes inside your ear does a tremendous job providing the additional stability needed. They are really secure in my ears, use standard sized ear pieces (unlike the Cobble Pros) and sound pretty good. I gave these 5 stars and I hope that they stay that way. I will update this review as I learn more."

Only one side will work even when trying to use for dual listening. Additionally, the noise reduction isn't working. I got constant complaints about the background noise or inability to hear me. Wished I could have returned!!!"
159,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the box and within an hour one ear piece fell apart.

I charged them, changed the size of the airwings to fit my ear and listened to music for about 15 minutes. When I changed one of the air wings, the piece that goes into the ear fell off. I put it back on. I checked the other bud, and the ear insert was attached well. Then I put them back into their case for storage. I could not get the case to close. I took out one ear bud to look closer to see if I was putting it in the right way and see why the lid wouldn't close, and the entire insides came out. And I was gentle with them.

With only the one ear bud that was fine, I still cannot get the case to close or the receptors to line up for charging.

I'm so very disappointed. They seem to be great for everyone else. :("
160,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the first couple off weeks I've loved using this headphones. I used them for running and when I was working out. However as of the third week after arrival, the headphones make a scratch sound every 30 seconds, like the speakers are blown out."
161,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice product. I hated the fact only device worked on a call. yes -- it is kinda cool that you could stream the call to one device and music to another device but that isn't what I wanted. If you look at the manufacturers website -- they clear state that fact right off-- so kudos to their website. Amazon choose to bury that information into the specifications. That is why I returned it. If you are looking for that feature to only use one device -- it is a great product. But if you are like me, want both earpieces working on a call -- look for an another device.

I give the manufacturer and device an 5 star but I give Amazon a 1 start for burying that information."
162,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had these earbuds for two days but my initial impressions are very good. I ordered wireless earbuds from the startup Kanoa almost two years ago and they still haven't been produced and shipped to me so I wanted to get some inexpensive wireless earbuds specifically for the gym. For $30 these have been great. I'm not an audiophile but I am happy with the bass, the overall sound, and the ease of use.
I've read that most people get about two hours of play time with these which is more than enough for me since I go to the gym on my lunch hour and won't need more than 45 minutes at a time. Some of the other reviews seemed repetitive and not very well written so I wasn't sure if they were genuine but now that I have these earbuds I can honestly say I am happy with this product so far.
UPDATE: I've had a few more days to use these earbuds and I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because I experienced some connection issues when using this product while playing a solo round of golf. I was listening to music from a smartwatch which I wear on my right wrist (I'm left-handed). I was using a pull-cart while golfing and when I used my right hand to pull the cart my hand would trail behind me and the connection would fail. I ended up just pulling the cart with my left hand for the rest of the round and the connection issue was solved. I'm guessing the left earbud handles the pairing with my smartwatch, so it probably just disconnected when the watch and earbud got too far away from each other. Not a deal breaker, but notable."
163,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok...may be too early to tell, BUT....I have a pair of QCYs and right out of the box, these OTIUMS are easily TWICE the sound quality. Maybe my QCYs were knockoffs because I have had quirky issues with them. I am enjoying tunes right this moment on the OTIUM set and quality is really better. The price is also much better. Although they are bigger and they do have the little silicone ear hook on them, they are definitely a great product. I know these won't fall out of my ears like the QCYs. Don't get me wrong, I do like the QCYs, especially since they were the intro to my true wireless experience....but I think the OTIUMS just beat them out. Now, this is my first day and this review may be updated...hopefully only for the good!"
164,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these headphones I use them when I go for my morning jog. they actually stay in my ear when im running and i don't have to be afraid of them falling out. I also like the charging station/case it comes with and don't have to worry about plugging a annoying wire into the headphone just pop them in the case and they start charging. Love these would recommend.
165,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for almost a week and I have found they they have good sound and I like the case that you charge them in. The cons are: I don't like that when you remove them from case the one on the right goes in the left ear and vice versa, very counter intuitive. I had to change out the earbud covers for the small ones, which was fine. And I had to take off the ear hooks, they seem to serve no purpose for my ears. Also, they do not keep a charge for an entire work day either, barely half a day. I start using them around mid-morning, turn them off for lunch and by 2:30 or 3:00, they are beeping because they need another charge. I guess I will have recharge during my lunch hour. I did not have to do that with my other bluetooth earbuds."
166,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Really liked thiese while they lasted. Have had for about 6 weeks and they were easy to use and pretty good sound. Unfortunately the charging box doesn't work and I can no longer charge them. Super disappointed that they lasted for such a short period of time. Do not recommend unless you have back up headphone.
167,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was admittedly skeptical when I ordered these as I have traditionally been a name brand nerd. That being said these may have helped me turn a corner overall in that regard as I have absolutely nothing but praise for these earbuds. No issues connecting to myriad devices, great sound quality, outstanding durability (a full cycle through the washing machine and dryer), and most of all extremely comfortable! I have deleted bookmarks for buds from Sony, Samsung, and Beats at upwards of $200 because sans a back massage and a home cooked meal there is no way any of those warrant the premium price tag and would be hard pressed to win a Pepsi challenge straight up against these gems!"
168,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off I like the earbuds design and fit and they sound great, only problem is mine seem to only last 20min on a full charge. Update- company contacted me and sent me replacement they work perfectly"
169,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound and fit from these earbuds. I bought these as a trial to see if I would like true wireless earbuds. These have convinced me that I do. Good ""noise canceling"". Not fond of the charging system. Earbuds won't charge when charger is plugged in so, you have to charge the charger first then place the earbuds in to charge them. If your earbuds are dead, and the charger is dead, it takes quite awhile to get the earbuds charged. The charger does not turn off after the earbuds are charged. This means that, if you place your dead earbuds in the fully charged charger to charge them, and you leave them in for an extended period, the charger goes dead. So, you can't store them in the charger beyond the charging time and expect to get more than 1 charge. Overall a good product just need to work on a couple things. I would not buy again but, if you are on the fence about getting true wireless earbuds, I feel these are a good initial buy because the price is right and you get very good sound."
170,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just go to the gym, first use the Bluetooth headset, began to think that wearing instability, no such situation was very stable, and the sound quality is also very good! Put it in a small box, charge it, and don't lose it!"
171,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are mostly pretty awesome. They fit in your ear perfectly and you can go 2-3 days before having to charge the case. It's nice that the buds light up so you for sure know they are charging.
But man the directions are super confusing. It took me a LONG time to figure it out. And I am still lost on some parts which is pretty frustrating. But otherwise very nice and a good deal!"
172,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ear buds for bass lovers, good connection comfortable to wear didn't ever fall out of my ears the only con I would say would be Battery Life around 2 hours Of battery life. So if your willing to sacrifice good sound quality with good strong bass I would say these are the ones to get but if you need something that goes all day without having to sit and wait for it to charge up these aren't for you"
173,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these with plans to use them for a long overseas flight. I was excited on the first use because after years of disappoint from earbuds that wouldn't stay in my ears, they fit perfectly. The sound was OK but for the price, I didn't complain. The pairing process with my Android phone was a bit kludgy, but eventually I got that sorted out too. I found that I was able to get about 2 hours of use they needed a recharge. Then, after about 10 hours of total use, the right bud stopped working. The indicator light flashes, but it will no longer pair with my phone, ipad or Macbook."
174,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. I use mine to listen to music while i walk. I use them when I am cleaning or cooking so I can jam out to my favorite music anytime and the best part is that they are truely wireless so no more finding mommy tied up with her earphones. lol plus they also qiet down when I get a notification sound or a call so I do not miss anything.

The headphones aren't that loud, the life of the headphones are horrible, and from my experience they very difficult to pair with my devices. These are my fourth pair of bluetooth headphones, but the main selling point of these are that they are truly wireless. The truly wireless part is the most convenient part of this product, but I don't find that giving up sound quality and battery life are a good trade off from a convenience factor. Overall, they aren't horrible but they are not that good either."

218,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just got them out of the box and they are amazing! The headphones are easy to pair and they are comfy while staying secure in my ear. Even tried out pairing just one and it works like a charm. I am very happy with my purchase!
219,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound. Be sure to remove plastic off back of each bud to charge fully initially.
220,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Sound is excellent and they last a long time on a single charge
221,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,product was defective. Right side would not charge.
222,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Music sounded good and came through both ear pieces. Phone audio was entirely too low and only came through one ear piece even though both were used. Never could get them to automatically pair with my phone.

225,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage! Would give negative stars. They don't work separately. Don't charge correctly. Never had a full battery. People hear static when talking on phone. Will never purchase another otium product.
226,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Good sound"" when playing music. Relatively loud stereo sound when playing music and movies .Very comfortable in ear with a good range of fittings .Really convenient charging/carrying case . The only thing I can say is alittle disappointing is the fact that u can only make calls from the left earpiece and when making calls it's not extremely loud based on my individual hearing opinion, which might effect some users who work around heavy machinery or loud noise. But other than that it's a great item for the price I'm definitely going to recommend these to friends and family who are looking for an affordable pair of quality wireless earbuds also they'd make an awesome affordable gift Thanks!!!!"
227,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage. They don't charge after using the for two days. Sound is subpar, as well"

I find these on Amazon and liked what they looked. I read the reviews and decided to order these true wireless headphones..
These are exactly what I am looking for!! They are lightweight, comfortable and easy to travel with!!
The charging case charges quickly and easily fits in my bag.
These earbuds have a real low profile and actually look really amazing. Recommend!"
230,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,All I can say is it’s bad ass. I love to see a company put the customer before profit and put out a great product to compete with high end companies at a much better price. I can’t see anyone not living theses they are fantastic go ahead push the buy button you will be glad you did.
231,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, I use them at night when I am going to bed and I want to listen to some relaxing music or do some meditation. these actually rally stay in my ears well even though there is no cord connecting them. I like that both ear buds charge at the same time. these ear buds really are a good product I am very happy with them."
232,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 2 sets of the ear buds as gifts purchased early before I needed them because I had the money available. Now they've been wrapped and given and one set it is so hard to hear or be heard. Too much background noise comes through so other party can't hear you. Can't return and have to purchase another gift. Highly disappointed
233,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Otium T2 wireless sport stereo earphones is one of the best I have ever purchase and used. I have many sets of headphones but this set is my first wireless earphones and it come with a case that charges them when not in use. The sound quality for this earphones is totally amazing you even can hear the background noise. They are super easy to pair and one of most unique about this earphones is it can pair two devices at the same time ""each side earphone can be used separately"" . I would definitely recommend to anyone for the price where is at is a totally worth item to buy.
Anyone who see my review. Please give me opinion "" click helpful "" If not please leave a comment thank you"
234,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones don't have that much battery life as promised, they only last about an hour on a full charge and at medium volume, audio quality isn't that exciting either, I tried the three optional sizes and audio doesn't improve, I do like that they won't fall off my ears even on a long run but the short battery life is a disappointment, considering returning."
235,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are the nice bluetooth headphones earbuds and I would definitely recommend them.

Con: Power for each side is about 1.5 hours.

Generally, I still love this product due to great sound quality and invisibility. It super worth my money."
237,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight and compact, fits easily in pocket even inside of charging case. Case charging headphones is amazing and helps keep them charged a lot more than if they had to be plugged in. They fit comfortably for hours and come with multiple pieces you can use to fit different ear types. They have excellent noise cancelling quality. Ordered a second pair for my wife after receiving mine!"
238,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are super-nice. They sync easily, they are very comfortable, and the build quality seems pretty good. For running, I like of course to have both in. I also like the ability to use either right or left alone listening to podcasts around house. Bluetooth 4.2 seems more stable than 4.1, and I haven't experienced the kind of cut-outs that I am used to with other wireless headphones. I've tried a number of bluetooth earbuds, and these are my favorites so far."
239,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that I can take these earbuds on the road without having to worry they will run out of battery. The case is also a charging station, and can recharge it up to 3 times! And no wires! Perfect for my IPhone 7. High quality for a low price. Amazing"

243,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are awesome. It's easy to pair with my phone. Each earbud was small and come with different size earpieces and were black. As for the fit, these headphones do a well job, they don't seem tottering at all and they stay in place.They are really light and feel very comfortable to wear. Each piece can be paired alone as well !"

259,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side won't connect (right ear piece), hard for callers to hear you."
260,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"When these things are used correctly, they sound great! The charging case is awesome, and does give me 2-3 full charges before I need to recharge the case itself. That's plenty of time for a couple flights + time to the hotel, which is exactly what I wanted. They fit well, and it's nice that they include several different sized ear fitments. The sound quality is awesome, they fit snugly and safely, and I didn't notice any fatigue from wearing them for several hours.

On the down side, these things are finicky as heck when you're trying to juggle one or both of them. Despite instructions (which are mediocre at best) and comments here, you almost have to re-pair these to use one or the other, depending on the situation. Like you start with both paired and the music playing and then one starts to die (battery), so you drop that one back into the charger and just use one. But now it doesn't want to work by itself, so you have to pair it again. And then when the first one is charged again, you need to re-pair BOTH to get them to work in concert. It's frustrating and annoying, but somehow, it's still worth it. I hate having cords laying around, stuff hanging on my neck, etc., so the hassle of pairing and re-pairing is tolerable for now. Someday it won't be, and I'll jettison these, but for now, it's okay. My second gripe is battery life. I don't think I've managed to get three hours on either ear piece. Maybe two hours, or 2.5 hours max. I really wish they lasted longer. If they DID last longer, then the whole issue with pairing becomes somewhat moot, as I won't have to do it as often. If someone comes out with a pair of these with a six hour battery life, then I'm all in, and these are toast.

Oh, the case is a bear to open when the ear pieces are charging. Which I guess is good, because you don't want to lose them, but just note it takes a fingernail to pry that sucker open. Finally, when you consider the COST for these things, well, they just can't be beat!"
261,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but the mic on the device is not that great."
262,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"they came in a very great case, it just the sound wasn't loud enough for me"
263,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The microphone quality is so poor that it is not realistic to use as a headset for conversation. Sounds like the user is in a tin box down the hall.
Sound/speaker quality was OK though."
264,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I haven't ever been able to get earbuds to fit right. These fit perfectly out of the box. Comfortable, light, and seals out enough noise to make it feel like noise canceling.

2. These are hands down the BEST sounding, clearest, ACTUAL stereo, and deep bass headphones I've ever had, even Monster headphones aren't this good.

I love everything about these, and I haven't actually ever loved a headphone before. And they're actually wireless, no connector between the two of them. If you aren't sure, buy these. More expensive ones aren't needed."
265,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is more than reasonable. The case is super cool, it has a little battery and charges the headphones when its not plugged in. they are comfortable and stay in your ear. However, these do have some issues staying sync'd, especially in areas with a lot of interference causing electronics and crowded areas, these have zero low end, terrible battery life (about 2 hours). I wouldn't purchase these again, however I don't regret purchasing them the first time."
266,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had bought a pair of these a long time ago. They are so worth the purchase. Hands free driving covered. Listening while cooking no problem. Listening to music while house cleaning cleaning was done faster.
267,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very surprised these worked as good as they do way cheap for the amount of sound and battery life. I go on 2hr runs with these they are very comfortable, no ache in my ears like some ear canal headphones. Very light very responsive."
268,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this set of wireless headphones for my husband. He is very satisfied with this headphones so far. The sound quality is good. And it is very convenient to have wireless compared to wire headphone.
269,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones I use them when I commute in the morning and afternoon on the walk to and from the train. They will actually stay in my ear and i am not worried of them falling out. I also like the charging station/case it comes with and don't have to worry about plugging Directly into the headphone just put them in the case and they start charging. Wish on next generation they work on battery life. I have recommended these to family, friends and coworkers."
270,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was impressed with the concept and the charger, until I tried to open the charger cover to remove the units. I had to pry it open with a tool and it still will not open easy. The units do not seem to hold a pairing, as I have had to pair them several times. I use them for TV late at night, often they get out of sink and I get a delay between the two units. Will give them a try at the gym with my phone. I wish my hearing aids charged like these......"
271,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"They are JUNK! I have used them 4 times and they stay ""working"" for 10 -15 min then says pairing lost. After pairing them once again they will work for 10-15 min. then they are done and back for a recharge.
Please don't waste your money like I did spend 10-20$ more and get a good pair!"
272,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"2 things I don't like about it
1. When talking to someone via these earbuds, you kind of have to talk loud for the person to hear. Also that only 1 side works for calling, not both sides of the earbuds.
2. The sound is great, but it is not very loud. If you wanted to blast in your ear, it doesn't do that.

Otherwise, the earbuds are pretty good. They stay in my ear perfectly. They drown out all the sounds around me. Connecting to my phone is very easy."
273,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This earphone is comfortable to wear smaller and have Bluetooth and the box can be charged and the sound quality very nice is perfect earphone thank u my man

Great value for that price."

276,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"After charging fully I paired them up but they did not sustain the connection if I walked away more than 10 ft or moved my hand close to the earphones. They were not a good fit either. The right one would lose synch with the left one. Lastly, all the praise about its sound quality is unjustified"
277,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returning this. People can't hear me very well, I tested several times and with different people. Also too big for my ears. I thought the other kind I bought before this was bad ... this is worse."

279,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The reason I bought it is due to the absence of wires and the price. Searched for same brand and the with wires are similar price. There is a lot of chemical smell, but I kept it aerated and it is better. Sound quality is good for the price."
280,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, I bought an Airpod for my wife. I have to admit that it is very cute and the sound quality is so amazing. But I think it isn’t worth the price. So I bought this cheap one online for myself. The earbuds work fantastic!

281,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless earbuds took a bit extra time to figure out for setting up and have only about one hour's worth of use time.

283,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair. Bass is great sound is good. 4 stars because the pairing with something is very slow and complicated, the button on the Bluetooth can only play or pause, should have added multitaps to skip and repeat, and battery is OK but considering the size it's to be expected."
284,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for several months. I wore them at work in my office for a week to try them out. The sound quality is great, but the battery only last about an hour in a half to 2 hours and takes longer to charge than you have listening time. I constantly had trouble pairing the ear buds to my S8. I haven't used this product in weeks, I feel like it was a waste of money."

287,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was thinking about buying some Bluetooth headphones that were in the 200-300 dollar range. But I figured why not try out a cheaper pair first. These are awesome for the price; they fit well and sound great. I'm sure the battery lasts longer on the more expensive pairs but these are perfect for my hour workout sessions.

298,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,The product information is miss leading. It states that the earbuds can be synced with 2 devices at the same time. That is only possible by syncing 1 bud to a device and the other to a different device. I have two different BT earbuds that are connected that I can sync with a S7 and iPod touch at the same time listening to the iPod and switching to the S7 for calls.

But the left ear bud stopped putting out sound after 5 days of using them. The LED indicated it was connected, but there was no sound coming out. Really disappointed."
314,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great except the battery dies very quickly.
315,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about these except the battery life. I am getting 1 hour and 40 minutes per charge and it takes almost that long to charge them. They sound, fit and otherwise work well. If another generation comes out with MUCH better battery life I might purchase them again."
316,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the product. It's a great buy.
317,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Trouble with both staying synced and only 5 months and the charging base is no longer charging because of a defect on the plug
318,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound and compatibility only downfall battery only last like an hour then need to recharge back again
319,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,This product didn't work as well as said to. They don't charge well. And when they finally do charge they only hold a charge for less then an hour.
320,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them. They fit so nicely. At first I would wonder which one is left and right. Thanks to the little tiny mark L & R on the earbuds for indication. You wouldn't believe how comfortable it felt and easy to fit on. I could have them on the whole day. I have another brand that made my ears hurt and I could not wear them more than an hour. The sound quality is good and big for its size. The battery last longer than described and I like that it has options to use it one at a time or together. The carrying case looks good and it hold the wireless earbuds neatly. The charging is easy. Just plug the cable to the caring case for charging.
321,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return this. Awful.
322,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! Returned 2 other products and this one is the BEST. It holds very well which is sometimes challenging for me and my ears. Sound quality is great/
323,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium True Wireless Earbuds Stereo Dual V4.2...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't what i was looking for. Fit was a little odd for my ears.d
