0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was really happy with this slick looking headphones. They lasted a week only and I just used to talk on the phone in my house: never to go to the gym or run. The control panel started acting weird and all of a sudden it stopped working; it wouldn't stay connected then it wont turn on. I had to spend at least 15 mins every time that i wanted to turn it on and then it only lasted a couple of seconds and it crashed. I guess it goes to stand-by mode by itself, and I say I guess because instruction manual and troubleshooting faq is useless. Company does not have a call canter in the US and you have to dial an international number (dial +86) and when you write them an e-mail they never answer you back. Please do not waste your money in this cool looking headphones that actually dont work."
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received item on October 9th, 2017. At first these were great. Sound was good, battery lasted a good while but went to use them today, November 26th, 2017 and they won't turn on and won't charge. I have maybe used them a dozen times, keep them stored in the storage pouch, have not abused them, and have charged them after use. So I guess I'm stuck w/ a $20+ pair of broken ear buds."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldnt connect to to my Samsung phone or tablet, something $10 cheapies can do. no online support either"
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the earbuds for less than 2 months and today they stopped working. When I originally got them I was very excited and they were great. So great that I ordered a second pair for my son the following day. Now, this morning as I'm working out it just died on me. Not exactly happy. This product says that it is sweat resistant and again up to this point it was working fine. Read the details, look at other options if you want something that's going to last more than 2 months."
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earbuds on the recommendation of my brother. Package was cool, but missing USB charger. No worries as these are everywhere in my house so I used my brothers. Once fully charges I could not (nor could anyone else) pair these to any smart phone/ ipod. All the devices used never picked up the earbuds. Disappointing."
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good. Crackled and terrible connection. If you put your phone in your pocket forget hearing music. Bought another pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones from another company and they work fine.
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were by far the greatest pair of headphones I have ever had. They were extremely light weight, I would forget they were in my ear or around my neck. The sound was truly amazing and when using the mic to talk outside in the wind there was no distortion or wind noise over the mic which is a problem I've had with other hands free devices.

With that said, I have had them for about a week now and have used them mildly. I have had trouble charging them, after having them plugged in over night it appears to be fully charged but after a song or two I get the low battery warning and they shut off. Also the control unit on the head phones themselves has started to gets extremely hot while briefly in use.

Sadly I am going to be returning them, preferably for a new pair but if not a refund. I really hope that it's just my pair that's malfunctioning and not the standard product."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had product for a month, used three or four times, charged the headphones because battery was low and now they won’t turn on. Don’t waste your money on this item."
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t pair.
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars," When the box says ""Lighter weight"" they were not kidding. I originally wondered if anything was even in the box because it was so light. They come with a carrying case that clips using a carabiner. I always like when items come with cases so you can keep all the cords and accessories together. I can clip it on my purse handle and use the headphones any time I go out. The sound quality is really nice. No complaints. And the headphones charge up in less than 2 hours. Comes with 3 sizes of ear buds so you can find the right fit to your ears.

Very satisfied and definitely recommend them to others."
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to get another pair because my son stole mine! These come with several sized fittings so they fit both mine and my son's ears perfectly - which is very hard to find. The rubber looping tucks under the ear fold to keep it secured in place. I was worried about the magnets being too heavy and causing them to fall out but that is not the case. He runs with these in and has zero problems. If you've had any kind of Bluetooth earbuds these are really about the same to pair them to your phone/tablet. There is the volume up and down buttons and the multi function button. You just hold it until the white and orange light alternate, at that time your device is ready to be paired with earbuds. Just make sure your Bluetooth is turned on on your device.

These charge with an included USB and there is a notification on your device that shows you how much battery life is left - a feature I really like. It charges fully fairly quick and the charge lasts for several days of average usage.

The sound is perfect and very clear. Zero static or interference noise. It really blasts loud on max volume and is still quite clear on min volume."
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"it cannot be find on my iPhone 7 Plus, or other devices
(Even after I fully charged it )"
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little skeptical about these at first. I have wireless headphones and decided to give this one a shot. For the price, the sound quality is amazing, I love the carrying case and extra rubber buds. I don't know if I'll need waterproof headphones but I do work up a sweat in the gym. I love the feel of them and how secure they are over your ears. The previous one I have annoys and agitates the inside of my ear after a while like when I'm flying but I love how these wrap around the ears.

I don't regret the purchase and I'm sure you'll be surprised how great these head phones are. Great buy!"
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars," I have owned and tried a bunch of different ones. These are by far my favorite ones and here's why:
-They fit perfectly in and on my ears, comfortably
-They have a beautiful look and finish to them
-The sound quality is amazing for this price point
-They connect very easily to my phone
-Does not take a long time to charge
-Definitely lasts for a long time

I would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs a great, inexpensive pair to work out or just for leisure. They are great!"
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is....WOW!
Best wireless earbuds I've ever owned!
The sound is out of this world!!!🎉
I received the package in the mail in excellent condition, well stored in the case..... I will be purchasing at least 3 more for the family since they can't keep their hands off of mine!
One piece of advice though, do not wear these earbuds on loud volume when you are amoungst other people for example, at work, you will NOT be able to hear them... The noise cancelling technology is incredible!....my husband was literally yelling at me to gain my attention and I didn't hear him, the volume was less than quarter the way up on my phone volume scale. Needless to say you can't go wrong purchasing these but only if you're looking for chrisp, solid treble and bass sounds all at once.!😉
Excellent performance, excellent technology!
One thing I must add however, upon opening my package I noticed the little pouch that the earbuds are housed in the zipper is broken if it wasn't for that I would give the whole overall five stars!
I must add, These blow Beats Earbuds out the water...
hands down!!!"
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this less than one star if I could. Won't pair, and it didn't come with anything to charge it."

Introduction

Ok, so the thing is I love headphones, like, to the point that I buy new headphones just to have new headphones, not necessarily because I need them. You know, some people like purses, others like cats, I love headphones. A few days ago I decided to order three new pairs of headphones, and get a replacement for an old pair that broke. Yes, that's right, I ordered four pairs of headphones. Guess which one I've listened to? That's right, these. Guess which one I'm listening? That's right, these. Guess which ones are sitting in a pile somewhere, that's right, not these. So, without further ado, let me do what I can to paint a word picture that does this beautiful sound machines justice.

Product Description

The headphones are your standard Bluetooth headphones in appearance except they have a remote on their right side. Bluetooth earbuds typically either a) hook on your ear, b) have a necklace that they hook to, or c) have a remote on one side. I have about four of model a), they're great but annoying when I want to listen to one ear only (which is quite often), so I don't tend to use them. I have two pairs of option b), but the battery doesn't last very long so I don't tend to use them. I believe I have about three of model c), and they are typically my preferred method. The remote is nice because it's easily accessible, the buttons are easy to navigate, and it's great.

These headphones also have a little tab that helps them stay in your ear very well and very comfortably. Seriously, the only reason I took them off recently was the battery died, not because of discomfort. The battery, by the way, lasted my first time for about 4-5 hours, but I do not think that was a full charge.

The magnetic part is cool and all, quite strong actually, but not extremely useful. It does help when you're putting the headphones away as they tangle much much less than normal headphones, but why would you put these headphones away? They sound so great I'd prefer to just keep them on.

In terms of audio quality, I literally cannot convince you enough how great they sound. Nearly every set of bluetooth headphones I own have this slight distortion sound to them. They either sound like someone blew out the speakers ever so slightly before sending them to me, or that the speakers need to be broken before they sound great. The thing is, the sound never goes away. My (previous) favorite pair even had that sound, but they had great sound on top of that so I did not notice much of a difference. Guess what are the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I've owned that don't have that annoying background noise (that possible only I can hear)? That's right, these ones.

On top of not sounding slightly distorted, these sound about as good as my all time favorite pair (Sony Extra Bass earbuds), except those were wired, designed by a sound company, and had the worlds best grips. These headphones compete with my audiophile headphones while being Bluetooth and having crappy grips. Yea, the grips are nothing great. They're not bad, but I've definitely had better. Most people won't care though to be honest, or even notice a difference by the way.

Again, I highly recommend these headphones. Honestly, these are truly wonderful headphones and I am absolutely glad I bought them. They are basically the headphones I have been wishing I had since I lost my old Sony headphones (Rest in Peace where you are!) and are officially my new favorite headphones.

Conclusion:

The best pair of headphones I currently own. Highly comfortable, great sound, awesome headphones."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are the best I've ever used, and that includes the iPhone earbuds that come with all Apple products. The sound is great! They stay in my ears during long, sweaty runs, and they're easy to adjust volume and turn on/off. It does take quite a long time pressing the on/off button for them to actually turn on/off so you have to keep them in your ears and wait for the buds to tell you they're connected or disconnected but it's not bothersome.

I don't really need the extra little piece of silicone that keeps them in your ear, but that's probably useful for some people. I've used these for about 2-3 months almost daily at the gym while working out, running, walking, etc as well as outside on walks. They do a great job of staying in the ear and delivering great sound.

I haven't used them for phone calls so I can't speak on that part but as a bluetooth sound delivery system, they're perfect. They even come delivered with charge so you can use them right out of the box! I use them about 30-60 minutes per day and get about a week or two out of every full charge. That works very well for me. Great product!"
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars, love these headphones they are really comfortable and versitile great to be used anywhere any time connects to bluetooth.
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these magnetic headphones! They have many accessories and fittings to find just the right fit for comfort! They come with a compact durable carrying case as well! The sound quality is amazing! Great bass and the highs mids and lows are all on point! They are light weight and extremely comfortable! I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a clear crisp and concert like headphone experience with the convenience of sweat resistance!
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are excellent. Easy to work, holds a charge for a long time and comfortable. Great value!"
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price, great sound-"
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound breaks up and if you turn your head or move wrong it cuts out. Sometimes the sound is solid and great but most times it's bad. I can't seem to pair it with more than once device at a time. If it's paired with my laptop I can't pair it with anything else. even if I'm nowhere near the laptop. Not happy. I would return if I knew where the box was. The ear buds themselves are good. Shape and feel, but that alone can't make these worth the buy. I normally switch to my old pair with a cord for reliability."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a lot of base, but for $25 dollars you can't expect much more."
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,after a few days only right ear worked.
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound could be better but for the price these works great.
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Got em quick in less then 24 hours annnd they totally work better then I expected totally worth it
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think you’ll ever spend $13 and be happier.
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These last ONLY 5 1/2 hours! I am not impressed
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product at a good price!
Lord bless!"
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good earphones, comes with a little case to hold the extra ear buds"
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that these headphones are magnetic if I can just say that first - so cool! I've had another pair of magnetic headphones in the past but they had trouble sticking together, but that is not the case with these.

The cord that connects the two earbuds is long enough so you don't feel like one wrong neck move will make the earbuds come out, but also its spaced far apart enough that you don't feel like you may accidentally rip them out of your ear while jogging. I like to use these around the house while chatting with friends and cleaning or cooking, as well as for runs. These are great earbuds and also have great and clear sound! :)"
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones to use during field work and for general excercising. First thing I should say is that I was immediately impressed by the quality of the earphones. From the presentation, to the included case, everything seems to give the impression that these are high end esrphones. For the price, they are definitely a great buy they did not have any problems staying in my ear, and I found the magnetic feature very useful. Connecting to my phone was a breeze, and the battery seems to last a very long time - they even came with a charge out of the box. All in all, I am happy with my purchase, and would not hesitate to buy again."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome

8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"received it 10 days ago. waited for couple days before I post my review.
I searched a lot of bluetooth earbuds, and then purchased this due to the high star rating and reasonable price.
it is impressive
easy pairing, loud and clear sound, good base!
The battery life is soooo long!
I am not a heavy user, just 2 hours per day during I work out in gym. It has been 10 days after the 1st time charged, but the baterry level is still high."
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using these headphones at the gym and love them! They fit snuggly in my ear without causing any discomfort, but dont budge which is the biggest issue i have had in the past. They are lightweight and sound awesome for the price point. Setup wad suoer easy and I was also impressed that they came with a cute carrying case that keeps them protected. Definitrly recommend these!"
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can now experience the joy that are wireless ear buds! I can't wait to use them when I'm at work so I'm not stuck to my computer. My office will now be accessible to me from all corners while still being able to listen to my music. I tried them out as soon as I got them and boy, was I ecstatic. Easy set up, GREAT sound, and the fact that I can go anywhere with them in is just... Joyous!"
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Its says that any phone can connect this?i guess not.its not working with my samsung j5 prime.it cant recognize it.
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars, Great earbuds. Came with smaller sized buds which is perfect for my smaller ears. I love that they're magnetic so I never have to worry about them getting caught on anything in my purse. They also came with a case and charger
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good quality. I like the different size ear tip. I choose the smallest and it is very comfortable. Another thing I like is the container. I don't worry the cable will be tangled and mess with makeups, keys in my purse anymore."
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not enuff stars to rate these. The sounds whoaaaaaa superb,build gr8 quality,fit perfect neva fell out my ears, setup was super easy,packaging super delivery in 2 days fastttttt. I'm buying again. 10 star product n seller"
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds were heavy, but the grip were surprisingly comfortable and I can go through my days without a problem. Battery life lasts me for a good 4-5 hours no problem. For its cost, a great product!"
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good product for the price nothing to be unhappy about. They work and work good in the gym, the magnets are too big for a motorcycle helmet."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,It looks expensive and works well. I have worn this pair for two hours straight and they don’t hurt my ears. Highly recommend.

9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality they fit perfectly in the ear and don't fall out very easy to use and easy to read instructions. Has a very long reach too
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Work perfect and sound good. Can't beat for yhe price.
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived as promised, in perfect condition, with clear directions for use. Really like the Latin name: otium = leisure."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, easy to pair, easy to control"
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are by far the best Bluetooth earphones i’ve Ever had. If you want wireless earphones that sound great these are a Must buy
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging is very nice and professional. The earphones come with a black case to store them in along with different sets of ear plugs to suit your needs.
The head phones are feel comfy and are easy to connect to Bluetooth.
Great for its price!"
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,They have good sound quality. Battery lasts a good amount of time. Good sound cancelling quality. My struggle with these is even using the smallest covers they are a bit big for my ears. I can still use them just not for long periods of time. Would make great workout headphones. They stay in place very well. Edited to add: the sound quality is terrible for phones calls. It sounds like the person is a mile away from you. Even with volume on max it’s hard to hear. So soft sounding.
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love these headphones. They sound good and for me the charge on the headphones lasts 8 to 10 hours. I usually have them in at work. But I would buy these again.
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"If sound and comfort is your preference then this is a definite must buy, noise cancellation and comfortable fit with great bass"
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned many pair of bluetooth headsets and these are by far the best dollar for dollar and they are relatively cheap.
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphones are amazing, i use them for the gym, noise cancellation is perfect, overall well design. Do recommend them."
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,They are very clear however they don't hang on the neck properly. Still overall nice sound quality
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not connecting to my iPhone 6 at all.

Update: Didn't connect to my boyfriend's iPhone 5 either. They did connect to my dad's Galaxy. I'm guessing these are just for Android devices. Sucks for me, but at least dad likes them..."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is not bad on these and the connection seems to extend pretty good before it drops. But these lasted 2 weeksish and now are totally dead. They won't charge, the won't connect, I tried multiple cords nothing works. I was listening to music at work, went on lunch and plugged them in to charge so when I came back, they would be good to go and totally dead. The charge is only good for about 4-5 hrs which is why I charge them on my break. I did it the same way everyday and today dead. Sucks cause I like to listen to music while I work. Nothing crazy happened while at lunch, no storms, power flicker nothing. I am giving two stars because the functionality was not bad when they worked. Glad it happened while I could still return them. Buy at your own risk."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,I am really pleased with the excellent packaging of the product and really love the quality of sounds that it gives off. Don't exactly know if they are 100% sound canceling headphones but they do seem to blur out outside sound giving you everything you need to enjoy your entertainment. But I would say that there should be a clip on how to adjust the fitting. For example when the headphones are being used they kind are spread out and it just looks a bit awkward when the wire is so spread out. Just wished there was a adjustable clip because that would really give this product that finishing touch. Overall this product is very satisfying!
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,If you want a clean overall sound it's definitely great for the price. Highs and mids come of well. Bass is ok as long as you're not such a bass junkie. I mostly only use earbuds when I am working out. During my workouts I want bass heavy DnB and Hip Hop. It only does an adequate job for this type of music.
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't even work
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst Bluetooth ever, I cannot put my phone in my pants pocket without it cutting out. Your phone needs to be so close. Useless if you want to put your phone in your pocket well working out. Terrible product"
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these earphones except for the fact that they fit uncomfortable in my ears. I used the smallest attachment but they still fit big and bulky in my ears. Sound is great and easily connects to my device. The magnetic earbuds are also great. My only complaint is the fit. 😕
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Kinda sucks had it for not even 2 weeks before it broke and since i didnt pay the warranty im out of luck great otherwise and good noise canceling
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall okay headphones. They work well for the price and have a relatively long battery life. However, the charger cord that they came with doesn't actually fit and won't charge them. I had another one from a different device that I tried and it happened to work, but otherwise I would be unable to use them. Also, they cut out sometimes for seemingly no reason. The headphones themselves are fine, but the charging cord issue is ridiculous."
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality and battery life on these earbuds are surprisingly good! Overall I’m very pleased with them for the price. I mainly use them at the gym or listening to music/podcasts while doing chores at home. I can usually go a room or two away from my phone without noticable static, which is great.

The only reason I give 4 stars is that none of the loops that came with them were a good fit for my ears - they all seemed too big and just didn’t fit properly. All of them make my ears sore after about 20-30 minutes, so I don’t use them. They stay in place pretty well without the loops, so this isn’t a deal breaker. Just a heads up for those with smaller ears!"
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is really good - but the build feels overly cheap even at this price point. Feels like it would break after a few weeks of use. Ended up returning and picking up one of the competitors for a few more bucks but feels far more durable.
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're good, but they have an odd effect on the bluetooth capacity of the iPhone7. The phone could not detect the earbuds until I reset them AND forgot the other bluetooth devices that had been paired with my phone. Then, my phone couldn't detect my bluetooth headphones until I made it forget the earbuds. Basically, the phone can never have both in memory and whenever I want to switch back to the earbuds I ALSO have to reset them, which is annoying. It's 2018 people. This should be easy.
Another stupid thing is that the instructions for the reset are useless. I had to contact customer service and the instructions he gave me were not the ones given in the manual but they worked. Update the manual so that customers don't have to go out of their way to extract information from the company."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, not great. The chord behind the neck catches on my shirt and when I turn my head, they will yank in my ear so that's uncomfortable, I'm not sure if this is an issue with just these or any other similar style, I have not tried any others.

Pairing can be a bit of a pain. I was unable to reliably use them with my windows 8 laptop. And if you're thinking about pairing with laptop and phone and being able to switch between the two, forget about it."
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first pair or wireless and they are great. I use solely for the gym and keep around the back of my neck. Completely out of the way and stay in ears. Only thing is it messes up calls - sometimes they go onto speaker but not into earphones. Only sometimes so I can’t figure out why. But great earphone
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and reasonable sound quality. My main gripe is the terrible short battery life. My bad, but when running a half marathon they (being fully charged when I started) gave up after 90 minutes with ""low battery"". Would trade a litle more size for a bit more reasonable battery life."
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. Easy to set up. Nice and light, sounds pretty good for such a low price. I like the shape of the ear pieces, they stay in my ear great. I love the case that comes with it."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised by how well these work. They are fine for audio or for voice calls, and the battery lasts several hours of use on a charge.

Note: the headphones cannot be used while charging.

The cable could be thicker - just for durability - but I'm fairly satisfied already."
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good for phone calls and music, and the charge lasts forever. It also recharges quickly. For the price it exceeds expectations."
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are alright. They keep falling out of my ears and cant seem to get them to stay put
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",2.0 out of 5 stars,The audio quality for running is good. I charge it every 2 runs. For me the audio control button pulls to the right side when the cord is resting on my neck. It's a little off balanced because there's more weight on the right side of the control than the left. I feel like the cable ends up unevenly placed on my neck.

2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Messed up my first review so lets try again.

6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Most satisfied I have ever been with a product ever!These are just amazing headphones for under $30. I can run with them and the sound quality is quite good. Certainly worth the money!

0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great. It is nice that they are magnetic which makes them hard to lose.

3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good!"
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to bluetooth headphones, these work well. Some parts of the function I don't understand. The back of the earbuds are magnetic. I would love for someone to let me know what the situation calls that would need for the earbuds to be connected together(as in the photo I posted). The control box has buttons for volume control, power button, and the usb charger. There is also a small hook that, for some unknown reason, hooks together the two sides of the wires. They do work really well. Sound quality is pretty good. They are easy to pair the bluetooth with your device. It also comes with a cute carrying case that can keep them safe while in bag and on the go. They are nice, I just personally feel that some of the features were not necessary."
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars," This is what I use whenever I go to the gym. It connects to my phone right away after I turned on the Bluetooth which is a plus because my previous headphones take a while to connect. It took me an hour and a half to charge it for the first time which is okay. The sound is crisp and clear whether I use it for music or talking to someone over the phone. I haven't done any extreme running in the treadmill so I can't say if it sticks to your ears that much but overall in my experience it doesn't fall.

One thing I like about it is that it has a nice and sleek design casing. It also has some extra ear plugs if that's what you call.

I'll continue to use this headphone as it is."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound: 8/10
durabiliry: 9/10
convenience: 6/10

good sound compared to higher end products, with the right mixture of trebble and bass they arent too ""tinny"" and are pretty comfortable to listen to especially if you use them with an equilizer app. The magnetic backs on the sizable drivers are convnvenient, but the one problem I have wih this product is that one earbud in and one earbud out just doesnt work. if you put the cord behind your neck, and let one earbud dangle on your chest, it slowly droops until it takes all of the cord and it limits your maneuverability until you pull the earbud highet up closer to your neck. if you try to put the earbud on top of your ear, the earbud again drops too far and you end up looking like a dingus. A simple fix for this is to include a small clip in the middle of the earbuds so you can clip then to your collar and they will not fall too far."
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fabulous set of earbuds. They did not come charged, but they were quick to charge, and then they connected to my android super easy. They came with such a cute carrying case too, which was an extra bonus. They sound wonderful, and they block out most of the outside noise, which is also great. I turned it up pretty loud, and I didn’t hear any distortion. Overall, this is a great set of headphones!"
4,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned multiple types of wireless Bluetooth headsets from multiple manufacturers and to be honest I have hated most of them. These Otium Bluetooth Wireless Headphones are a different story. I really like these headphones and have been using them everyday since I received them, and here is why:
-- They fit very well on my ears without falling off, and fit will within my ears as well.
-- The sound quality is much better than I expected. Lows are low and Highs are high.
-- They have a very professional appearance and look like a higher end product, compared to the price that I paid.
-- These headphones connect quickly and automatically to my device. With some of my other headphones it can be a battle.
-- Charges quickly (fully charged in less than 2 hours)
-- Once fully charges these headphones last for hours.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone who needs a great, high quality pair of Wireless Bluetooth Headphones that won't fall off of your ears while working out or while relaxing. I wear these headphones to listen to Binaural Sleep Meditation Music at night and they work great!"
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these worth my Android.

Have had wireless headphones before, and the other headphones had a loud beeping noise Everytime you pressed a button and I was super happy these didn't have that 'feature' however after using them a while I realized having that feature was helfpul as there is sometimes a delay between pressing play and the app actually playing. Without the beep sometimes I wasn't sure if I pressed the button or not. This was annoying but not a deal breaker.

Weird thing, these headphones would work to advance or rewind my audio books (it was reversed, you pressed volume up to rewind and volume down to advance) but it would not advance songs in Pandora or Spotify. Again annoying but not a deal breaker.

Battery life is great! Never had it die one during the day. I don't typically used them continuous but I use them for my hour to hour and a half commute each way and sporadically during my 8 hour work day.

The distance I could walk from my phone was much greater than my old headphones which was great. Noise isolation was also better than my old headphones.

Fit was also good. I recently lost these headphones though and given the relatively minor issues I listed above I will be looking for a different pair. However if I hadn't lost them, I probably would not have bothered to replace them."
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my goodness, shame on me for waiting to buy blue-tooth buds , I'm serious, since being a 3-4 time a week gym rat since 2011 and dealing with tangled cords or pulling cords out of your ears on a smith machine or pull-up, these buds are EXCELLENCE .

And I use them for over 90 minutes -2 x's a week and charge them to play it safe, but they have yet to run out on me.
Plus they sync in 2-3 seconds via your blue tooth phone
Once you click on they audibly notify you ( headset on ) and the same when you power off.
Also has a simple + - volume control near your right side.
Nice addition is the round zippered case and that the buds are magnetized back to back creating less tangles.

As soon as customer service tells me how to sync with my TV sound-bar via blue tooth I'll be ecstatic !"
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most comfortable in-ear/wireless earbuds I've tried so far. The rounded loop seems to go ""in"" my ear with the least effort and I really like the magnetic clasp feature for when they're not in use. My only major complaint is power management. They don't seem to turn off automatically the way others I've owned do. One time I forgot I left them on while removing them to talk to a store clerk. An hour later when I got home and thought to check, sure enough, they were still on! For something so advanced, it seems pretty old-school to have to actively manage on/off power states..."
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this because I do running after work and I need a pair of headphones to listening to music. Running with these headphones are really amazing, they will not fall out from your ears. Putting them in your ears doesn't get pain like the others that I've had. It's the best wireless headphones I've ever used! Nice looking! These are really comfortable even if I have it on for a long time, my ears do not have any irritation. Highly recommend!"
9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless buds are pretty amazing. The feel of the materials are definitely a quality found in higher end products. They stayed in my ears and didn't hurt me. Sound quality is excellent for the price. No issues with reception from or to the phone. I do wish they came with and clip so the wire wouldn't bounce on my neck when running.

Comes with and small, round zipper pouch, along with different size speaker covers with little extenders to help the buds stay in place. I usually have issues with the comfort of the extenders, but these are seemingly designed for me, the extenders are very flexible and soft but strong enough to stay put."
0,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, best Bluetooth earbuds for the price, battery life lasts the entire day with mild usage, with continuous , say like at the gym, it lasts about 4-6 hrs. Volume gets pretty loud, I usually keep the volume around 50-70% and the audio can still be heard by someone next to me. Build quality is good and it fits snugly in my ears. The compact carrying case is great too. Only thing I didn't like is that the small black plastic piece that used to tie the wire together/ adjust the wires, comes off too easily. In fact, after the first week I already lost the plastic piece. Luckily it doesn't matter too much and I get by just fine without it, but it does suck that it came off so easily. I'll probably just end up making it or just 3D printing one myself when I get the chance. Overall this is a great product, obviously can't be compared to something like the jaybirds, but these are still great Bluetooth earbuds for the price. Hope this helps."
1,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two pairs of Phaiser Bluetooth buds and so far, both have broken on me- eventually a wire breaks and one ear goes out, and there's no fixing that. These sound just as good as the more expensive pair of phaisers for half the price. I'm not an audiophile so, while these surely aren't the best sound quality available, they're great for the price. I only use them to listen to podcasts and tunes at work where I'm surrounded by loud machinery, so that would all be wasted on me anyway."
2,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,These Earbuds are very unique! The design is different and also the way it fits into your ear. They sound crisp and get really loud. They fit inside instead of the traditional outside of the ear. If you can get used to the feel then you will like them. The way they are magnetized when hangin from your neck is great so that they don't go swinging everywhere. Nice buy
3,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I love the magnet that keeps the buds together around my neck while I am not using them!! Easy to sync to my iphone and great sound quality. Nice price too. you can move away from your phone quite a bit before it starts breaking up. I go 2 rooms away with no issues! Then are very comfortable and don't pull in my ears. The charger looks durable. Nice product!"

Great fit and they do not pop out of your ears...no matter how sweaty you get! I love the sound.

I love these wireless bluetooth earbuds, and they seem to do what's advertised. Good product!!"
5,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,The earbuds are awesome. They look and sound good. Metal construction and light weight. I've bought many bluetooth earbuds but these really stand out. I listen to them at work. I work in a warehouse and i can get through the whole shift with one charge at 75% volume. I would definately recommend these earbuds. These earbuds are worth four times their price. You won't be dissatisfied.
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several pairs of earbuds, each for different things. buy this one for my wife workouts. I bought this pair because of the over the ear design, hoping they would stay in better ,i feel The sound quality is good, the price was right, Pairing was simple and the controls are easy to navigate. Very happy with my purchase."
7,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have been my favorite ear buds so far. They are extremely comfortable and the sound is excellent. The charge actually lasts for a good amount of hours, I don't know maybe four hours of straight listening?....maybe more. They definitely stay in without budging during during sweaty runs, and that was my most important need, besides the sound of course. If these ever give out I will definitely be ordering them again."
8,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, the sound quality is good, and I love that they have magnets on them so if I need to take them out for a few minutes I won't accidentally lose them.

9,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually have very little faith in Bluetooth headphones and am pretty much an AUX cord loyalist. These headphones showed me that a quality pair of BT earbuds can be made for under $50. Now, don't get me wrong, these don't hold a candle to more expensive wired sets, but these are pretty amazing for the price. And they don't look, feel or operate like they're cheap! Will be back for another pair when I (inevitably) lose them."

I am a chef and I wear one earpiece at a time. 3 months after I received them the left ear clip completely broke off. Powerbeats 3 have a 12 hour battery life which got me through so many rough times. I ordered these because I didn't want to pay 120 to replace my beats and they say the battery life lasts 8 hours listening/calling. I call bs. I fully charged these and they lasted 2 hours at most. I wouldn't order this product for the battery life and I'm sending them back for false advertising. Sound is not bad, but j can't charge my earbuds every 2 hours"
6,"Bluetooth Headphones, Otium Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7...",3.0 out of 5 stars,These work well on devices that are compatible....they are comfortable and seem to hold a charge for a good amount of time. I am giving them 3 stars because I purchased them to use with my FireTV and FireStick and they are not recognized by either.
