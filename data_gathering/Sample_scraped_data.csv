,Edifier H650 Hi-Fi On-Ear Headphones - Noise-isolating Foldable and Lightweight Headphone - Fit Adults and Kids - Blue
0,"I'm one of those people that goes for ""cheapy"" headphones and eventually they don't work well. These are priced low but I love the sound. I find them comfortable and the packaging was great. No wrestling with those awful plastic packaging. I also love the comfort. I go for comfort and these fit the bill. For some reason ear buds just don't work for me. Either it's from the sweating or I have Dumbo ears. This is my fourth pair of headphones and these by far are the best!"
1,"My background:
-had a pair of sennheisser hd 280's.
-have tried other cheap headphones in this price range.
-love classical music and listen to some new retro wave

Feel and Look
After using them for an hour my ears feel a little sore. But, i do have a big head so keep that in mind. The headphone pads are pretty soft.
Sound Quality:
These headphones have a pretty accurate sound and do a good job in the mids and highs. The bass lacks depth and warmth. I did notice that when i pushed the headphones closer to my head the bass came in much clearer. Most headphones in this price range that have large drivers (like these do) sound really bad and have horrible overbearing bass. Even the koss porta pros have this problem. (https://www.amazon.com/Koss-Porta-Pro-Headphones-Silver/dp/B00001P4ZH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1506812526&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=koss+portapro&psc=1)

Keep in mind that these headphones are still pretty crappy. They are 20 dollars. If you want good headphones you'll have to spend a little more than 20 dollars.

Update: They broke in less than 2 weeks. Not sure what happened. damn these are fragile"
2,Purchased 2 pairs for my kids for Christmas. It is January 22 and both pairs have already stopped working. Too bad because we really liked these headphones when they did work
3,"***New Update 10/16/2016***
After posting my first review, I was contacted by the seller and was informed that they offer a 1 year warranty which includes a free repair or replacement of my headphones. I opted for the free replacement and it was shipped and delivered promptly.

These headphones are lightweight, easily portable, fold up, and come in a variety of different colors. They are not bulky like many headphones out there and are pleasantly appealing to the eyes. These headphones have only one wire which makes being tangle free easier.

I am not an audiophile so I can't talk about ""bass"" or ""tremble"" like some music experts can. But they sound great to me and come at a very reasonable price. They are comfortable and are best suited for people with more petite sized heads and children.

I have changed my initial rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because of the seller's wonderful customer service and following through with their word. 5 stars was not given because 1 star was deducted for being defective the first time.

***First Review 10/6/2016***
I got these headphones during the latter part of last year. I loved that they were lightweight, had good noise isolation, and were pink (my favorite color). I also liked that they were easily portable and could fold up. They were pretty comfortable too. I would use them primarily for the gym and personal use. Recently, the audio has been coming out of one ear though and I have been struggling with the one wire to get the sound to come out of both. They were good while they lasted but it's time to move onto the next headphones. The quality is definitely lacking here because it hasn't even been a year and it is already having issues. These headphones are best suited for people with more petite sized heads and children. It's better to get something else though which is better quality."
4,"It took forever to find headphones that were small lightweight on-ear types, I chose these for that alone.

Pros:
1. The sound is decent. Not the best I've ever heard, but decent.
2. The color is definitely orange like a pumpkin. The padding is a light gray, almost white. Kind of a ""meh"" color combo, but I like orange. You can easily see them on a desk in a dark room lit only by a monitor.

Cons:
1. The cord. However I didn't know it would come with a short flimsy cord, as thin as a toothpick and unable to hook into an extension cable without causing static. Luckily my sound system's right speaker has a plug-in for headphones, but these Edifier headphones are wired by the left ear, which means it must cross over my keyboard and workspace to be used. I tried running it under my keyboard, im afraid to damage the wire. They really need an extender to work, a really lightweight one.

2. One thing that you don't often think about when buying headphones. Are they noisy while wearing them? These are noisy to the point of distraction from what you are listening to. The pivoting parts creak like a house settling, long after putting them on. Any emotion that causes your ears to move such as laughter or sadness will make them creak as well. I've never had this problem before with other headphones. I'm thinking of trying WD40 on it to see if it changes anything."
5,"Very comfortable, I love them! I need comfortable headphones because I had brain surgery for my epilepsy and these headphones are great. They are light, and do not give me a headache! They keep the background noise out, and the music in! The price is great. They are wonderful!"
6,"I'm wearing these right now! They have very good hi-fi sound, are not on the treble side, or seem to lack bass. I'd say the only thing I miss is that they aren't stereo, and I miss that. But for what they are, they are very good! Noise cancelling? Almost too much! When I have them on and someone asks me something, or talks to me, I have to lift off one side and free that ear so I can hear! They are more noise cancelling than my $50+ Sennheiser that stopped working suddenly.

If you have a large head and wear glasses, these might be too small. I have a smallish head, so they are not a problem. The colors are fun, so pick the color that expresses your personality or matches your device.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are for smaller heads. If you have a large head, they will feel tight. If that doesn't bother you, go for these!"
7,These headphones say for adults and kids. They lied about the adult part unless you have an irregularly small head. These headphones are made for toddlers and very small kids. These headphones are a waste of money and time!! DO NOT BUY!!
8,"I am stunned by the sound quality of these earphones. The bass is ripping, the highs are clear and piercing but not tinny. I listen mostly to rock music though am a big fan of acoustic flamenco. I've used phones that are five times as expensive as the Edifer H650 and the Edifiers blow them away. I may buy a couple more of them just to have backups in case sometime steals my pair."
9,"I'm very happy that you contacted me, because I do have a question. This is the first time in my life that I have ever used headphones. I'm 71 years old. I live in a Rehab place and share a room, thus the need for headphones. I was given a pair of headphones when I got here, but they recently went bad. In my attempt to buy new ones, I failed to remember the most important features that I needed. One main feature I needed was that I could control the volume in the cord, not the TV. But I started using your headphones at night to listen to my Playlists, using my Kindle. The experience was, for me, fabulous. The sound amazing!!! I listened to many songs that I've been listening to since the 60's, 70's, 80's, etc. and have never known what they could have sounded like. I will keep yours, even though they don't meet all my requirements, because I literally had an out-of-body experience. The one question I had is that the size of the earmuffs seem small. The description of your product did say they are for men and women. Do you have a larger size?"
10,"These work very well for the purpose I needed them for. I don't need to wear them for long periods of time, which is good since the ear piece is too small. They sit on the edges of the ear rather than fitting around the ear so if I do wear them for long periods my ears start to get annoyed. But they aren't tight and so they don't press on the ears/head which is good. And there seems to be plenty of adjust-ability to them. My daughter borrowed them and adjusted them as small as they would go and they fit her tiny head just fine. My head is a bit bigger than average and they fit me just fine. So other than wishing the ear piece was a bit larger they are a great set of headphones."
11,"I wanted cheap over-hear headphones for the subway. I'm a woman with a small head, and these are comfortable on me. These sound great for the price, with no noise leakage that I can detect. They were also able to block out a mariachi band on the subway.

I've paired them with the Nexum AQUA Portable Battery-Free, In-Line Headphone DAC and Amplifier - Android MicroUSB, Space Grey. I store them in the Samaz Pen Bag Pencil Case Large Capacity Canvas Pencil Bag Pouch Stationary Case Makeup Cosmetic Bag (Light Blue) in my purse."
12,Earbuds make my ears itch so I wanted something comfortable with a low profile (so they wouldn't be knocking into things if I was wearing them lying down). The sound seems to be very good...though I haven't used them much for music yet...mostly doing work on my laptop and watching things on Netflix or Hulu. I looked at a lot of headphones before ordering these and am satisfied with my choice.
13,"My granddaughter needed headphones to take to school and these were absolutely perfect. They fit her great, appear pretty sturdy and have withstood transporting back and forth from home to school in her backpack since the beginning of the school year. The sound quality appears good and have been worth the price. I would definitely recommend these for children.

These were delivered when expected and in perfect condition."
14,"These are great headphones, especially for the price. They're comfortable, block a lot of external noise, and the sound is great. I bought them for my 90-year-old dad so he can listen to his Natl Geographic shows on his I-Pad without my mother having to hear the sounds of animals attacking animals. I know it's part of nature, but not especially entertaining for most of us. And I bought the bright orange so the old fart won't lose them. Now everyone is happy!"
15,"I needed a new pair of headphones after my Bose headphones decided to die after owning them for 5 years. I use headphones when I workout at the gym, jog, & run. I found for the price, this was an excellent pair. The sound quality is good (though not comparable to $100+ through Bose) & they are comfortable. They don't fall off when I run (I tested it several times: trail runs & treadmill). I own a 10 year old ipod & need something with a wire jack & this product worked perfectly. Also, I used it traveling on a plane & train & though it didn't drown out all the noise, I could hear my music enough to enjoy. I only gave it 4 out of 5 because I was hoping the cushion around the headphones would fit entirely over my ears, but I want to give 5-stars to Edifier's customer service. They really reach out to the consumer about their product. Definitely give it a try! Plus I love the pink color! :)"
16,"I purchased these to replace an old pair that I use with my laptop and netbook PC's. I love the vibrant color, easy fit on my big head, comfortable ear pads, and great sound. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a easy to fold, portable set of headphones that will not bankrupt your pocketbook!"
17,"Although I encountered some quality loss during the first months of use ( sound problems and interference), they reward me with a new pair considering the warranty. I really don't complain on these. They are very high quality sound for a great price. This new pair looks even sturdier (maybe they redesigned them). I like companies that doesn't hesitate with clients' warranty, I love costumer oriented companies!, they are FTW!!"
18,"I bought these over two years ago, and I still love them. I wear eyeglasses, and these headphones don't squeeze the temple tips of the frames into my head, so I can wear these headphones comfortably for extended periods of listening. They are also easy to adjust, and hold adjustments well.
These are primarily used for audiobook listening and they have been excellent. I'm no audio connoisseur, so I can't give a detailed assessment about the sound quality for listening to music. All I can tell you is that what I hear sounds great.
My only grievance is how twisted the cord can get and how often I have to untwist it (once a week). Since the cord twisting is such a minor thing I wasn't going to knock off a star for it."
19,"My rating is relative to the price paid. I have a set of Bose noise cancelling phones that are superb but too big to travel with sometimes. I saw these and thought it was worth a try as a spare inexpensive travel set for when I am tight on space. Good sound quality with a reasonable quality of build. The fit could be a bit tight for those with larger heads but for me as a woman, it was fine. I like the flexibility of the item as well. Feels durable. I wish it had a clip on the cable to attach to my clothing when running though!"
20,"Got here , shipping box was completely fine and not so much as a scratch was on the box , but unfortunately the headphones were broken . A wire was sticking out and one of the little end peiced connecting the headphone its self was broken off making it unusable. Also note that its very very small. The padding wont cover your whole ear and doesnt have very good sound quality (probably because it was broken in the first place )
Wouldnt recomend, go to walmart and but some"
21,Very very good headphones ! For the price the quality is amazing. They can be folded up so they are very travel-friendly! There is no mic nor control for the headphones so they are really meant for listening to music or for entertainment purposes. They are truly noise canceling which is great to block out noise! I would hands down recommend this product and would buy again!!
22,"Update: I was contacted by the seller promptly after emailing them.. Their response was quick and a new pair of headphones was delivered within 2 days. Changed to 4 stars to reflect excellent customer service.. Hopefully the new pair holds up better.

I used these headphones on a daily basis for about a month and a half. I don't listen to anything ridiculously loud, and they stay at my desk when not in use. Overall the earphones aren't uncomfortable unless you wear them for a long period of time. They do slip around a bit, so don't try to use them when you are moving around. I was initially happy with this purchase. For the price they are a little better than what I expected. Unfortunately, it only took a month and a half for the left speaker to die completely. I checked all the solder joints and the magnet are still in good shape. It just completely stopped working. If you can find a pair that works, great."
23,"I bought these after the price went down by a few dollars and after my Amazon basics headphones broke of continuous use of 1.5 years. They are small around the ears, no matter what ear lobe size you have!
The sound to me is almost as the Amazon basics going for $12, but the Amazon ones beat this one just by the boom of the sound. These ones sound a bit on the distant side, and only that.
What I like about the Edifier ones is that the ear muffs are soft leather as opposed to the faux (plastic) leather Amazon basic has. Do get them for the 19 dollar price, and not a penny more. You should in my honest opinion buy the one cord Amazon basics and this one, and you will render the vote to Amazon for sound. Also, the cable on this one is very thin and WILL snap if you accidentally sit on it and move it around without looking. The Amazon one is slightly thicker. Good luck!"
24,Really clear sound at all volume levels. Great headphones! The only slightly negative is that the ear cushions seem a little small for me but they are still very comfortable to wear.
25,"For the price they are exceptional ear phones , The sound quality is good and the noise blockage is fine . Wore them at the airport and were much better the the olderplastic pair I had they broke ,, ,these have a steel piece set in the head band . Don't expect these to be as good as a large pair that completely cover your ears but for a small pair at this price there fine .."
26,"Great little headphones. They are on-ear headphones, so they seem small at first, but they do a great job at delivering sound. They're small and compact, great for tucking in my book bag at the end of the day. So far they've been a great pair of earphones. I'm happy with my purchase."
27,"For those who were looking for headphones like these because of the portability of such foldable on-ear headphones, I was on the same boat and am happy with these. I am not an audiophile, but they sound well enough for me. Definitely not the best in terms of materials, but it's not what I was looking for and the plastic is nonetheless smooth and comfortable. Headband has nothing of note, and the earcups face *outwards* when you hang them around the neck. Been using these for a while now with no problems of note. Thank you."
28,"I've been wanting a new pair of on-ear headphones for a while. We had to send my daughter's Beats EP in for repair. I ordered these for her to use while we waited, thinking I'd take them when her Beats get fixed up. She admits these are better than her Beats EP headphones but, ya know, they don't say Beats on the side, so ... Soon, they'll be mine."
29,"Well, they do fold up small and flat. Unfortunately they are uncomfortable and my kids won't wear them, they squeeze my kids head and they hurt. The sound quality is ok. For the price I'm not upset with the purchase, but I can't recommend them."
30,"These headphones are so much better than my earbuds. The sound is amazing. The only problem is that the headphones are a little small. Not uncomfortable but if you have big ears you may want to get headphones that are slightly larger. I do not have large ears and they are perfectly comfortable. Why didnt i buy headphones sooner? My earbuds usually lasted three months before they broke, I hope these earphone last longer. If they do not I certainly will be editing this review. But so far, so great!"
31,"I purchased these headphones for my grandson who wanted a pair just like his grandpop has. Since we couldn't get the exact pair his pop-pop has (because they are a few years old) we search Amazon for something similar. As soon as he tried them he said ""Yep! These are just like pop-pop's!"" Needless to say, he loves the quality of them and says they have great sound as well as cancelling out outside noise. He is happy, therefore I'm happy. Great product."
32,So comfortable and pretty I am very pleased. Fits nice but the ear caps are small which are good and bad. Good for portability and bad for noise cancelation. I love the one sided cord it eliminates the tangling and hassle of the wire. My reason for the 4 stars are based on 2 factors; the ear covers are a bit small and there isn't a case to put them in. I know it stated it did not come with one but would be nice since their main advantage in the description is portability and noise cancelling.
33,One ear stopped working after a month of use. Item is garbage and I rarely write poor reviews but to give out after a month is pretty bad....:(
34,"I loved these headphones. They fit perfectly and had great sound quality.

They lasted for about six months before one the sides stopped operating. They still work, but sound is only produced on one of the on ear headphone sides."
35,"At the time I ordered this I wanted something inexpensive to take on airplanes. And this fit the bill. Cord really seems thin tho, but so far so good. My next set of headphones will be a nice set of noise-cancelling so I don't have to listen to all those in-flight announcements!!"
36,Happy with seller. Product super squeaky at the ear pieces like its caused by plastic pieces/hinge rubbing together when walking. It ruins sound quality.
37,"I bought two pairs of these, one to replace a tattered pair of Sony headphones and the other as a gift to a son who was trying to listen to music through laptop speakers. These are much better than the standard computer speakers and comfortable to wear for several hours. My boy likes that they fold sort of flat for storage.

Right now 'Corcovado' is being played by Ricardo Leao and the fingering on the piano can be clearly heard. Higher notes are more easily heard by these old ears. Not the best pair of headphones on the market but write if you can do better for the price."
38,Nice Looking Headphones but not very good sound.
39,"These are billed as fitting adults and kids, but our teenager said they were tight enough on her to be painful after half an hour. So, back to Amazon they go..."
40,I bought these headphones for my 5th grader. She loves them. They fit comfortably on her head. The sound is very nice and clear. She will use these at school as well as at home. Great bang for your buck!
41,"Bought two pairs for my 9 and 12 year old girls. Both gave me a big thumbs up when they tried them out. I gave them a listen and the sound was very nice and the ear cups were comfortable. Very happy with the purchase.

We've got a big spring break road trip coming up so these will make the trip more comfortable for everyone."
42,"I bought these for school, specifically for my math lab, I needed a pair of noise cancelling headphones while I sit in class and do work. I love these. I gotta say I got the obnoxious orange color because they were 2 dollars cheaper but definitely worth the price. I have also used them for music and the sound is good quality! thanks again amazon and edifier ;)"
43,"After striking out with two other brands, this one fits my bill: light, comfortable, not too large, well constructed, decent sound and reasonably priced. These are not high-end performers, but for my purpose--the gym--they are more than adequate. They are keepers."
44,"I bought these to replace my daughter's volume-limited kiddie headphones. I liked that the other reviews said that they were smaller sized and they would fit her head and ears well. The good news is that they really are kid sized. The bad news is that her old kiddie headphones had more comfortable padding and frankly sounded better. The main problem with these headphones is that they sound tinny.

Now that she was older, I was hoping to upgrade her headphones. Unfortunately, these headphones just don't sounds as good."
45,"These are small and do not cover the entire ear, which means noise around you is easily heard while you watch movies or listen to music. Unless, you crank up the volume and attempt to bust out your ear drums. Good part is, they fold and can be packed easier than the larger ones."
46,"Nice fit, very comfortable to wear, light / not tight. Does not filter much ""outside"" noise, but it's a great headphone for for the price. Beats using earbuds! The colors are super cool - now everyone knows exactly which headphone is theirs!"
47,"Comfortable, look nice, fold up nice and small, great sound quality. The only issue I'm having is for some reason the right audio, and something both sides, cut out depending on how I rotate the plug in my mp3 player. This doesn't happen on my computer, leading me to believe it's the mp3 player, but my ear buds don't do this when plugged into my mp3 player. Maybe some incompatibility in the metal used, or the shape? Overall great product!"
48,"These headphones are great! I'm no audiophile and I usually don't care much about brand when I purchase headphones, but as soon as I put these on, I immediately knew that these were serious quality. I can't even go back to my old earbuds after having these on! I originally purchased these as a gift, but the would be recipient ended up getting headphones from someone else, so I just purchased a different gift. I was close to returning these, but they were so good, I ended up keeping them for myself.

I purchased the white headphones, and though I'm usually wary of white because it attracts dirt so easily, I really love the way they look. Very stylish, without being over-the-top. I don't like very bulky headphones that feel heavy on my head, so these are great! Very comfortable ear-pads as well. I have double lobe piercings and a cartilage piercing and I've never felt too uncomfortable wearing the headphones over the earrings. I also like the one side only cord as they keep the headphones from tangling too much. The sound is great to me, although I'm really only used to Apple headphones and the JVC gummy headphones. All my music sounds great on it, from classical to pop, or even hip-hop. I'm very impressed.

I'd definitely buy these headphones again in the future, and for $30, I could definitely experiment with the other colors they have too! On-Ear headphones just may be the way to go from now on!"
49,"I have ordered the white pair and have been using it for 6 months without any problems. The headphones are still working great! There were only tiny issues like the adjustable area on the band eats my hair all the time because of the metal and since the headphones are white, the cord gets dirty easily (or dark) and the top part of the band has gotten darker too but it's not that noticeable. I was really worried about the cord because it's so thin and fragile looking but it's still in top notch shape and working!!"
50,I bought this to use with a 12 foot extension to my TV so I can watch TV at night without the sound bothering my wife in the other room. The sound is great and even sounds clearer than the sound that comes from my TV speakers .
51,I am really excited about this purchase. I ordered them to have when I travel next week for surgery. The items were shipped and delivered as promised. The headphones are pink and super cute. They fold up so they ate perfect for traveling. But..the most important issue. How do they sound? I hooked them up to my phone today to listen and they sound wonderful. I would order again.
52,"My daughter loves these headphones. She wanted something that went over her ears rather than earbuds and these fit the bill perfectly.
The song quality is very good according to my daughter and she loves the color. I can't the dang things off her, so they must be okay."
53,"This is the second pair of Edifier headphones I have purchased. The on-ear version is for the gym while the over the ear version is for mowing the lawn, etc. Both produce an excellent sound, especially with the base. This is surprising given their cost. A great deal!"
54,I love these headphones. I ordered them for travel but they have become my staple even listening to music in the office. They have great sound quality without the co-worker next to me listening to what I am listening to. They are a little snug on the ears but overall I love them!
55,"The headphones are nice and the sound quality is decent, but I'm frustrated as all get out that we can't seem to keep the foam covers on the ear pieces. I bought two pair for my daughters and both are having this problem. It's a royal pain to try and stretch the tiny piece of fabric over the plastic only to have it fall off at the drop of a hat. Grrr.!"
56,i'm very pleased with my purchase.am now lowering my volumn from 100% to 45 % on my laptop with even better quality !
57,"I got these to match my pink Kindle Fire case, and I'm very happy with them. The sound is fine for my purposes. I was looking for inexpensive and reliable, not for out of this world sound quality. The product does what I wanted it to do."
58,Sound is good and they do a decent job of noise cancelling. I wish the ear pieces were just a little but bigger but I knew they were on the small side when I bought them. Not bad for the price!
59,"Second pair I bought for my 7 year old. One for school, fits in desk. One for home/travel."
60,"Headphones arrived very quickly as promised. Wanted headphones that completely shut out ambient noise, these did the trick. Well satisfied with sound quality and padded ear pieces. Wife will be ordering hers on Wednesday. Really well made and work great."
61,"Excellent travel headphones! Lightweight, but with a great sound, keeps the room noise away pretty good in airplane! Smaller , but wits well adult and can be used for kids too! Perfect!"
62,"They work well with my computer and my CD player, but I bought them for my iPad, which they do not work with. I asked for headphones compatible with an iPad, these came up, chose them but can't use them with the iPad at all.It would be helpful if Amazon had a filter to guarantee we got products that fit the parameters we set."
63,The right ear phone didn't work! Now I have to return it. Big hassle!
64,"Well worth the money. Excellent sound quality, and after I got used to them, the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. So much so that sometimes I forget that they're on my head."
65,I am surprised of the good quality of sound and manufacturing..I purposely purchased the Edifier H650 to use as a travel set..leaving my more expensive set at home..I find this headset in a favorable comparison to my expensive set. Very Pleased
66,"Being a bass player I am very picky about headphone's sound quality. I personally own a 100+$ headphone, I bought this product as birthday gift to my best friend. I am very surprised by its great and clean sounds (for this price) and the quality of the product as a whole. It's just amazing!!! My friend absolutely loves it. It is both comfortable and cute. She has been using it for 5 month now and still very in love with it! Highly recommend this product!"
67,We have purchased three pairs of these headphones so obviously we like them! They function very well and are really comfortable on heads of various sizes. The choice of colors enables family members to quickly spot their own headphones. Great value.
68,"I love these headphones. Affordable, good sound, articulates every which way, and so fold up small enough to fit in my windbreaker pocket. If you don't want earbuds (like me) and you do want something to carry around with you, you should strongly consider these headphones. A great deal."
69,These are great. I bought them for my daughter for school. My husband and her fought over them ( before school started) on who was going to use them. I will be buying 2 more pairs.
70,Don't let the bright colors fool u! These r not ur avg kiddie headphones! The sound is impeccable!! Very clear n perfect balance of bass n treble. Bought one for each of my older kids. The ear muffs r a perfect size for their ears. Works for adults too but in my opinion better sized for older kids' ears. Excellent sound either way! Will purchase again!
71,"These work perfectly - so says the ten year old. She listens to music on her phone, movies on her tablet, and the phones keep out the world beautifully. Plus, they are great looking."
72,So far so good as we’ve just received them. Good sound and comfortable.
73,"Great little headphones I bought to replace my Sennheiser PX 100s. They fit over your ears so do block out external sound to a certain extent as well. Though my music does not sound as full as was with the Sennheisers, I am hoping that these will last longer since the PX 100s had a lifespan of about 2 years, tops! These Edifiers have thinner and more flexible wires so I am hopping that will give them a longer life. It is difficult now to find old school headphones without the inline microphone."
74,"I'm really enjoying using the Edifier headphones. They sound great and stay in place, with or without a ball cap! They're great for the gym...I hear what I want to hear and not all the machinery/equipment! My Edifiers have already replaced all those ear buds that are so distracting…constantly wiggling and falling out, never providing absolute sound we're searching for!
Thank You!"
75,My son loves these headphones. Great price and the sound quality is really good. I wish there was a way to limit the volume but that would be my only negative on these.
76,Sturdy and awesome hi-fi sound. Only had one day of use at work and it stood up well to bumps and bangs. I wish the bass was was a bit more but otherwise the sound is good. Really only gave four stars due to the lack of a strong bass sound but otherwise the sound is strong and probably DOES depend on the equipment it is plugged into. Small earpads still block a lot of outside noise and it doesn't seem to matter if they don't fit over the whole ear and even at low volumes blocks out external noise. Small and light and efficient. The metal reinforcement in the band is keeping the band from being in a state of breakability like my last headphones which broke on the first day of use due to a weak plastic band with no extra backing to keep them from snapping in two. Overall awesome and good noise-cancellation!
77,"Headband is too tight for a male adult head. After wearing for 5 minutes, these on the ear headphones made my ears uncomfortable and even sweaty. Do not recommend."
78,Love the sound quality. Just a little small for my ears which is the only reason it is not a five star rating
79,Headphones work great! used it to travel and work well in an airplane environment and doesn't disturb neighbors on the next seat even on full volume blast watching movies. doesn't take up much space either.
80,"My little girl loves the color, but the sound quality is poor."
81,"Great sound. Impressive, surprising lil thing. Not too bulky. Very neon. Good choice. Some sound leaks out for people around to hear if you listen as full blast as I do, may be irrelevant to others, and I use them anyway, so I took no stars off."
82,"Decent sound, fairly comfy. I wish it had a much longer cord. Since the cord is thin as well, one hard accidental jerk on it and I'm afraid it will break."
83,"Bought 2 pair for my tweens and they hurt after wearing them, even a short while. I would say they're a better fit for 5-8 y.o. Sound quality decent though."
84,"These are small headphones with very nice sound. They don't engulf the ear so that they block out other sounds, but they sit lightly on the ear without crushing the ear so that they can be worn for long periods of time. I can also slip them into my handbag if I go anywhere."
85,"Just received yesterday and have used for over three hours. Awesome, I mean awesome sound. Fit is comfy and secure. Adjustable to any age. Love the fun colors. Received a nice note from Fabian to make sure I received package. My best buy for 2017."
86,Attractive and comfortable. The sound is great! Just what I was looking for and the price was right.
87,"I bought these headphones for my 4 year old son to use with his tablet during a flight and they worked great! He said they were comfortable, they fit well on his head and he didn't have any problems hearing during the flight. He has used the headphones around the house and in the car and they have help us we'll through his less than gentle care. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for headphones for their young child."
88,"I was in need of headphones for traveling as I’m going on a trip this winter. I read some really good reviews here on Amazon and decided to buy these headphones. I was thoroughly impressed with the sound quality and comfort.

The Edifier H650 on-ear style headphones were shipped to me incredibly fast and in style. They came in a nice clear box that I couldn’t wait to open and start using them. The headphones are lightweight and really comfortable. Normally, I’m not a fan of on-ear style headphones however, I can wear these headphones for hours without them pinching or hurting my ears. The leather ear pads feel like pillows on my ears.

The sound quality is amazing. First off, these headphones have high quality noise-isolation, which is great for listening to music in loud places or just listening to them while commuting. Secondly, the sound from the headphones feels high quality. I use these for listening to all types of music and it feels like I’m right there in front of whoever is playing.

The H650 headphones are also very durable. I can just throw these headphones in my bag and not worry about them getting damaged. The wire is also made from a high strength wire.

I would definitely buy these headphones again without a doubt and it makes me curious as to what else Edifier has to offer."
89,"Love these. It's great to find a product that is good to it's description. Great price, really good sound."
90,I just recently had an opportunity to use the new headphones and they were excellent. I have a hear aid it I didn't have to use it while using the headphones which was a pleasant surprise. They are lightweight and will be great when we travel. I would recommend this product especially to the hearing impaired. Good job!
91,Very pleased with my purchase. Lightweight with excellent sound. Also the fact that they fold up and the ear phone part folds flat will make them excellent for packing on trips.
92,I love these head phones. They are way more than i expect them to be. i looked them so much i went and purchase an extra one for myself. my daughter and i are very pleased.
93,"Good value for the price, can make ears a bit sore after a while of wear. Definitely do a good job of blocking out MOST sound but not everything entirely, I use for studying"
94,"I was amazed by the sound quality of these headphones, I use them when hiking and they are lightweight and don't make your ears sweat like more encompassing headphones do."
95,"These are the great headphones at an affordable price. I've tried lots of them and these are light, comfortable and provide some sound buffering. My only wish is that they folded up a bit smaller."
96,"These head phones are great. they are super flexible, the sound is great for the price point and the white set is very sleek. If I could afford it, I'd be an audiophile. Until then, I recommend these headphones for others who would like an affordable headset that wont break easily and will still deliver great sound."
97,Decent sound for the price. All plastic. More of a children's set.
98,Fits well on a smaller individual and is the reason I purchased this headset. Has wonderful sound quality with no hissing or machine noise. Lightweight and adjustable. Would recommend it to friends.
99,"Work great until they break after a week or two. Cheap plastic, brittle."
100,I love my this earphones! so convenient to carry and fit just right on my ears!
101,I purchased it for my daughter to use when playing her keyboard and it was small and hard to keep on her head
102,"I am totally surprised and pleased with the quality of sound of these very reasonably priced on-ear headphones. I love them! They are light, comfortable, and sound great across the sound spectrum, not to weighted towards either high end or low. That they fold is really helpful, too. I'm very pleased with these... and as I say, surprised. They sound way better than their price would suggest."
103,"I am a big pink person, so I love the color, the headphones were really comfortable and great audio."
104,"These headphones are exactly what I wanted. The sound is wonderful and the size blocks outside noise, AND allows me to wear my glasses comfortably. i am very happy with this product."
105,"Good sound quality, in general. Lacking some more base, even after adjusting with a graphic equalizer. Headset is light, and pretty comfortable to wear, with good padding. A little bit on the small size, but you got to give up some ear-coverage for easier portability.. Seems strudy, but only used it today for the first time. Must check on durability in a few months."
106,Very comfortable fit achieved with the telescoping headband. Sound is terrific and soft pillows around the ears cancel most outside noises. I will biy again. The color is beautiful too. Very happy with this purchase.
107,They deliver good sound and fit comfortably; they do fold up somewhat and travel well.
108,"I just received these today. After a long process of reading reviews I finally hit the order button feeling I had nothing to lose based on price. I was looking for a pair of on ear headphones for dog walking, in the gym and running. THEY ARE FIERCE! As good, if not better than my $250 Sennheiser over the ear headphones. SO light, and just what I was looking for - an alternative to ear buds."
109,The headphone works fine all good only one issue I have and that is the ear piece it is small like for a 12 year old child. The ear piece doesn't cover my ear fully or snugged in a way that makes me feel comfortable. Well gift to a young nephew.
110,Amazing is the first word that comes to mind when describing these. The sound and clarity is very impressive . They are lightweight and not bulky like the other ones. These are the 2bd pair I bought
111,"These headphones are for my wife. She is thrilled with them. They are mainly for travel as they do fold up making them less cumbersome.
The packaging was perfect and the product fits comfortable on the ears."
112,These headphones are GREAT and my husband Loves them!
113,"The sound quality is amazing, and the design is great. I literally would have no qualms with these headphones if one ear didn't randomly stop working out of nowhere. It's such a shame too because I loved these."
114,"These headphones are amazingly priced and really help reduce the noise from those in my office who don't understand ""indoor voice."""
115,They work better than I thought at the price point! Very flexible too!
116,Great headphones. My daughter likes them very well and they fit her perfectly
117,"Love these headphones. They bring out the bass and some background sounds I've never notices before in songs. Pretty good noise cancellation and fit perfectly for an adult with a small head. The only negative is the pressure can hurt your head a little, but you need that seal to make them noise cancelling so its something you have to deal with and adjust them as needed for some relief."
118,Great headphones. My daughter loves them!! She has used them in computer lab at school and she says they sound. Good. She especially likes the color hooves!!!!
119,"So far (2 weeks perhaps) I have really enjoyed my Edifier headphones. They fit great, I like the single cord, and the sound is very good, although admittedly I am not much of an audiophile. They work great to drown out the bad music blaring at the gym. I am very pleased."
120,Super cheap quality. As expected.
121,Great sound and easy to travel with.
122,Sound quality is fine. Short wire and no volume control caused me to buy an extension wire with a volume control. Almost blew my eardrum out when connected to my computer and had a video start. Wire is also very fragile.
123,"I love these! I like these colors, as well!"
124,"I bought these as a more portable/foldable set of headphones for airplane flights. Because my headphones sometimes take some abuse while I travel, didn't want to 'break the bank' for my purchase. These were a great purchase! Super light-weight, Fold-up nice, and wow---the sound quality is SO MUCH MORE than expected! Great buy."
125,Sound very good for the price. All frequencies as complete and clear as can be expected. Only downside is they can be a bit uncomfortable after listening for long periods. Pads I guess could be softer and maybe bit bigger.
126,The headphones are very comfortable and there is no background noise at all.
127,"When I first unboxed these headphones I was a little skeptical. My first reaction was they looked ""cheap"". But for the awesome price I was not expecting them to be blingy anyway. As soon as I tried them I loved them! The sound quality far exceeded my expectations and they are so comfortable and light weight I can hardly tell I have them on. Over the years I have owned various pairs of earbuds and over the ear headphones. I have never found a pair of earbuds that I like at all. Over the ear phones are much more to my liking because they are just more secure. The only problem with every pair of over the ear is after a period of extended use they can make my ears sore, and/or hot and sweaty. Not the case at all with these, as they are light as air and do squeeze my ears the way others have. An added bonus, which I did not realize until today... It may have been mentioned in the description, I just didn't notice it if it was. The speaker on my Android cell phone quit working about a week ago. I had these headphones plugged into this cell so I could listen to some music on a road trip. I had a couple phone calls come in and the music stopped right away and I was able to answer the calls. My callers were able to hear me clear as a bell, no problem at all. I have spent a fortune on head phones over the years and I have to say these are by far the best ones I have ever owned in this price range. They are not as cheap as they originally liked when I first unboxed them.. They are just not as bulky as all of the others I have owned, which is why they are so comfortable and light weight. The only reason I have these 4 stars instead of 5 is because the only thing that would make them more perfect would be if they were Bluetooth. If you are considering purchasing these I would say go ahead. Best set of headphones in this price range. You won't be disappointed. I do plan on searching this company to see if they sale the same design but in Bluetooth."
128,My grandson loves them
129,These earphones are perfect. They are compact for travel purposes and work very well!
130,"Only one problem has come up with these phones. Only one day after receiving these headphones- for a duration of about an hour, the volume in my smartphone could not be heard with these plugged in, while unplugging the headphones resulted in sound.

Aside from this, they have proven a solid set of headphones unlike any others comparatively priced. They do an amazing job of isolating most sounds that distract from the listening experience. They fit over the ear and don't cause me discomfort.

Ordered these in my favorite color, orange. I appreciate the variety of colors we can choose from.

As for storage, I wear my backpack when attending school in the evenings, so when putting them away, they fold away nicely in the High Sierra Access backpack's top compartment specially designed for bigger headphones. Their simple design- no loose attachments or buttons- adds to their long life. Will attach photos later this week.

A more detailed review follows.

*Update 1.30.2017*

Bought these in mid February 2016 and love them.
They're so comfortable to wear that i even sleep with them on!

Unfortunately, 'this morning I awoke to find them off of my person.

In fact, I accidentally dislocated an earpiece, damaging one of the hinges.:'(

Fortunately, this happened within its one year warranty."
131,"The sound is good and they fold up very compact. The color is great. They are just a bit snug so if you have an average or big head, they might feel uncomfortable."
132,Work perfect at a great price.
133,Nice inexpensive headphones for my iPods. Good sound and comfortable fit. The folding feature makes them easy to transport..
134,"The reviews are accurate! I found the Edifier to be impressive at first blush. Good packaging, easy to remove from plastic box. I plugged it into my Mac book Pro and started playing a lot of different songs. The first thing I noticed was the transparency. The sound is clear and present. You might find yourself hearing things in the mix you didn't hear before. The highs are not overly accentuated and the lows are balanced for an even response overall. If you are looking for headphones that boost the lows this isn't the unit for you. The cord is thinner than some so you need to take care of it. As reported in other reviews the phone fit quite snugly your head and that is a factor when wearing headsets for long periods but that snugness also gives you good separation from outside noise. That said, extending the band fully will reduce the tightness of fit and makes it more comfortable. If you like clear and balanced sound this is a great product, especially for the money.
Update: I have had these headphones for over a year now. They are still in great shape and continue to work flawlessly! Very please with this purchase and would purchase again if I needed another pair."
135,"Light weight, good sound quality, comfortable to wear."
136,Really good headphones for the price. Clear sound. Comfortable to wear. Happy customer!
137,"Nice product. A bit snug, but prob necessary for the outer noise reduction. I would have liked a bit longer cord. Overall, the sound quality is nice as is the price."
138,I got these for my granddaughter for Christmas who is 10. I was surprised by how well the sound came through. She was pleased and I was satisfied that the cost was worked for me. Finding a good resonable priced music source to work with it did not work as well.
139,I have only had these for a few days but loved the improved sound while listening to shows on my tablet I heard things I would have never heard just listening to it through the regular speakers. Also they are really comfortable.
140,Very good
141,"The quality is fantastic!! It's definitely worth every penny, very comfortable to use and the sound is MAGNIFICENT."
142,"Bought this for my 9 year old daughter and she really likes them. They are lightweight and fit her well. Also fits me and sounds goods too.They seem well built, especially when compared to the cheap junk that I have seen around. These are much better quality and am confident they will last a long time."
143,Very poorly made.
144,"These were a gift for my wife. These are not over the ears headphones, but padded ones that sit on the ear. These are exactly what she wanted."
145,My 12 year old son says he would rate these as 4 stars. He says they are a little small for him.
146,These earphones fit well and provide excellent sound.
147,I am very impressed with these headphones. The sound is so clear and I am very hard of hearing.. Thank you!
148,"I bought these for my 13 year old daughter. She said they are comfortable, fit well, and the sound quality is good. They arrived quickly and in good condition. She is happy, so I am happy."
149,"They sound great, block a lot of background noise. Ear cushions are comfortable."
150,Easy to use for a child of 6! Soft cushions for ears!
151,"When I first put it on it felt too tight, but after streching and moving it on my head it it felt OK. The sound from my CD was better than any of my other earbuds have. I didn't know when but I feel asleep listing to my ""Go to Sleep"" CD. and I felt very comfortable when I woke up with the Headphones still on. 2nd Note
Last night I had a bad ""Shock"" feeling from the Headphones. The side without the Conecter gave me a ""Sharp buzz Sting"" on the side of my Head. above the Phones. I do not want to put them on again."
152,These are extremely comfortable and provide excellent sound quality.
153,"Great headphones for the price. They are very comfortable and easy to adjust. I use them in the evenings to listen to books on Audible, and they work great."
154,I bought these to travel with. They are very flexible and easy to fold. And I like the fact that they don't fully cover the ear as they seem to be more comfortable than that type of headphone.
155,"VERY PLEASED with sound quality . I wear these 4 to 5 hours a day at work , I also wear glasses , I do lift the temple of the glasses above the ear pads so they do not press against my ears. Back to the sound , clear and good bass NOT over powering . Does block out enough outside noise so I do not have to increase the volume , They will not block out noise on an Airplane. People around me cannot hear what I am listening to. AGAIN 5 STARS and would recommend . THANK you Amazon"
156,Sound quality is pretty terrible. I know they're inexpensive but having halfway decent sound is indeed possible with headphones at this price point. The head piece is well designed however and they are comfortable to wear. I expected more from edifier honestly.
157,I got these as a gift foe someone and they really like them.
158,This product stopped working on the second day. The quest for a quality headphone continues....
159,"Its only been a couple of months, and the Left ear no longer works."
160,"I gave these headphones as a gift to a friend who's doing a lot of traveling. He says these headphones sound great, fold flat... He was pleased with my choice!"
161,"My 8 year old daughter has had these for a couple of days now and she is very happy with them. They isolate the sound nicely and they are comfortable. Perfect size for her too. They look like good quality, strong headphones."
162,"Decent headphones. Works well, sound is clear and sharp. Worth the price paid."
163,"Just the right size with great sound. Arrived quickly, great product for the money"
164,Just received mine today and am very happy. Sound quality is comparable to a more expensive headset. For the price you can't go wrong.
165,"My seven year old is thrilled about these headphones. They work well with with iPad and Kindle. Personally, I think sound quality is okay -- there's too much treble, but easily remedied through iTunes. The headphones do no't completely fold down even though there are hinges. All in all, happy with my purchase."
166,"These are great easy on the ears you can wear them for long periods, no problem. They seem to block out outside noise very well."
167,great sounding headphones
168,Got this for my kid. Loves it. Color is nice and bright. Foldable design saves space. Good sound.
169,These are nice headphones but they are on the small side as far as covering the ears go.
170,INEXPENSIVE AND GOOD !!
171,I received the headphones and I am very happy with them. They are comfortable and the sound is very good. Very happy with the product. Thank you. Lucy
172,"Bought these headphones to replace my ear buds. Was immediately surprised by the quality of sound that I previously wasn't hearing. To test out the noise cancelation feature I wore them on the Metro. I couldn't hear the train, the speaker, or anybody on the train. Plus the headphones fold and fit into my jacket pocket. Definitely a great purchase."
173,"The headphones are very comfortable and the sound is fine. They were shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.
I haven't tried them on an airplane yet but will soon and hope they will help deafen the engine noise,"
174,Love my new headphones. I needed them in order to enjoy viewing my shows and listening to YouTube with disturbing my husband. He loves that I got them too😀
175,"Outstanding sound, great value"
176,The Edifier H650 headphones is for anyone. So my son needed new headphones. Thus far the sound quality is great! I plan to purchase a second pair for back-to-school supplies.
177,Fantastic sound! I like them better than a pair of smaller Sennheisers I bought for three times the price about 8 years ago.
178,"The headphones are great! They fold in to take up less space and the sound is really good. I used them on a recent trip and they blocked out all other noise. Definitely worth the cost, and I love the color!"
179,Great head phone. Light and clear.
180,"Really compact and easy to travel with. The sound is great! Does not require batteries, which is really nice!"
181,"Just got these headphones on Sunday and have been trying them out around the house and at the gym. They work beautifully! Nice and light. Small ""footprint"" so it's great for traveling. Great sound and good noise cancellation. Fantastic price!"
182,"Sound great. Exactly what I was looking for: lightweight, foldable, but covering the ear with a comfortable pad. I hate earbuds, they never fit my ear. These will be great for travel."
183,LOVE these headphones! The sound is amazing for the price! Totally blocked out any outside noises and fit comfortably! The cord is just the right length for my MP3 player and the fact that they are adjustable is great. Very happy with this purchase.
184,Cute color and light weight. They almost muffle the outside sound. Great for the price.
185,Great head phones for the priece.
186,"Purchased for my 11 year old sister and she loved them! I can't speak for the quality of the sound as I did not try them out, but the headphones themselves seemed very well made and the color (purple) was exactly as pictured. Loved the fact that the headband is adjustable. Packaging was great too, very high quality and perfect for gift-giving."
187,"I purchased these as a gift for my ten year old son and like them so much I will likely go back and buy a pair for myself. They are not only very comfortable, but the sound quality is great - bonus that they fold up for travel."
188,"Nice headphones, just small. I did notice that it said it would fit a child too, but didn't expect them to be that small on my ears. Either way, I do like them and my daughter loves them."
189,I lobe these headphones. Really great stereo.
190,I watched 4 movies in a row on the plane back from Asia. My only complaint is that it fits tightly on my head and I don't have a big head.
191,as good as my bose and not as cumbersome
192,"Confortable, perfect size, nice colors, we very satisfied. This is our 2nd pair. We like it and recommend! Great price!"
193,The sound good. I am satisfied. They look cool too.
194,"Not the most expensive headphones available, but certainly among the best. I gave a set to my husband, so he can listed to his
iTunes music on his iPhone. The sound is beautiful. I'm very pleased."
195,Nice product. The part which covers the ears folds back into the headband which makes storage easier. But the ear piece doesn't completely cover the ear for reduced background noise.
196,Good sound great color. Granddaughter loves them.
197,Sound quality wasn't as good as I had hoped. Ended up getting broken because the cord got loose and the headphones no longer put out sound.
198,The headset is plain and simple the way I like it. I started buying the audio version of some e-books. After reading a lot all day it is great to sit back sometimes and just listen.
199,I purchased these for my grandkids. They appear to work great and be able to with stand the use of little ones.
200,My 6 year old likes these a lot. She says they are comfortable and they stay on her head great. The sound is even decent.
201,"The sound is pretty good on these earphones, especially the highs. I stopped using them because they hurt my ears after time. I ended up buying a set of over-the-ear headphones."
202,my girlfriend love them... Love the vibrant color.
203,"These little headphones are great - they are small, light and have good sound. They are adjustable as well. It is hard for me to understand why a headphone manufacturer wouldn't allow for all different sizes of heads --- I just returned the Sennheiser headphones because they were enormous and non adjustable. I have some small Bose headphones that were triple the price of these - and I feel these are comparable.
I hate clamshell packaging, but was very pleasantly surprised to see that both pieces of plastic had the 'running arrows' and I will recycle the
packaging. Thank you Edifier for your earth conscious packaging."
204,Very good sound. Fits well with an adjustable headband.
205,"Bought 2 of these for our children and they look, fit, and sound fantastic! The sound quality is excellent and they don't feel ""cheap"", but they are flexible enough for children to handle. I would definitely recommend them!"
206,"This headphones are a great balance between quality and price. You really can't get better.
Sound is great and though materials are not very expensive, they are good quality and seem durable. The folding design is very convenient."
207,They feel good and give good sound. But I bought them to use on an airplane so we'll see how they work in that environment.
208,"Great design, can carry them in a brief case, adjustable headband is important because of hair (or lack of) for the user. Have not tried for quality yet, but that is not as important for their intended use on airplanes and mobile devices."
209,This is a gift. Haven't given it to my grandson yet but I know he will love it.
210,Work well and price was good.
211,Nice headphones at good price
212,These are very nice and have good sound. My only disappointment is in myself. I thought I was ordering a pair that had volume control and mic on the cord. But they didn't. But they are nice enough that I am going to keep these and just order a 2nd pair with the desired controls.
213,"I got these for working out on a treadmill, and they are perfect! They're lightweight but fit snuggly on my ears. I love them!"
214,"These headphones have great sound quality and are very good looking, but they begin to hurt my ears after using them for extended periods of time."
215,Perfect! Our granddaughter was happy .
216,Great quality sound. Love how clear and loud it sounds. Very light weight and easy to put on. Folds up great for travel and to fit in your bag. I am very happy with these. you will love them.
217,"Good sound and quality, but the on-ear part is too small for the ears"
218,these work great!
219,"They work good. Nothing special, wife likes the color. They r light on your head."
220,"I have tried many different types of ear/headphones, trying to find the right one that suits my needs. And I believe I finally have them! Besides being a great color (purple is my favorite), they are comfortable, have a very good sound, and are easily transportable. Would I recommend them to a friend? You bet!"
221,"I was searching for headphones that are portable, sound good, and are reasonably priced. I am very pleased with the Edifier H650 headphones, they are exactly what I was looking for!"
222,"These headphones work wonderful. The sound is amazing for how small the headphones are. My only complaint is that the part that goes on your ears isnt that big. I like my headphones to cover my ears. However, the sound quality is amazing so they are keepers."
223,"Great headphones for my kids. They bend, fold, flex and take all sorts of handling in stride, whether it’s sitting at the table or being stuffed in a drawer full of toys. The colors are extra fun!"
224,Used these during a difficult dental procedure and they were wonderful! Can't wait to use them again when I am traveling!
225,My son loves these headphones. Very comfortable.
226,"Product arrived as stated and in perfect condition. Opened pkg immediately, plugged into my I-phone, sat back and enjoyed the sweet sounds. Would recommend to friends."
227,"Just a great pair of headphones. Bought for my son, who is always losing his, so the bright orange color was perfect. If he doesn't set them way back on his head, they tend to fall off when he is leaning forward, but that might just be because he's a child."
228,Terrific sound quality
229,Great sounding headphones for this price category.
230,"love them so far. no frills, good sound that keeps me entertained at the office. they are not clunky which is also great for the office (limited space desk and such)"
231,Great headphones.
232,Great sound and they fold to put in your gym bag
233,Love them .
234,"The Edifer H650 are awesome, the quality of these are on point. I could not believe the sound. I have a pair of Bose that don't sound this good. They have a great full range with deep bass. Great for blocking out your surroundings and jamming out. 9 out of 10 rating.
Daniel B."
235,"These sit on the ear instead of around it, but the earpiece is soft. The fold flat and are easy to slip in my carry on. Great sound, even the bass."
236,"They cancel out anything else, my kids love them!"
237,"I bought these for working out, as I don't like earbuds while working out and these seemed compact and streamlined. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, and I hardly noticed they were there during my workout. I might get a second pair for everyday use :)"
238,Quality of sound is poor. Not worth the money. Also received a retuned item from the seller. Returning.
239,I'm enjoying my Birthday head phones. They sound great there not to tight on my ears.
240,Comfortable and inexpensive! I was surprised at the sound and how light they are. I am so happy that I decided on these over the more expensive ones. I will be using these for my summer travel.
241,"awesome! Built sturdy, my 8 year old loves these!"
242,It seems a little small and isn't noise cancelling.
243,These headphones perform well. The noise cancelling is noticeable. The design folds up well. They are lightweight ... will have to see how the design holds up over time.
244,"As described, very satisfied"
245,these headsets are just what I was looking for - small and lightweight. BONUS is the price and they sound great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive small lightweight pair of headphones.
246,"Purchase 6 month ago, its broken. Good sound, light weight, comfortable."
247,Great value.
248,"Been using earbuds but just got a VR system so I thought I'd try some ear phones. These are incredible, clear, crisp sound. Very comfortable and easy to adjust. My wife wants a pair now so will buy again."
249,Perfect for my needs as I now have hearing aids and can no longer use ear buds.. Good quality sound. Good price. Nice fitting. Works with my I-Pod Shuffle and my portable radio.
250,"Wonderful headphones. They are lightweight and their design makes it easy to wear for long periods without hurting your ears. Therefore, they are very goods for my kids too."
251,these headphones were just what I was looking for. I have to wear them all day as an electronic court reporter and they are very comfortable and have excellent sound. they seem very sturdy and easy to adjust.
252,Great priced head phones. Perfect for travel and work great.
253,"Pro - Sound very good, clear with enough bass. Light and comfortable, easy to forget you have them on. Con - cord is thin and a bit short, I worry about accidentally damaging it. Overall, it's a good buy at $20ish."
254,I am extremely happy with the product. I plug into my i pod and the sound is amazing. Absolutely no complaints. The shipping time was very quick also.
255,Broke after 6 months of use. Can't hear out of right ear piece.
256,"Good sound, lightweight design, and comfortable."
257,"Hi, thanks they are light and sound is really really good!"
258,Excellent for my husband to use with his kindle. He has hearing aids in both ears and cannot use earbuds. Most headphones just didn't work. These do.
259,"Great sound, great price, folds down for easy storage, bright orange color is fun and keeps people from talking to me at the gym while I'm working out. Also, they stay on well when I'm moving around a lot."
260,The right headphone stopped working 6 weeks after I bought the item! This product has no endurance
261,"Good fit for a 5 year old. We got these headphones in orange to match an orange iPad case, so he's very happy."
262,"The earcups don's extend very far -- barely get out to reach my ears -- and the sound isolation is quite incomplete. But the the music reproduction is really very good, a large improvement over the iPhone earbuds."
263,Just what I was looking for. Thank you!
264,Nice color and excellent sound plus delivery was quick . Two thumbs up !!
265,"These headphones are Compact, Lightweight and Secure. They fold easily and the cord is not too long or short. Very Comfortable Fit with Excellent Sound Quality!"
266,"Fantastic headphones - especially considering the low price, the sound quality is exceptional. Likewise, the ability to fold them in a way that doesn't feel like they're going to snap is really nice for portability. No complaints whatsoever."
267,Love the design and the sound is very clear. A very good purchase for the price.
268,"The sound quality is good and they seems well made. However, if your like me, they will make your ear warm pretty quickly. If that's not an issue for you, then you should be good"
269,Finally a set of headphones my daughter loves!
270,Bought these for my 9 year old daughter who has gone through lots of headphones. These have held up well and are still working fine. They are sturdy and the sound quality is good for the price.
271,"Fast shipping, good quality headphones!"
272,Bought for my autistic son and they are perfect! Very comfortable and lightweight. Will buy again!!
273,Fits comfortable. Great sound quality.
274,"They are the best head phones I have ever had.
They exceed a pair of Yamaha head phones I bought in 1977 for $100.00"
275,These are sturdy and durable and strong - enough for my 1st grade rambunctious boy to get a full school years worth of use out of them!
276,"Was surprised of the size was smaller than depicted in the ad but it pack a real punch, was very impressed with the sound quality."
277,I bought these for my niece and they look great! I don't know about quality yet but so far so good.
278,Pretty disappointed. Head phones arrived today and only one of the speakers work. Needed them for this weekend during our sons airline trip. Now what.
279,"The headphones are comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and the sound quality is very good."
280,"My son loves them and says they sound AWESOME! Great customer service too, they want to know your feedback on them, so I received a personal email from the manufacturer/CEO."
281,"I really like these headphones. They sound great, and they are made nice and sturdy. I also like how they fold up."
282,"Great for travel in a crowded bus. A lot of noise is filtered out. They are not as bulky as some headphones, and the sound is great. This was a lucky purchase, and I'm thinking about gifting a couple of family members."
283,Bought them as a gift and was told that they are excellent
284,Great quality.
285,"Yes, these are terrific--- it's easy to knock them off at the gym, but they drown out the lunks a bit. Nice sound for the price---"
286,Worked well for 3 hours then the wire came out of headphones..
287,"Good quality. Beautiful pink for a 9 year old. Will be used at school, hoping it will last longer though."
288,"Great headphones! Compact, foldable design doesn't compromise sound quality. Bonus points for having unbelievably good customer service !! Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
289,"Sound is great , happy with product"
290,"I love them so far! Sound is excellent, although it sounded a little strange on my computer but I'm wondering if the video I was watching was the culprit."
291,Awesome sound and awesome comfort
292,My grandson still has small ears and doesn't like the buds. He really likes these. States the sound quality is good too.
293,"Light, good sound, very happy with them."
294,Good sound the bass wasn't so great.
295,"Love it, works great"
296,Daughter loves them
297,"So far so good. I use them for running (don't you hate pushing the buds back in your ear over and over again?) and they haven't disappointed. Good range of sound, stay where they were placed, and very flexible in a gym bag."
298,"Work very well and the sound is excellent, for the money these are great. Daughter loves them for all her audio."
299,Used on airplanes and worked great. Comfortable.
300,"The headphones are comfortable, but the sound goes in and out. Quite annoying."
301,Wow! Nice sound for the price. My ears can only handle the volume at 70 and I'm 27 years old with no sensitivity to sound.
302,"Clarity is very good and size and comfort are perfect.
I would order again if ever needed!"
303,"These headphones come in some awesome colors. Best of all, is how lightweight they are and how amazing the sound quality they have. These are an excellent purchase."
304,I love these headphones!
305,"We like these headphones. They were exactly what we were looking for. We wanted an inexpensive but comfortable set of headphones to use on airplanes to substitute for those very uncomfortable and very poor quality ear bud types that airlines are using more and more often. You also never know just how well they have been cleaned between uses, if at all. These headphones are well made and good quality for the money. Their sound quality was much better than we had expected. They can be folded down to a very manageable size for travel purposes. We also purchased a two-prone converter (for those planes that still use this outdated design) and a small bag to hold the headphones. Our only ""design"" related comment to the manufacturer ... it would have been nice if the extenders on the headphones would have been a little longer to fit over people with larger heads or those with a very full head of hair. They are still comfortable but just a ""hair"" tight even when fully opened. Just a suggestiom. This is not a significant concern I am sure for the majority of people."
306,Great headphones for the price. Use them for walking and elliptical machine.
307,"The headphones are light, sturdy, and inexpensive -- just what I was looking for to use while traveling."
308,They're good!
309,"Great headphones, kids love it"
310,My daughter loves her new headphones. She uses them all the time and has no complaints she says. Thank you!!
311,"good sound quality, fairly compact"
312,These are excellent headphones.
313,"Great sound, very lightweight and adjustable for any size. Don't really like ear buds, found these extremely comfortable (don't even know they are on your head) and block out the background noise."
314,Seems like a great headphone.
315,Better than I expected....Quiet when I use them...
316,Bought each of my daughters a set of these headphones for their birthday. Fabulous value. Great sound! Super cute colors. They have been a big hit.
317,We bought these for our special needs son for Christmas. He LOVES them. They are perfect size and fold up nicely. The sound is amazing and clear. We are very pleased.
318,"Great headphones, the sound quality is awsome, the ear cups are soft and relaxing not pinching. Great purchase for the price paid and quality recieved."
319,"Very happy with these headphones. They are light, durable, and a nice packable size. Great product at a reasonable price."
320,"Amazing headphones. i use them daily and for the price, it has some great sound. If anyone is looking for a cheap headphone to travel around with, this would be the go-to"

325,love them very clear. they don't fall off when i go running
326,Used only once so far. Comfortable and great sound quality.
327,everything exactly as advertised.....very happy with purchase.
328,The headphones give adequate sound for their size and price. I was originally led to believe that they had some sound canceling abilities and was told that I would have to spend a lot more money to receive that feature.
329,They fit well and the sound was very good
330,The sound is amazing I may get another
331,"These headphones have been a hit with the kids on our travels. The volume level seems good. The fit is better than the last set of headphones we used for them, which kept sliding off the front or back of their heads. The extension mechanism that allows you to adjust the fit of the headphones is also sturdy and holds once it is set. Other headphones we tried were not reliable that way. The ear pieces rotate and fold inward making them easy to pack away. Happy with the purchase at the price we paid."
332,Light weight. Sound is good.
333,"I just received these in the mail last week and so far I love them! They're way more durable than the earbuds I was using and they're so reasonably priced! Great quality, great product!"
334,I bought these for the kids and they are perfect for them!
335,small sized headphones...great for my 10 year old. fold for travel.
336,Wear while mowing. Love them

340,"comfortable, folds flat for storage and travel, nice sound."
341,My child has only used it once but they fit great and the sound is clear.
342,"Sounds great, comfortable, I ordered another for my son."
343,These work so Great! My kids love them and I didn't have to pay the price of beats :)

441,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the Edifier H650 headphones. I am an art student and I like to listen to music in class. However, it was a pain to take earbuds out each time the instructor had something to say. These fit well, they sound really good, and they are easy to take along with my to school. I am not a connoisseur of this type of equipment by any measure. However, I do know that they sound as good or better than any similar equipment that I own. I haven't had any problems with durability, but for the reasonable price, I don't sweat it too much. I have recommended this product to other students in my classes and I would do the same for you."
442,good
443,The sound is good. The color is beautiful.
444,Headphones are great.
445,I bought them for my daugther. She loves it.
446,Excellent quality and came fast before Xmas
447,"very comfortable, great sound"
448,"I pretty much like everything about these headphones, especially given the price point. They are super comfortable for hours of wear when I'm studying and as an easily distracted person, I enjoy the amount that they muffle my surroundings. The packaging was easy to open and it arrived on time. I'm not much of an audiophile but the sound quality is really great for my purposes. I also enjoy the way they fold up - I've had other headphones get super bent out shape trying to put them in my backpack, and these fold flat to eliminate that problem."
449,"I am so pleased with these headphones. For such a low price imagine my surprise when I put them on and heard the awesome range of frequencies that provided a beautiful, rich sound. They also reduce outside noises which allows total absorption of the beautiful, clear sound that they produce. Awesome buy."
450,"Nice color, but breaks easily like everything these days."
451,"These are terrible ≈and the seller is even worse. First, they are much smaller than you would think - about the size of airplane headphones. Because the earphone is small, it is not very comfortable. Worse, they only worked in one ear, and we were out of town so we missed the return window. I contacted the seller to see about returning these since they are defective - no response. I will have to take this up with Amazon"
452,"Was looking to find a replacement for my beloved AKG-K404 headphones, which are now discontinued.

The sound on these is decent and they're comfortable, but the balance on my headphones is really bad. The left ear is about 30% quieter than the right ear, which tells me these are pretty cheap if that's an issue out of the box."
453,"I ended up liking the amazon basics headphones better. These felt small on my ears and I don't have big ears. I thought the amazon basics had about equivalent sound quality but were cheaper, more comfortable, fit better and looked better."
454,"I got these Edifier headphones for my son. He's in grade school and they use Chromebooks. So of course I got him a Chromebook and these headphones for Christmas. All three (my son, the Chromebook, and these Orange Edifier H650 Cans) look great together. Learning in style!

It's obvious that these headphones were designed to appeal to kids and teens, boy or girl, or anyone else who likes things that sport fun, bright colors. They have an understated coolness factor to them. They're just fun looking; I can't state it any other way. Slap a Disney logo on them along with a Frozen Princess to either side and you've got yourself a million dollar selling item here. They're not a cheap plastic toy, but they are very much toy-like.

They're smaller than I imagined. Again, they seem to be designed mainly for kids in this regard. I thought my pair of JBL cans I bought a few months ago were small, but my JBLs are behemoths compared to these Edifiers. Again, perfect for kids or teens.

Although they are smaller and more compact than regular headphones, these cans have plenty of headband adjustment. I can get them around my big man-melon quite easily. And the smaller-sized cups cover up just enough of my ears to keep out a lot of outside noise - like typing on a keyboard for instance.

I like them, I'll have to admit. They're just neater than heck. And the colors - orange here - look amazing! Fun and vibrant. I couldn't be happier.

Some things to note:
The cable cannot be removed and replaced. So if it ever gets ruined, then the cans are done for.
Although the headphones are small, you can still fold them up into an even more compact state; you can stow them in your overstuffed backpack without much fuss that way.
The ear pads are soft but tough.
The headband does have a bit of padding; it's rubbery instead of cushion-y. It's not much, but it is there.

Let's talk quality of sound: Obviously with such a cheap retail price, audiophiles might as well stop reading right -HERE- and move on to Bose or Sennheiser or whatever else is available because these headphones are not up to snuff. They possess an unbalanced sound profile that leans heavily toward the treble and upper mid-range. BUT, BUT, BUT, with a little help from your iPOD's EQ, they can be evened out quite easily by bumping up the low frequencies. This creates what I would describe as a full, bright, rich sound that brings out the best cymbal crashes and drum hits on any rock track. Vocals really stand out. It's quite startling at first.

If you have the means to boost the bass, then these headphones will surprise you with their lively, raw, unadulterated sound - bright and lively looking to boot! The price can't be beat. Highly Recommended!

Easter Egg: Three dots in Braille means L,,,,or left."
455,"The Edifier H650 Hi-Fi On-Ear Foldable Noise-Isolating Headphone are as depicted in the photos and described in the specifications.
At first blush the headphones look flimsy, made mostly of plastic with a flexible reinforcing bar in between the over-the ear headphones that are padded with fake leather, and a thin cord. The headband is adjustable to fit most size heads. The headphone folds on itself for convenient portability or storage.
But the first impression is deceptive. These are terrific headphones! The sound is crisp and crystal clear, the bass is as good as my Skull Candy Crusher, Bose and Sony (much more expensive) headphones; the highs, lows and mid-ranges are distinct at all volumes.
The Edifier H650 are very lightweight and comfortable to wear for a long time. Very good noise reduction.

In my opinion, the Edifier H650 headphones have very good sound transmission equal to much more expensive name brands. Their durability may be in question, but at their price, it would be nit-picking.

I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
456,"They are not ""noise-isolating"" as described."
457," I actually AM surprised at how much I like these. They are very lightweight, I chose the orange color and they are definitely better in person than they are in the pictures on the product page.

They are easily portable because they are so light, and for the price I really wasn't expecting them to sound as clear as they do.

The earpieces have real leather around them, and even though the band is made from plastic, there is a little wire metal band in them for stability. But they are foldable, and easy to carry.

I like them and would definitely recommend them. Especially for the price and the quality that you get.

Promotional or discounted product provided to review."
458,I have a pair of cheaper head phones that is much better than these for noise reduction. Also the head strap is too short. Will not buy again.
459,It came with a short in the cable
460,Works good. Fits a small head.
461,Excellent for the price. Comfortable and great sound.
462,"Great product, they were for a 12 year old so they worked great but for an adult they would be alittle small."
463,"These headphones performed as advertised . . . excellent sound, very good ambient noise control, and a quality look and feel.
I consider the Edifier H650 to be an excellent value."
464,too small. ONLY for children. doesn't get very loud either.
465,"Good to use, attractive color!"
466,I Love The Lightweight Headphones :) :) :) :)
467,"These headphones were delivered in a short period of time, did not break the bank and have great sound quality!"
468,Very happy with the headphones. It is a gift so hopefully he will like it also.
469,"It was what I expected, for the price you can not beat it. Eli from boca raton Fl."
470,"Couldn't use with my ipad.
The earphones were comfortable"
471,Sounds great. Nice OREGON STATE orange
472,"These headphones are very good quality, especially for the price."
473,good sound for the price
474,"These are a Christmas gift for my husband, so they haven't been opened yet. Will have to submit another review once he has tried them."
475,"I have worked with a lot of headphones and I have seen a lot of variety amongst them in terms of quality, comfort, features and sound profile. Edifier is a new name to me; I have worked with many different headphones from numerous manufacturers but I had never heard of Edifier until I was asked to consider trying these for a review. My overall impression of these headphones is good. That said, there is a weakness in the sound profile that merits mention.

These are very lightweight, on-ear headphones. I personally prefer over-the-ear headphones but that's a preference based on comfort and fit. For on-ear phones these are actually comfortable and they fit nicely and do not make my ears hurt. If more on-ear phones were like these, I would be a lot more open to them. That said, I still prefer over-the-ear phones.

These are listed as noise isolating headphones (also known as passive noise canceling) and I was surprised to see that they indeed do block out a fair amount of ambient sound. These are a far cry from ANC phones like Bose but that's not the point with these. That they do such a good job of blocking out noise and are on-ear phones says a lot.

These are made well and appear solid. The one weak spot is the cable which is permanently attached and is insulated in a plastic coating. If any part of these phones is going to fail, it likely will be the cord. That said, I would not base my evaluation of these solely on the cable.

The most important aspect of a set of phones is the sound profile. Here is the one area where these could be improved. The highs are strong and clear and you can hear plenty of detail. The midrange is good and the music has the right depth. Where these come up short is actually the bass which is weaker than I would like. I do not like the heavy, driving bass that is the current trend, so the absence of bass really catches my attention. With an equalizer I can get the bass strong enough, but I do not always have an equalizer (even a software based equalizer) at my disposal. So, this tells me these excel at podcasts and non-music listening.

These are good headphones, for certain purposes. They are very comfortable – more so than most on-ear phones I have used – and they sound decent for spoken broadcasts like podcasts, lectures and the like. The bass is a soft spot, but otherwise these are good and are worth their asking price.

Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it."
476,"I have a few pair of in ear headphones, and while those are great.. Sometimes you just want to cancel all noise out instead of just adding it in. These headphones are absolutely perfect for that. I have pretty small ears so much headphones usually completely envelop my ears and feel very heavy on my head, I do not have that problem at all with these. They are completely lightweight and I can barely feel them resting on top of my head, and the earpiece is just big enough so that I can hear just my music and nothing else without being too big and sliding off. Not to mention the material surrounding the earpiece is very soft and comfortable. For storage purposes these headphones can fold into themselves so that they can be put away without getting hung up on anything and needing too much space. I actually think that the ear pieces are small enough that they’ll fit my son as well rather than having to pay an arm and a leg for a kids pair. As for sound quality, I have no complaints. The sounds was crisp and clear without any distortion and the bass was right where it should be. My only problem is that my son keeps trying to take them… I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
477," A great entry model of headphones for those simply looking for a solution to get sound from that isn't going to sound bad or cause any discomfort. Great for young kids or anyone looking to avoid spending too much. You have multiple colors to choose from and the colors are really bright (if that's what you're into). They offer a basic level of sound and even a little bit of bass. If you are looking for more than that though, you would be interested in looking into one of their more expensive models.

As mentioned, bass levels are minimal but present unlike most headphones at this price. Typically, you find that you need to spend closer to $40-50 before you start hearing a decent enough bass presence for it to be noticeable. The H650's do offer that decent enough bass presence, so you can hear more out of your music than just a tinny pair of entry phones that you'd expect.

Mids and highs are also average but present. They aren't horribly tinny or muffled or anything, you just won't experience incredible crisp highs and deep lows. For that, again, you will have to spend a little more money for a better model from Edifier--which they have plenty to choose from."
478,"These headphones are super! Over the years I've used an abundance of headphones, ear buds and so forth. So why do I like these so much? Excellent fidelity. Sharp looking. Great fit on my head. on-the-ear fit is perfect. They fold up for easy carry and storage. No complaints and no suggestions on this excellent equipment! No, I don't work for the company. Don't know anyone who does. This is just me shooting from the hip."
479,"I returned these headphones because they are too small. I got a headache almost immediately from the pressure on my ears. I do wear a size 7 3/8 man's hat, so maybe petite women would not have this issue. I appreciate Amazon's return policy, including free shipping."
480,"Headphones are pretty important here in our family. We use them to block out noises so we can concentrate on the task at hand. I am in love with my new Edifier Headphones. The version I have is H650, they are perfect for traveling!

I am sitting here with a pair on my head listening to my radio app and just loving the sounds that is coming through. The bass sounds incredible. I mean, I am listening to Mama, :""I'm Coming Home"" from Ozzy, and the bass and treble are just amazing. I am really blown away by it.

I have the blue pair, and I am just so impressed with how bright the color is, how comfortable they are on my ears, how the sound quality is, and even the length of the thin cord is nice. I received a pair for free for review."
481,"These are small headphones and they have a pretty good tension on them, which makes them a little on the tight side. I knocked a star off because of that. The ear cups are also small. Other than those issues, I found them well made and they seem to be durable. I've sat on them a couple of times and they survived. The weight is pretty good for an over the head construct. Some of those kind are really heavy, but these aren't. The sound is good, too. I paid $50 for a pair of headphones that have comparable sound to these. I am very picky about headphones as I wear them for hours on end on a daily basis for work and entertainment, so it really is unfortunate the above issues exist. They really should be sold as children's headphones."
482,I expected more
483,"This are good, but be aware that the earpads are actually not as large as I expected. They maybe barely cover my adult ear, as opposed to the larger size I was expecting. I guess maybe this is why they are advertised as for children and adults. Also, they seem to leak more sound then the earphones I had previously...other people can hear something at lower sound volumes than a headset I had previously. However, all in all, these are decent for use at the gym, so I am happy with them. They also shipped quickly!"
484,"Edifier’s H650 over the ear headphones provide really good quality sound with nice coverage of midrange tones, with a decent amount of base. The round ear pads are a little small, so they need to be properly positioned to block ambient sounds, and get the best results.

These lightweight phones are currently available in white, blue, orange, pink, and black, and would be fine for most styles of music from metal to classical, and also for audio books and podcasts.

The H650 has some adjustability, and is generally comfortable to wear. While the quality of the audio is very pleasing, I have some concerns about the durability of the four foot long cord, which is very thin, and doesn’t seem to have much strain relief at the connection points. I prefer an L shaped audio connector for its durability, however these headphones have a straight pin audio jack.

A sample was provided to me for evaluation. I had never heard of Edifier prior to being contacted about them, but I have since learned that the company does produce some very good quality electronics. The H650 gets high marks for sound quality, and the colors are visually pleasing, however a little extra care may be required to insure that they last."
485,"No audiophile, but I listen to lots of music and particularly as a runner and these are an excellent choice at an excellent price. Very good product. I have never been able to find ear buds that work as well while running and the extra weight, hardly, and larger profile are not a problem for me and I train pretty hard doing different running workouts, intervals, tempos and long runs and find these work the best for me out of all the choices."
486,Very disappointed. Wanted a pair of earphones for travel that were not too expensive in case of loss but better sound than earbuds. Felt very small on my ears and uncomfortable. Also after I plugged it into the airplane armrest the end broke off when I pulled it out. Wanted to return them but I missed the window. I gave them one star for how they fold in for easy storage which is another point I was looking for.
487,"These over the ear headphones are SO comfortable, and I can’t emphasize that enough. You can listen to music, podcasts, movies, or whatever is your cup of tea for hours and they will be super comfortable without them bothering your ears. Not only are they comfortable over your ears, they are comfortable on your head too.
Obviously the sound of headphones is very important when purchasing a set. I’ll tell you these sound great. There’s no crackling of any kind, you can hear all the sounds in music very clearly, as well as bass, and other instruments within the music. They sound crystal clear in my opinion. They have two 40mm high-fidelity driver units that reproduce sound with crisp highs and deep lows. The other thing I really like is it muffles outside sounds, so you don’t hear what’s going on around you, just what’s playing in your ear through the headphones themselves.
Before I received these I didn’t actually realize how compact these folded down to. Being a blogger I travel a lot. Not only to events, but as a family we travel a lot and I work while we are away. A headphone set that’s big and bulky just isn’t easy to throw in my laptop bag, so when I received the Edifier H650 headphones and folded them down, I was SO impressed. They didn't take up much room at all!
The Edifier H650 Headphones are a product that I would most definitely recommend purchasing. These have been used daily in the past week that I have received them, whether it was my 7 year old playing on her iPad or me through my smartphone or my computer to listen to music.

*I received these products for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
488,"These are sturdy, comfortable headphones with the sound quality that you would expect in a more expensive product. The two teens who tested them for me loved the sound quality and the comfort of the heavily padded ear-pieces. They also liked the fact that there's a wire out of only one ear-piece. Much less likely to strangle your self on one cord than a double one. The plug is gold-plated and makes a good connection when you plug it into a tablet, computer, or MP3 player.

The headband is adjustable, which allows both for the differences in head sizes and for types of hair styles. The padding on the ear-pieces does a great job of noise cancellation. One of the girls has used these with her school-issued MacBook Air and was able to study even on a crowded, loud school bus. They work just as well with Android devices.

So they have a lot going for them and we didn't pick them because they're purple, but that WAS a definite plus. Now the purple color is no longer available. It's pretty in the pink and other colors, but the purple is lovely. Hope they reinstate it.

These are great headphones for teens because they offer comfort, adjustment, sturdiness, and good sound quality - all for a reasonable price. I personally wouldn't send a kid off to school with an expensive set of ear-phones. Too risky. At this price, their loss wouldn't be a tragedy from which I would never recover.

Free sample provided for review."
489,"The build quality is nice and looks OK.

However, don't expect much from audio quality.
The ear cushions are quite hard and not so comfortable.

I'm using it for several hours and they're OK, but if you're plan to use them for long time, you better choose another.

BTW - the ear pads are small for an adult.
I'll say it mostly for kids."
490,"I was shocked and amazed at what a difference these headphones make to my overall happiness: I truly look forward to exercising now
that I can hear subtle parts of music I have been listening to for years, that were inaudible using the earplugs that came with my ipod.
All I had to do was adjust these headphones ONCE to fit around my head, and not once have I even been bothered by them while I exercise.
Thank you so much for producing a product that has enriched my lifestyle. The sound quality is fantastic. Music is a major part of my life.
However, in recognition of the reviewers that said $400 headphones are so much better, I will admit that my hearing is imperfect due to years of acoustic abuse from rock and roll."
491,"Poor fit, poor sound. Better priced at $5"
492,"Really great sound for a fraction of the price! My son recently broke his headphone and has been asking for a few weeks for new ones so I was excited to try these out especially for the price! They really sound great, very crisp and clear and sound just as good if not better than other big box brands AND these fold up for easy packing or storing which to me is a plus especially since this is how my son broke his. They come in many different colors and have an expandable band for bigger or smaller heads. AUX cord is plenty long for easy hookup to your phone, radio, game system etc. They also have a leather cushion to block out any noise around you, my son couldn't hear much around him with them on so they definitely blocked out the noise around him. I got these in white & silver and they neat headphones. Definitely a good buy, for a budget seeker looking for high quality ear phones at an affordable price.

I received this item for an honest and unbiased review, and I was very grateful as they are awesome!"
493,"I got the cute orange and I love the color. I also like how lightweight they are and don't weigh down on my head like some of the bulky headphones my husband owns. They feel comfortable enough around my ears. I've had them for a couple of months and used them regularly. The plastic seems to be holding up well.

I received these complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.
I was not required to give a positive review nor was I compensated to write this. This is my honest feedback after using the product."
494,"I literally went to sleep with these on while some music was playing and i woke up and was like ""Wait, i had these on?"". I felt no clamp or unfomfort at all. The sound is good, not as good as my pc cans superlux hd668b BUT i use these edifiers to go to uni while taking the long ass busride so, for those purposes id say they sound 80% as good as the superlux i mentioned.

For the price you cant go wrong at all, these are a must pick. 25$ dude, nothing can beat it for the price"
495,I really hate earbuds...ordered these earphones for my Kindle Fire HD...they are comfortable and the sound is clear...earpieces are soft and the color is cheerful...love them
496,"These Headphones were purchased for me by my husband. At first, I was concerned because they are smaller than what I had before. I have used them only a couple of times. They are comfortable. The sound is clear. I will use them mostly for airplane travel. They are good quality also. Enjoy!"
497,"Color me impressed. I pulled these headphones out of their plastic packaging, and thought, ""Look's flimsy"". The headband has no padding. The cord is smaller than anything I've seen on a headphone before. Actually, the cord is about the width of earphone cords. However, it's much shorter and thinner than my high priced headphones. So I concluded these were overpriced, cheaply made headphones. Then I put them on, turned on some Tame Impala, and.........BAM!

Apparently they spent all their money when designing these headphones, on the drivers. Its a 40mm neodymium magnet driver, which really pushes out the sound. I'm surprised, because they sound as good as my hundred dollar headphones, which is NOT what I expected at all. As for the headphone design, these are very comfortable to wear. Since they are so light, you don't even need the padding on the head band. The cushioning around the earpiece is comfortable, reinforces the bass, as well as provides sound isolation. Add in the cool, stylish colors they come in, and you have a some excellent headphones. Also, since they're foldable earpieces, you can fold them up, stick them in your backpack pocket, without wasting a bit of space. (Try that with the big cans of expensive headphones.) So if you prefer headphones to earphones, and need something to wear while you run around with your MP3 player or smart phone, I'm sure you'll like these. I'm still knocked out by the sound. Every type of music I played on these, sounded great. The bass is deep, and precise. The midrange is full, and clear. The highs are crisp, and clean. Best of all, they're so inexpensive, you can get a bunch of colors to match your wardrobe. (or not. I got the black headphones, coz black goes with everything. Plus, they look goth.)

I was provided a free pair of headphones in exchange for a fair and honest review."
498,"Surprise. We like these so much more than we thought we would. Honestly when they arrived my teenage son was like those got no swag. But they are comfortable and have great sound. They can be folded if you need to throw them in a backpack or bag. Easily adjust to fit different sized heads.
Sample received in exchange for an honest review."
499,"Music is my life. I love all types of music and listening to it for more hours than I am willing to admit. The thing is being hearing impaired, and liking to fall asleep commonly with headphones on means a picky consumer looking for something specific which means high standards.

Comfort is a big deal to me, There is no padding at the top of these headphones and the ear pads are thin and appear to rub. The outer rim is made out of thin cheap plastic, so although it is colored it is not a rich deep quality color. The cord is probably the only decent part of this product, but it is a standard type of cord many headphones of this type seem to use.

The sound is not crystal clear or loud. For someone that is hearing impaired, on the loudest volume I could not hear what other headphones could do at half volume. Again, since I am hearing impaired my perspective of sound and volume might not be similar as the average population.

I received this for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I test and scrutinize products I review to the best of my ability, in order to help you make an informed decision. My loyalty is to fellow buyers above all, so I post reviews for all products received for free or at a discount, even if they are less than positive. If anything should change in my opinion of the product, I will update it so that you have the most up to date information. Please feel free to ask any questions."
500,"I received this product for free to offer an unbiased review.
these headphones are great
they are comfy
sound quality is pretty good
great for a kid"
501,"This product is what it is a cheap headphone. It was very tight and felt like a head clamp, but after extreme stretching it is a little more bearable. The round ear pads are small for any adult and become uncomfortable very quickly. As far as sound quality, again it is what it is an inexpensive headphone. Might be great for kids, but not anyone expecting a quality headphone. You get what you pay for here"
502,"I bought this for my husband. His comments are: Good sound, very comfortable. Used them the day after received at the gym and am very pleased. No slipping while on the elliptical or treadmill. Excellent headphones for the very reasonable price. Happy to recommend."
503,"I do not own these, but have listened closely on a friend s pair. There are a number of reviews that are essentially paid for by receipt of product free. Many of these also have many people saying the review was helpful. I find that suspicious. I listen to a lot of music, all kinds, on a wide array of equipment. This includes phones from a couple thousand to earbuds. Before you clnk down some change, listen to a $250 or of phones, then compare several brands in this products price range. Tastes vary, but I think you'll see that these reviews are nothing more than advertising hype. Also, they don't give any specs. Do a comparison with similarly priced products. Taking these steps will give you a more valid eval than the paid for with product reviews. Shame on Amazon for letting this crap go on."
504,I ordered these for my Nephew who is away at college. These will be Great to help with noise in the dorm. He said they are Perfect!
505,"They do not completely block airplane sounds, but for the price, they do great job."
506,"I bought this headphones for my son and he absolutely loves them. They are perfect for him. Super light but also durable. The colors are very bright, just like the photo. I know the sound works because I have to tell him to turn the volume down because even I can hear through them! Great product!

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review, however the discount did not influence my review."
507,"CHEAP product! Ordered these for my daughter for Christmas. Well, today is Jan. 2 and maybe she has used them half a dozen times and one of the ear pieces quit working. I didn't hear back from the seller but Amazon offered to refund me the cost if I ordered another one. I begrudgingly did but also got the two year protection. We'll see what happens."
508,"Sounds quality is pretty good, seems like they will work for just listening to videos and news at the computer for my grandpa. Noise cancelling feature isn't very noise cancelling probably do to the small earcup size but overall for 20 bucks not bad"
509,These headphones are the best I have ever used. They are very comfortable and light. I took the time to wear them for almost 8 hours and I was very pleased with the way fit and performed. I am very sensitive to anything in or on my ears. I am highly satisfied. Thank You!
510,"I am most pleased with these headphones. I have a small head but they adjust to fit me quite well. The sound is remarkable and they do block out other sounds very well! These also fold up. I would buy these again if I needed another pair, I truly love listening to my books on these headphones!"
511,My 9 year old daughter loves these - she says that they fit her perfectly and don't move at all!
512,Just used these for the first time on a long haul flight. Quality so far is great for a value positioned product. Overall experience from order to use has been fantastic.
513,I'm. It sure how they are since they were a gift and sent directly to the person. No gift options were available to choose when ordering.
514,"Small, light weight, comfortable with very good sound. These headphones are a great buy."
515,"I purcahsed these for my nephew he loves his music and sports He love showing off his socks on the field or court, this was a perfect gift."
516,"Great Headphones, lightweight and very clear! Love the sound and can barely tell I am even wearing them as they are so light!"
517,They work great.
518,like the compact size and comfort
519,As expected
520,"Fantastic. For the past 5 years , I have been searching for the make up miracle to hide the dark deep circles under my eyes. It works perfectly and only takes a pin size drop to cover."
