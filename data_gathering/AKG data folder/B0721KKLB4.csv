    ","Connects beautifully, syncs sound flawlessly, sounds good, folds and travels really well.Two big issues: 1) the power switch is right next to and is the exact same shape and feel as the ""next/previous"" switch; this is frequent disaster. 2) does hurt the ears after wearing for long periods, because of the squish/clamp nature of them. Feels fine enough at first, however that pressure is certainly felt later.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Connects beautifully, syncs sound flawlessly"

    ","They're great. Sound good, Bluetooth connects flawlessly. I like the low profile design.Sound cancelation not as good as my old Boss QC15s, but good enough.Wish there was an auto power off feature. Also, as a bald guy, I wish the top band had more padding. On long flights I get a sore indent on the top of my melon.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phones!

    ","I listen primarily to music with a strong vocal component: early and traditional music, contemporary folk, modern vocal compositions etc. For such music, these headphones perform exceptionally well. I can't speak to bass reproduction, as the music I listen to is generally strongest in the higher registers, except to say that it seems more than adequate. I ran some bench-marking tests, which the headphones passed with flying colors. Soundstaging seems pretty effective to my ears; however, I can claim no great sophistication as an audiophile.As I use these for traveling, the fact that they fold down compactly and are relatively light is a big plus. Bluetooth pairing is extremely straightforward and unusually well executed compared to many devices I have used. Use with the supplied cable is easy and the sound quality equally excellent (or possibly slightly better). I have not experience any discomfort from the ear pads, with up to a couple of hours of continuous listening. The noise canceling is terrific, and a delight as I do much of my listening on long rides on the bus (I'm a long-distance commuter).I can't speak to long-term durability, but these seem very well built, and the included soft pouch is very handy. All in all, I'm delighted. The only negatives are the placing of the volume and pairing switches on the right-hand speaker, which can get confusing, and the fact that they are a little loose on my head.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphone for travel, with excellent sound quality"
3,"on March 5, 2018",,Just awesome headset. I already got a Bose Quite Comfort 35 II ... that was comfortable for sure. But this guy has lot better sound quality than Bose. Try it you will forget Bose. Product has superb noise cancellation too. Only issue is it is on ear so ear gets hot on long time play. AKG should make one over ear product with same quality with Siri connectivity for iOS devices.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just awesome headset. I already got a Bose Quite Comfort ...

    ","Excellent on ear cans, natural sound superior to Bose at the mild not quiet as good NC but still quite amazing. Long battery life. Whether listening to a book on tape in the country or bluegrass on an airplane these hold well  great construction and quality. Perhaps the only suggestion is a more protective  case.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy them

    ","I love AKG in general but these headphones are a disappointment.- NC is barely working.- uncomfortable on my ears- load his when turned on- constant beep in the background, probably high frequency but I have good hearing and it makes me headachesProExcellent music quality when turning loud so it covers hissing",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed compared to other AKG products

    ","Bought these to replace my old (7 yr old) Bose headphones....the Bluetooth pairs with no issues to my iPhone and iPad....they package way smaller than the Bose, the battery is built in and charge through a mini USB (included).  Also has a headphone cable with mic if needed...The noise cancelling is outstanding...I thought Bose had the edge until I put these on !The audio is also far superior....wish I'd bought them a year ago now üëçüòé. One happy customer...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Way superior to the Bose they're placing.

    ","As an experienced headphone enthusiast and a fan of AKG, I decided to pull the trigger on a pair of N60NC Wireless headphones. I went into this purchase not knowing what to expect, as there are no detailed reviews of these here on Amazon right now, or anywhere else for that matter.Despite the beautiful design, great build materials, light weight, fantastic portability and decent NC, these headphones receive only two stars because they fail where it matters most - sound quality.I do not consider myself to be a bass head but I do find these to be quite lacking in the bass department. Unlike some other headphones that are generally considered to be bass light (like the Audio Technica DSR7BT) adding bass to these via EQ only made them sound muddy and distorted. The mid range, although forward, lacks in the body and resolution necessary to make vocals spirited and engaging. The highs are sharp, hot and overall very fatiguing. The sound stage of these is almost non-existent, which is a big departure from the glorious sound staging that AKG is known for. The entire range of these headphones sounds as if it comes out of a distant pigeon hold, gets bounced off of a wall, then gets projected into your ears. These are pretty terrible sounding headphones all around.This is an disappointing release from AKG that is nowhere near competitive at the $300 price point. I hate to say it but the Beats Solo 3 Wireless sound far better than these. In fact, my $32 Lasmex HB65 sound far better than these do.I recommend steering clear of these because of the vastly superior competition around this price range. Below is a list of some of the other closed back headphones I own or have owned that do better at this price range to help you understand my frame of reference.In order of my favorite to least favorite:Bang & Olufsen H7Vmoda Crossfade 2 WirelessSony MDR1000XAKG K550Audio Technica DSR7BTBeyerdynamic DT1350Sennheiser Momentum 2 WirelessBeats Solo 3 WirelessSennheiser Urbanite XLBeyerdynamic CustomLasmex HB65Denon D600AKG N60NC Wireless",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite the beautiful design, great build materials"
