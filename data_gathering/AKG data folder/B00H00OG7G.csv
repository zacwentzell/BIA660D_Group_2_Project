    ","Cans sound fine, but the AKG branded audio cable supplied to use the headphones wired was defective. Looks like there's an intermittent in the plug on one end or the other. I used a cable I got from a $30 pair of headphones to test and verified it was the cable. I was actually about to return the product until I decided to check the cable. Not worth swapping the product to get a replacement, but kind of lame to get a bad $2 cable when you buy a $300 pair of cans :(UPDATE 02/2015The left earcup now only produces static when used with Bluetooth, just sent the phones back for repair. They were used exclusively wirelessly at my desk at work. The ""AKG"" branded plastic cover on the USB charge cable also came loose, making AKG 0 for 2 on cables. As an additional comment, the plastic logo panels on the sides of the headphones are a glossy finish that shows every single fingerprint. Overall, the quality is very poor for headphones in this price range, and I would not recommend them at this price. Might be worth it at $100-$120, unless of course they die after 4 months like mine.Update 3/2015After 3 weeks, still waiting on a replacement for the return I made. AKG's outsourced Indian customer support informed me that they are closing my service request, so apparently I paid $17 for UPS Ground in order to have Harmon Kardon throw away my headphones for me. I would at this point suggest that another manufacturer not under the HK umbrella might be a better use of your money.Final Update 3/2015HK Customer Service apparently just closed my case after a month without actually sending a warranty replacement and just stopped responding to my inquiries; Summary, HK doesn't honor their warranty. Worst customer service experience I've had in 10 years, no joke.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cans sound fine, but poor product quality"
1,"on February 7, 2018",,"I bought these for my Futaba Sakura cosplay, but I also just wanted a nice Bluetooth headset too. I have no complaints. I was very concerned about all of the bad reviews about receiving a faulty one, but luckily I didn't get a bad one (ordered with Pavilion Electronics for $146 which isn't too shabby because now I see them for a whooping $266!). I saw a review that showed the earpads were very deteriorated after a year but I mean, as an avid headset user I just buy replacement pads. Also the Bluetooth pairing was extremely simple, I literally just pressed the Bluetooth button on my phone and held the Bluetooth button on the headset and it paired instantly with my Samsung Note 8. The headset and your phone or media device have a different volume gauge from each other. It wasn't hard to figure out. The volume was definitely loud enough for easy listening and even loud listening especially for a Bluetooth set. Sounds don't distort either. If you have determined you don't have a faulty set, you are either going deaf or are a professional DJ that plays in loud clubs, but you would know that you shouldn't be buying Bluetooth headsets for work anyway. It comes with a charging cord, a cord that you can plug into your headset for wired listening and a nice storage bag. No complaints. Comfortable too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!
2,"on January 17, 2018",,"Holy cow, what a set of cans. These are some nice headphones! I read some reviews where the headphones came in damaged or people had trouble with quality control issues, but not so with my pair. I’ll try to detail everything here so you can get an accurate review on a pair of headphones that actually are worth the money and that aren’t factory defunct.Sound quality: 5/5Nice full bass but not so much that it crowds the mix or that it overshadows the highs/mids. As a matter of fact I found that pretty much all the EQ was spot on. Older recordings that aren’t as bass heavy still sound pretty great; the slight bass boost on the headphones help on that front. Newer recordings sound very round, but everything has a certain presence and can be heard clearly. The cups help isolate the sound (even though these are not noise cancelling) and these headphones seem plenty loud.Build quality: 5/5They feel very sturdy and seem like they could take the years well. The pivots/folding portion of the headphones feel pretty stiff, like they’re going to hold up and not just flop about after a few months of use. The buttons have a mechanical feel to them and are well placed on the right ear cup. The padding on the ear cups are very soft and comfortable, if not a bit warm for my taste, but that’s the trade off with these headphones: have hot ears or have no sound isolation.Features: 4/5The features on these headphones are a bit lacking compared to some newer models. The track skip/ffwd/rewind buttons may not be on the headphones, but the buttons that it does have get the job done. You can answer a phone call with one button press or decline it with a long press. One thing that I found to be a bit wonky was that the headphones have a separate volume from the phone/music player. At first I was a bit concerned with the volume until I realized that the headphones themselves were not all the way up. Bluetooth range seems to be a bit above average compared to other headphones I have tried. The aux input is also a welcome feature, letting you continue listening with the included cable.Overall, this is a great set of headphones for the money, and it just goes to show that sound quality is more important than features you won’t use half of the time anyway.Hope this review helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable headphones offering great sound quality.

    ","Sounds impeccable. Bowers and Wilkins P7 Wireless sound pretty much the same. My regrets with AKG are: 1) short battery life and 2) they arrived broken. One earpiece was making a contant noise that was not natural.

    ",Sound:Very clear sharp and decent bass.  I was very skeptical of the sound quality because it uses Bluetooth but I was very impressive for a Bluetooth. These will replace my SMS audio Sync/kleer headphones.Design:These headphones are serious and mature looking. My  complaints are they don't fit my head snug. I read somewhere that you can bend the headband but I'll pass on that. There is no way to forward tracks on the headset. The volume has an obvious limit with my ipod. It's not to bad it's still not a deal breaker.If you guys want a superior sounding headphones that are BT these are it. Don't waste your money on Beats by dre.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible sound

    ","I have an unfair bias towards AKG headphones because they have always been a high end brand I've focused on, but I'm slightly disappointed. These sound great and look great (which are respectively most important), I just wish they had controls for changing tracks and activating digital assistants. The power off button is much easier to push than the pause/play button (resulting in accidentally turning it off).Doesn't get too loud, bass is a little warm, which most people prefer these days.

    ","Quite comfortable for me, well-made and very good sound quality.  Bluetooth sound quality is HIGHLY dependent upon the BT ""sender"" - find something that supports aptX codec.  I used the Creative BT-W2 with these headphones and quality was MUCH better than stock Lenovo bluetooth. Range was also much better with the BT-W2. Paired well with my S5 phone and sound quality was excellent.  I can *just* get all my ear inside the cushion which makes them much more comfortable; my ear size is pretty ""normal"".  These are not a $300 pair of headphones as I think they originally went for, but they're decent for $180.  Not studio-quality, but no BT headphones right now will be - this is a limitation of bluetooth and not necessarily the headphones.  Corded quality IS better, IF you have a high-quality input, but still not a $300 pair of headphones. I also like how they fold relatively flat (like DJ headphones) for throwing in a laptop case. Contrary to other reviews, shutting them off is a matter of hitting the round button on them (controls power/pairing).One odd thing I ran into is I couldn't charge these with a li-ion battery pack... autosensing either in the headphones or the battery caused it to shut off.Pros: corded option (cord included) when battery dies or with a non-BT device, headband adjustment stays put, quit comfortable, very good sound isolationCons: can't charge while using BT (but can still use cord), power/pair button is easy to accidentally hit when reaching for volume controlsFailed a 5-star, because while they're very good, I just don't feel they are *excellent*.  Charging while using BT, <$150 price point, skip controls, better battery life would probably make them 5-start cans.  Still I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good - just not quite *excellent*

    ","Good BT headphones. I can listen them without noticing much difference to my HD650. Noise isolation is quite good. They are over the ear but not mach, so if wearing beanie these will become on-the-ear. Good buy for $200 as I got it, not sure about $300.Something that I would note:- blue led is always blinking when headphones are enabled, can be quite distracting while listening in darkness;- sound can be interrupted when listening in a place with a lot of WiFi networks. Still works fine when laptop on laps, may work not so good when laptop is on stand behind display, In non-congested places no problems.

    ",Wow. I had tried many other high end BT headphones and these blow them away. The sound quality is incredible. Easily rivaling wired headphones in this price range.They seem to be of very good build quality and are very comfortable.You will not be disappointed.UPDATE: After all I ended up returning these and instead I bought the Sony MDR-1RBT. There were 2 main reasons I like the Sony's better. 1. The Sony's have a 30 hour battery life while AKG has a comparative measly 8 hours. 2. They are much more comfortable and fit completely over my ear. I have pretty standard size ears for a man and the AKG's bottom pad rests on my earlobe. The Sony's sound great but I think AKG  is just a bit better. The sound quality difference is so not noticeable to me that I don't see it as a consideration. The Sony's also have a forward/back button which the AKG's do not have. The Sony's have better noise isolation and leak much less as well. The Sony's come with a carrying case while the AKG's do not. The price of the MDR-1RBT-s as of this review is about $270 which is the cheaper of the 2 as well.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best high end bluetooth headphones

I have own many bluetooth headphones including the Jabra Revo, Plantronics BackBeat Pro, Voxoa, and Velodyne vFree in the past and the AKG K845BT sound signature is the best out of all of them.  I wanted so much to keep these, but a few drawbacks with the AKG K845BT forcing me to send it back.Drawbacks:1.  The bluetooth range is very flaky and not as stable as the Plantronics BackBeat Pro2.  There is no skipping forward/backward on song tracks3.  Not foldable making carrying case choice very limited4.  Doesn't come with a carrying case (at $300 with no carrying case?

    ","Seriously, they only way to turn these headphones off is to turn off Bluetooth on your device and let them time out. The buttons are stubby, awkward to use and lack the versatility of a Bluetooth device of this generation. My final complaint is the bass is lacking, I tested this both wired and wireless. Over all the clarity and range of the headphones is excellent if a little quiet. I'm not sure if the European Union forces AKG to limit the max volume output of these headphones but I would love to see what they can really do as it seams low for the size of the drivers. Though when I had them maxed out there was zero distortion. Anyway, it's loud enough to get the job done for commuting or flying but don't expect to DJ with them.The materials they are made out of are awesome, they are light weight, the sizing band works well and holds properly and the ear cups are comfortable and fit perfectly over my ears. There is little or no sound bleed so you can wear them wherever without disturbing those around you. The battery seems to last forever, I have used them so long on one charge that both my phone and my tablet ran out of power before they did.

    ","These headphones sound amazing (when using the cord), exactly what you would expect from an AKG with 50mm drivers. However there are three big issues with these:1. When using bluetooth and paired with a mac, there is static (hisses and pops) added to the audio. It is very distracting from the music, and makes the bluetooth almost unusable. Also, the headphones claim to be able to be used as a headset with microphone (they offer up a headset bluetooth profile), however the don't actually work as a mic.2. The paint finish wears off very easily.3. The headphones don't hold a charge well - if fully charged, they will be dead after 1-2 days even if they are off.Based on these issues, you are probably better off ditching the bluetooth functionality and using the K545 (same size) or the K550 / K551 (larger size, slightly better sound).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth doesn't work well with Mac

    ","After reading up on reviews made by head-fi.org and many others I decided to go with the K845BT. Unfortunately straight out of the box I discover that the left ear cup gives away a weird noise, turn on the music and there is no sound coming from the left side either.I go back in and read some of the others ratings and soon realize Im far from the only one having this issue. I work on a cruise ship and my options on how to return the item is very limited. Im so F***ING pissed off because not a singel review ever mentioned this issue and after paying close to 300$ for a pair of headphones you expecting to have to deal with this s***.I advice anyone who considering buying a pair of those to turn back around and look for something else... save your self the trouble!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ear cup doesn't work, 50/50% chance that you get a working pair."

    ","I felt compelled to write this review because there is some misinformation in other reviews. I will try to be as objective as I can when necessary and try to be clear about when I am speaking subjectively.SOUNDI'll start here because most people seem to be agreeing that the sound is great. It does indeed have good clarity for a portable headphone, and the sound does improve slightly via auxiliary cable. I don't believe ""perfect"" sound is necessary with a portable headphones that I plan to use while out and about. I expect outside noise to leak in, I expect to be distracted, I expect the environment will not be ideal. Brilliant sound is for a controlled, quiet environment where you can listed to the subtle details of music (or films) and appreciate them. With that being said, I will reiterate that these AKG's are quite nice to listen to.Some people have mentioned the headphones are not loud. At max volume, they are not ripping my ears off, but they are plenty loud to me. In fact, I never have them on max volume. The volume up/down button on the headphones are separate from your devices volume. In other words, if you change the volume on the AKG's, you will not see the volume level bar on your device change. It is independently a headphones volume. My usually listening is device on max volume, and I control the headphone volume. Hence I have it usually around mid-level at most. Low level if it's quiet environment. Very rarely I have it at high if it's a particularly noisy environment. Just for reference, I have been to way too many shows without earplugs. I know my ears are not as sparkly perfect as they once were.FUNCTIONSHere is where I think there needs some clearing up. The instructions that came with the headphones are poor. The bluetooth is version 3.0. It's not a problem as far as I know even though 4.0 is available. It can only pair with one device at a time. There is a button on the bottom of the right earcup that turns bluetooth ON and OFF. It's a very ideal position for my right thumb. As I put them on, my thumb can hit the button to turn on, as I take them off, I can hit it again to turn BT off. Simple. There is a tone that is different for on and off you will hear. Also a blue light next to the button that blinks relatively slowly when turning on (it pairs with the last device it was paired with), and it will blink rapidly about 3 times when turning off.How to change devices: hold the bluetooth button for a couple seconds and the blue light will start blinking slowly again, it is now searching, so go to your device that you want to pair and find it and pair. While bluetooth is on and paired, the blue light will blink once every 5 seconds or so. I thought this would be distracting while on my head, but it's not. I can't see it at all. The nice thing is, if I take them off, because it continues to blink once every 5 or so seconds, I know it's still on.I've paired it with iPhones, Chromebooks, Macbook Pros, and so on. No problems, hisses, pops, whatever else others say. I have no idea why that would happen. Bluetooth is proprietary technology, it's the same in every device except for the version. If there are problems with a single device, I would look into the devices bluetooth hardware/software to see if there are issues. I've also never had a problem with the pairing dropping off.There is no forward and back buttons as many have mentioned. There is a pause/unpause, volume up, volume down. I never skip songs or podcasts. I just hit play and go on about my day. If I need to change what I'm listening to, I'm usually looking for something specific anyway, so I go to my device. For people who like shuffle play and have short attention spans for music, I can see how a forward/back button would be great. In that case, these headphones are lacking.There is a microphone on the bottom/front of the right ear cup. If you are looking at the headphones from the right side, so the right ear cup is facing directly at you, the mic is around the 4 or 5 o'clock position so it is closer to your mouth. It works just like any other headset for your mobile phone. I believe the clarity when speaking is not the best because I tend to get people saying ""what?"" more often than speaking normally on my phone or using a purpose built hands-free headset. I don't know if that has to do with the quality of the mic or the position or both. It works ok though for the most part.BATTERIESMy experience with the batteries have been great. I've had these headphones for 4 months now. When I got them initially, they had charge in them, I have no idea how much, but I went ahead and charged them up to full. I have in that time only needed to charge it once. When the batteries are low, a red light will blink to warn you and you will hear a tone. I use them almost daily, sometimes a lot, sometimes not much. I try to be good about turning off BT when I'm not using them (see FUNCTIONS section above about how easy it is to do this). Sometimes I forget to turn BT off and I find them still on at the end of the day. Oh well. I've only charged them once in 4 months. I cannot say you will get this battery life if you make heavy use of BT listening on a daily basis. Maybe you will have to charge it every day or every other day. I don't know. I can only tell you my experience.COMFORTThese AKG's lack most in comfort for me. It's their biggest downfall. At this price point, I expect my headphones to be very comfortable. The cups are round as you probably noticed from the pictures. This means that if your ears are a little bigger they will not be completely inside. Ears tend to be bigger up and down, not side to side. So oval shaped ear cups will accommodate a greater variety of physiques like the Bose or Beats headphones for example. The actual driver inside the cup is not at an angle the way Bose and other headphones are. For large reference headphones with thick padding, this can be ok, but the padding on the cups of these AKG's is not super thick, so the back of my ears are pressed against the inside. If you haven't figure it out, my ears are too big for these. I wouldn't say I have huge ears (like another reviewer noted) but probably above average size.The padding, although not super thick as mentioned, would be sufficient if the shape of the cups were oval. They are portable headphones, so I am not expecting the huge padding like reference headphones. Also the padding on the top band feels nice and squishy to the touch, but is not sufficient over long periods of time. My guess is this can generally be a problem for many headphones. I've heard Beats are pretty great in comfort though. The band adjustment is great. There are numbers so you can remember where is most ideal for you if it ever is moved. The cups turn to be flat, and they also turn slightly more than perfectly sideways to mimic the angle of your ears. But this isn't an equal replacement for having the drivers at an angle inside the cup because the cup padding now doesn't sit flat against your head behind your ear.To be clear about this comfort section, I am being quite picky because of the price point. They are probably more comfortable than many other headphones generally. I don't entirely notice the discomfort now because I am used to it, but I really shouldn't at all. I will also add they seem pretty light. I don't feel like there is a brick on my head.ROUNDUPSound:Probably about a 7/10 compared to high end reference headphones if those will generally be around 9-10 range relative to all headphones.For portables I could say these are 9-10/10 given I'm never really listening in an ideal environment anyway.Function:9/10 For simplicity. Lacks forward/back and pairing with multiple devices at the same time. Microphone position or quality can be improved for telephone usage.Comfort:7/10 generally speaking4/10 for this price point.I hope this helps!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, stylish, simple to use but with some drawbacks"

    ","I got to try these out, and they are great! I had NONE of the issues others are mentioning here. They have that ""wide magical"" AKG sound signature that NO other company at this point offers for BT, were pretty comfortable, look nice, and were easy to use too. BT sounded great, but of course using the wired option meant slightly more clarity & volume.Note: These are over-ear headphones, NOT on-ear.Very highly recommended!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,FANTASTIC Headphones!

    ","Simply put if you like the original AKG K550 headphones or the new K545's these basically slide write into the niche between them. The sound quality is exceptional for a Bluetooth headphone. I dont know how AKG and Harmon pulled it off but their honestly is know difference in the sound from the K545's and these. I've owned the K550's for about two years and my fiancé has pretty much claimed them as hers now, so I was looking to upgrade to one the newer K545 or K551 models when these where realesed 2 months ago. I knew I would be traveling in the upcoming months and I had been looking for a Bluetooth headphone exp.(Parrot Zik and Sony MDR BT) when I decided to try out the new K845 BT 's and to my surprise the sound quality from these blows both of those models away. With the fit, finish and build quality basically the same as the K550's and with the added options of being able to attach a cord if the battery gets low, I was sold. Im usually not a white headphone guy but the matte iceberg white and grey metal) accents look absolutely sick and so far they are my best purchase of 2014. np",5.0 out of 5 stars,Currently one the best Bluetooth headphones out right now.

    ","Plain and simple comparable to the Sony MDR-1RBT and Parrot Zik wireless bluetooth headphones the sound quality of the AKG K845BT's blows them away. The Logitec UE9000 would be the only current wireless bluetooth headphones that are equal to the sound quality of the K845's. Both headphones sound equal to their brands wired counter part. If you know the history of AKG's headphone line these fall right in place between the K550's, K551's and the new K545's which are basically the wired version of this model. I highly recommend theses headphones if you get a chance to check them out in the Bestbuy Magnolia store you will pleasantly surprised.  The only flaw which is not a major one sincecthe headphones stay charged for a good 9-10 hours on continued use. Is that their is not an active off switch once the headphones are fully charged.  However once you unpair them from your device or plug in one of the Android or Apple included wires the Bluetooth functions do finally cut off. But to me that is a small price to pay to have a bluetooth headphone that sounds better than most of the wired headphones in its price range plus you can use them wired as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best Bluetooth headphone available right now.  The sound quality is impeccable, they still have that AKG sound."

    ","10.21.2016I ordered this again after I lost it because I loved it.When I got it and tried to listen music, I could hear buzzing noise.I don't remember there is noise before(probably not) so, I returned it and ordered it again.However, this one had same noise. I tried to listen other songs, but the result was same.I had to return and orderd it again. I really hope to not hear noises again... But.. this also has buzzing noise.Even the last one seems not new one. The box case's tape was opened.It makes me crazy. I got stress because of it.But I am not going to give up. I'm going to return and order it one more time.I hope to get a certain new one that doesn't have buzzing noise at this time.10.23.2016I ordered two more this headphone and I will return it again because these have same noise problem and uneven shape on both sides sponges.Also, some finger print on them too, so I doubt whether those are new.Now, I am getting tired to get the headphone doesn't have noise problem as I got before.",2.0 out of 5 stars,NOISE problem again and again.

    ","I have to go with the ""I don't like it"" star rating for these. I've had them for 6 months now. The red light remains on forever. The bluetooth won't connect to my laptop anymore (it used to). They don't connect to the PS4 (never did but harman support said something about ""future update on the way""). The battery life is really short, or maybe mine are just lemons. When I was using them I usually ended up completely wired with cords coming from both ears, the power cable and the 3.5mm.GOOD:Every review raves about how good these are so there's not much more to say. The build quality is my favorite part.BAD:Bluetooth only connects to my iPhone 5 and nothing else anymore.The battery life sucks.There's no reset button.There's no software to tweak or help troubleshoot.The band over the top can be uncomfortable.For this price I expect more. If I'd stayed with a wired headset I'd be happier.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth stopped working. Battery life is poor. Great materials.

    ","These are a great set of headphones for use at work. I found them very comfortable, I can code all day with these on. Sound is excellent, and works really well with a mobile phone (as you'd expect). I actually preferred the sound quality when using Bluetooth rather than the cable. Battery life is awesome - lasting we about a week of daily use at work. No sound leakage at all. You won't bother anyone with these.BUT - The Bluetooth decoding died in one side of the headphones after about the 3rd recharge.  I am about to return mine and get a set of Sennheiser Momentum 2 Bluetooth headphones as my supplier (not Amazon) couldn't get me another set. It's probably just a bad set, but I thought people should know. I got mine for £150, so they were a bit of a bargain.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant as long as they don't go wrong.

    ","Purchased my AKG845's(in white) a few weeks ago and now that they are broken in, I want to say how great they are. Especially when you consider they are wireless and sound every bit as the best wired headphones I've tried.The Sound,Overall well balanced headphones that despite being closed back, seem quite airy. They have a slightly accented, tight bass. The mids are, as with most AKG products, smooth and expressive. The highs are very clean and crisp. These are a very well rounded set of cans that have studio quality sound which are perfect for home use and yet, are  just small enough to travel well.The Tech.The Bluetooth pairs very well with my both my Blackberry Z10 and Playbook. As well, these paired easily with a freinds I-phone and my Nolan home stereo/BT adaptor. All the on-the-ear controls worked with each device. I am getting between 8 - 10 hours of battery life from a 2 hour full charge.There is not much to dislike about these and I highly reccomend the AKG K845BT.In reading some of the other reviews, I have to say that this... There is an off switch(it's the bluetooth button). These are one of the most comfortable cans I have ever worn. Sony MDR-1RBT's don't even come close to the sound quality of these. The paint has not worn off on mine(and I wear mine all the time and often take them on business trips) nor 3 of my buddies who also own them.Art",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice Bluetooth cans
