    ","These headphones are not good. They are GREAT and have pushed the envelope on my expectations on what a I set of headphones in the price range should cost. I don't make such statements flippantly, as I own about 12 different headphones many of which were purchased from Amazon. The two most endearing qualities of this pair are as follows:1. The sound quality to my ears is nearly flawless. Now, that is a subjective judgment. But when I listen to my favorite music and I fully get into it and forget it I'm wearing headphones, that is a good sign because I am very critical when it comes to how music comes across through speakers, and headphones. Out of all the headphones that I have owned over the years, there has been only one that has been my ""Go-tos""and that is the Plantronics Backbeat Pro. Plantronics is known primarily for its headsets used for call centers. But they also make some of the best headphones which many authoritative sources rank to be among the best, and I'm with them. Now these from IdeaUSA will also be the ones that I reach for.What is it that I like about the sound so much? Well, it is full, and it sounds alive. At the same time they avoid the tendency to bottom load on the bass just because people like bass. Rather, these are well-balanced and they disappear when you're listening. It's just you and the music.2. The noise cancellation is in same league as both my Plantronics and my Bose headphones. When I push around the vacuum cleaner and I turn these on, I do not hear the sound from the vacuum cleaner. I don't mean that literally, because the hum is still there just as it is with any high-end set of headphones. But, what I mean is that whatever noise does slip through, does not dilute the music or, for that matter audible books which I listen to a lot these days. And that is something that up until the past week that I could only say about my Plantronics headset.If you are the type of person that doesn't go by brand-name, but rather are fully judging headphones by the sound, you want to grab these and give them a try. Go ahead and compare them to The overrated and overpriced brands that are out there. That's not to say that there are not some really incredible headphones that you can pay over 500 bucks for. I'm just saying forget about price. Forget about the fact that you may have never heard of idea USA before, and just try them and see what you think.A few other things to consider:-These headphones have your cups that can be turned in such a way that the set becomes a flatter profile. So it easily fits into the included zippered hard case.-The controls on the ""cans"" give you more than left tactile sensation that it becomes very easy to pause, play, increase or decrease the the volume, advance to the next song, go back to the previous song.-These are very intuitive and I was able to charge them up and begin using them right away Without reading any Instructions. In fact I don't even know where they are.Is there anything I don't like about this? Well one feature I would love to see is a way in which they allow you to turn on an external microphone so that you can clearly hear what's going on in the outside world. If you have the noise canceling turned on, you won't hear much other than your music. If you turn off the noise cancellation the seal surrounding the two earpieces is sufficient to still block out most of the outside noise. Consequently, if you want to hear something you have to take the headphones off your ears.That is a pretty minor complaint.So if you're looking for Headphones that are audiophile quality for a price that is on the low end when compared to other headphones that cost a lot more, I strongly recommend that you give these a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I think you will like these

    ","I’d consider these V200 as on-ear headphones, resting on top of the earlobe rather than going over. The older, V203 headphones by iDeaUSA were over-the-ear style. Both have a similar build, in fact, the headbands are nearly identical in size, quality and materials used. The padding is the same too. Included in similarities is the metal slider that has a sturdy hinge for rotating the ear cups.As mentioned, the ear cups got smaller. As a result, they also got lighter. I weighed the V200 in at 335 grams whereas the V203 was at 345 grams. For comparison, an unopened can of soda is around 385 grams, so both are lighter than that. iDeaUSA also has the V201 that weighs even less at 213 grams. As for myself, I prefer the more sturdy and solid metal body over the plastic; I like the durability and quality feel. Not only that but, because the headband is well padded, they don’t feel uncomfortable or too heavy. I’ve worn them for hours straight without any discomfort.They felt comfortable when wearing with eyeglasses too. Some headphones I've owned end up pushing against the temples, which cause pinching against my ears. The ear cup padding on the V200 is soft enough to prevent added pressure, but still firm enough to stay well in place. In fact, I couldn't feel any difference between wearing the headphones with or without eyeglasses.The noise canceling works well; I was able to listen to music with the vacuum running, and didn’t even hear the motor. That is, as long as music was playing. I did notice that my ears got hot when I was moving around; the ear cups block sound but also trap in heat. They work great when sitting at a desk or doing work in the kitchen, but I’d avoid tasks that increase your heart rate for too long. That is, unless you don’t mind sweat building up. The headband also slides forward a bit when bending down, such as in a bowed position. Which means some chores might cause a problem. Overall, I find that these are best for sitting back and relaxing – or going on leisurely walks.As to the sound quality, I’d say the V200 have more bass but slightly less treble than the older V203. Great for music, movies and video games. That said, you get better treble with the noise canceling turned off, just as you get more bass with it turned on. Overall, I think the sound quality is quite good.With both models (new and old), there’s a male voice that speaks the current state, such as, “pairing, device disconnected, power on, power off, etc.” While I don’t see a way of turning that off, I do find the audio prompts helpful when the headphones are on my head. That way I can hear what’s going on while pressing the button rather than having to watch the indicator light.When taking these out of the box for the first time, I noticed a slight odor coming from the ear cups. My guess was that it was due to some sort of epoxy from the manufacturing process. When contacting the manufacturer, I was told the smells were actually caused from the protective case. Apparently, the factory changed the material used so that new models don’t have this problem. For buyers like me who received one of the early products, I found that the odors go away when leaving the headset and case in a breezy windowsill for a day or so.The carrying / storage case they come in is much nicer than the bag the old V203 came in. It has a hard shell and zips closed with enough room to store your extra cables. There is also a loop that fits fully around your wrist that makes for easy carrying.An included 3.5mm audio cable lets you connect to a non-Bluetooth device. However, keep in mind that there is no prong for the microphone. The mic only works when connected to Bluetooth.Overall, I find that iDeaUSA typically produces good quality products at a reasonable price. These V200 are no exception. They are lighter than their older counterpart, look sharper, have a better carrying case, and offer more bass.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good bass and noise canceling, comfortable"

    ","These headphones did meet my expectations. The noise cancelling worked well, cutting out droning, repetitive noises like fans, lawn mowers, and aircraft engines. Some people think noise cancelling is suppose to cut out all noise. Not true; you can still hear non-repetitive noises (and higher frequency noises) like someone talking to you in the same room i.e. if the music is not playing too loud. The Bluetooth pairs up every time to my Android phone and Kindle Fire. The 30 foot range is about right. I like the voice prompts. The bass response is good without being overwhelming. The mid and high ranges are not as ""crisp"" as top headphones like the Bose QuietComfort 25, but still satisfactory for this price range. Turning on the noise cancellation seems to give the music a midrange ""boost"" which then emphasizes the voices more. This isn't ""bad"" per se, if you like that equalization setting. I also like the construction. They seem sturdy with the adjustable metal bands, not plastic. I had to throw away my other pair of wireless headphones because the plastic broke at the joint between the headband and the earpiece. They are comfortable (on my average size head at least), I'd say just about the right amount of tension.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"repetitive noises like fans, lawn mowers"

    ","I've had these headphones for about 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with them so far.  I used them on a 5 hour flight recently and they definitely met my expectations; very comfortable to wear and very decent sound quality.  I'm sure if you compare these to the Bose version, you would notice a comparable difference.  For the price difference though, you will be very happy with these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for this price range!

    ","These appear to be very well built. Nice weight but not too heavy. Very comfortable ear pads. Easy to use controls. Will give them the first real test in 2 weeks when on a 5 hour flight to Seattle. So far, I have used them in the office and it is very interesting. Put them on, and just turn the noise canceling on, and was amazed at how much ambient noise is in the office. AC fans, lights humming. All gone with the flick of a switch. Listening to music, I don't hear any distractions, even if someone walks up behind me. Now, it remains to be seen how well they work in an airplane environment.In the office, I can't really crank the volume, so I can not tell  how well they operate in a noisy cabin like a plane, but will update after my trip. They will get loud, but not ear splitting loud. That is probably good unless you are a metal head and like sheer volume.Overall, for the price, they can't be beat, IMHO. Everyone who I have let test them out, has asked how much?  When I tell them, they vow they are going to order a pair. I work with a lot of people who travel for business for work, so they can appreciate the product.Just remember to make sure the noise cancel is turned off when you put them away. It will drain the battery sitting idle.Update: 5 hour flight to Seattle and back. No need to recharge. Worked excellent in the airplane. Does not kill outside noise and sound totally, but it is effective. This is the one to buy. Forget the Bose brand and their high price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice weight but not too heavy

    ","LOVE these headphones! They sounded wonderful on my Lumia 735 and now they sound just as good on my Galaxy J7 V. I actually bought a Bluetooth USB dongle so I can listen through my desktop computer and laptop. My ONLY complaint is, as others have said, the noise cancelling feature doesn't turn off when you turn off the headset, so it will drain the battery if left on. But, putting it in the case after each use forces me to angle my phone ear cups and I always see the green light is on so I never forget to turn it off. I must say that they sound pretty good w/out noise cancelling turned on but everything sounds wonderful with it turned on... more bass, more mid-range... just has a beautiful sound, so I always use that feature. $99 for something built so well and connects easily? Oh yes!! Other headphones I've used have had problems showing up and pairing, taking up to 15 minutes to get the job done. This literally connects in seconds, as it should. A+++, very happy, and thank you!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just YES! A+++
6,"on March 25, 2018",,"These are version well constructed. Due to neurological and vision issues, I no longer read books. But I still love books. With headsets like this I can listen to books hour after hour. Three head band is passed and well constructed. That's important to me, since my head size is larger than normal. I wear a 7 7/8"" hat .. large enough that even one size fits all hats don't fit. But these headphones remain comfortable for me. The ear cups for comfortable on ears. The passing is exceptional. They passively reduce outside sounds. The audio reproduction is good. It is certainly good enough for speech.Music also sounds clear and crisp on these headphones. I remember thinking ""I don't remember that sound ok that album!"" with more than one album.The active nose cancellation is pretty good. It only eliminates low frequency sounds. It reduces, but doesn't eliminates mid and upper frequency sounds. In fact it seems to ""brighten"" mid range sounds. In particular, exterior speech sounds clearer with these headphones.The microphone does a pretty good job picking up my voice. It's perhaps not the best, but it's not bad.The headphones such well and easily with my phone. It's not the very latest Bluetooth standard. But it's not out of date.The battery is pretty exceptional. A couple hours chargers the headphone fully. They then last for 12 to 18 hours of continual use. Use of active nose cancellation decreases that time. But not dramatically.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent choice at an excellent price.
7,"on March 27, 2018",,"I Initially had some difficulty with pairing the headset with my PC (2017 Win10Pro v1709).  The pairing defaulted to the V200 Hands free driver which is mono and oriented to speech (1 channel, 16 bit, 16kHz).  After some adjustments I discovered there is another driver ""V200 Stereo"" which delivers the standard CD quality sound (i.e. 2 channel, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz) I expected . This drivers delivers the high quality audio I was expecting of this headset. I have not tested the headset using the supplied 3.5 mm audio cable. Sound quality is good for this type of unit.  The sound level (and balance) changes when you switch on the noise cancelling. With the Noise Cancelling on, the sound is a bit warmer and louder with more reverb.  Sound placement and distortion levels are actually quite good.My only complaint is that the driver does not allow for listening to very high quality sound sources (e.g. 24 bit 48 kHz audio).  Just a quibble since I would not expect headsets in this price range to support that level of quality.I have not tested the microphone for speech quality (there is no boom microphone.)  The mic is located in the right headset exterior cup. and really is not ideal for lengthly conversations.I have had the headset for 2 weeks and am satisfied with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Bluetooth Sound for less than $100

    ","They work fairly well - I am very pleased with them as headphones/bluetooth headphones, but less impressed by the NC function.They come with a nice case that has kept them safe on numerous trips and seem fairly robust generally.I have only worn them for about 2 hours at a given time but found it to be a comfortable experience.On an airplane they reduce the engine noise and ambient noise, but it's not amazing.  Definitely better than mere noise isolating earphones, but don't expect the same NC functionality as the expensive name brand competitors.I paid $20 when there was a coupon available and I'm happy with the purchase, but if I had paid $80 I would probably be less impressed.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, decent noise cancellation"
9,"on February 10, 2018",,You can obviously spend hundreds of dollars for the high end noise cancelling headphones. And I'm sure those work really well. It's not fair to compare an $80 paid to those. This set works really well and for the money the value is tremendous. I'm not an audiophile. I primarily use these when I'm working on my laptop in a coffee shop or library for hours on end. I have several ear buds that I had been using. But after a few hours my ear buds started to get uncomfortable. These headphones are comfortable and the sound is solid.  The active noise cancelling works but it doesn't block out all sounds. It seems to do a good job blocking out lower volume constant noises like the humming of a fan or refrigerator. But it won't totally block out sharper intermittent noises like glasses clinking or someone talking on the phone. Overall they work great. The ability to plug a standard wired connection into your music source when the batteries die is also a great feature I've used a few times. The carrying case is very helpful. This is a great value for just $80.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value

    ","I bought these to work in a very noisy open office and they work great.  The noise cancelling works pretty well, especially if you have some music playing.  The sound quality is excellent, especially for this price range, and there is no scratchy background noise like some bluetooth headphones have.  I'm able to use them for most of the day even with the NC on.  Since they charge off of a USB port it's easy to recharge them if needed and you can continue to use them while they're charging.  You can also connect them via a regular 3.5mm cable if the batteries are dead and they work fine for listening.  Even without the NC on, the ear cups block background noise pretty well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones For The Office

    ",The headphones have worked well in the first week.  The active noise cancelling is decent; it blocks moderate noise from about twenty feet away.  The charge seems to last at least 8 hours with the active noise cancelling on.  I've seen comments about the headphones being heavy but they didn't seem heavy to me.  I like the way they fit over my entire ear.  There is occasional static/interference.  The headphones won't stay paired with a Vaio laptop (which may be due to an issue with my computer).

    ","Overall these headphones are some of the best in its class under $100. Great for a portable headset for commutes, travel, or daily use on the go.The controls on the side of the headphones are intuitive and easy to access. The seek and volume buttons are flush but are large enough to find/use without issue with the low-profile Bluetooth button in the center.The headset appears to have a mostly metal construction and create an industrial/modern/minimalist design. It feels sturdy and durable when handling and folding. The folding hinges and moving parts do not feel like they would break, even when I stress tested them with a reasonable amount of pressure there was no sign that the headset would break. These are a surprisingly durable pair of wireless headphones without being excessively heavy.The comfort of these headphones is also very well balanced on. The earcups are well-padded with pliable foam and a soft faux leather material. The stitching seams on the leather are subtle and well-placed to avoid pressure points. They also don't pinch the sides of your head while wearing them, but also don't feel loose.Overall, these headphones are a serious contender in their class. It is worth noting that these headphones are really best used with ANC activated, without ANC it seemed that audio quality was noticeably less enjoyable. Also, I would not rely on the ANC for louder environments, but they're perfect for some ambient noise when riding a bus/train, walking around the city, and comfortable indoor listening.The headset also has room for improvement with the low-end sound (bass) which is average and the ear cups could be a little larger. However, I'm really happy that iDeaUSA listened to feedback and gave the ear cups an ovular shape that better fits the ergonomics of ears. Very pleased with these headphones overall and the solid construction of these makes them perfect for portable listening.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Slick design, durable build quality, great features & sound."

    ","I have a set of Bohm headphones and these are better than the Bohm B76's.These are just more comfortable on my head.  The other full ear cup headphones are usually heavy and, as a glasses wearer, I find that they are uncomfortable.These ones are lighter and the ear cups are more adjustable.  You can swing the ear cup forward and have the band hold them in place.These paired easily to my PC, my phone (android) and my itouch.There was no cut out, within 15'.I was listening to the Moody Blues, Queen, Adele, Ed Sheeran, CCR, and then for the finale: Disturbed 'Sound of Silence'.The highs were clear and bright without any grating sharpness.  The deep base and background sounds were pronounced and clear.Lyrics were easily heard and in some songs, I heard background singers I never knew were there.All in all: these are wonderful headphones for the price.They come with a hardshell case, a charging cable (standard micro usb), and a plug in cable.Again: I like that these are more comfortable on my head than the Bohm's.If you need a pair of headphones for noise cancellation and listening to your favorite music, you'll love these.My husband stood behind me and couldn't hear any noise bleedthrough on them as I was listening at a medium volume (70db).Very happy with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, excellent sound, easily paired to multiple devices.

    ","I'm a really enjoying these headphones. I really love the long battery life which is really one of the main reasons for my purchase. Second reason for my purchase  was that I own the w206 wifi speaker from ideaUsa and it is absolutely incredible. I really like that I have dedicated controls to change track so to change tracks I only have to short press once. I hate headphones that not only combine the buttons to change volume and tracks but also make changing the volume the main function but operating with a short press and changing tracks the secondary function being done with a long press, now for me I change tracks much more than I change volume up a down so It would seem to make most sense by having that as the short press function. I'm pretty sure we all skip trough songs back to back sometimes and it's so time comsuming when u have to hold a buttin for 3 secs to change one track. so I am so thankful this is no issue with these headphones which is a 3rd reason why I bought yet another bluetooth headphone. So all in all I can't think of any negatives I've experienced testing these puppies out.Update 6/04/17:Back for more just to say how much I'm loving my ideaplay products I have these headphones which I really enjoy using I bought these for work cuhz the long battery life my powerbeats Ike phones don't always last all day, but come to find out they idiotically only allow buds so I can't use these v200s at work..sucks. so anyway the Anc is w.e. but I don't have an experience to compare to anyway but I do use it sometimes and there's a noticeable difference it's like it turn the outside noise into white noise, or that's my take on it. But these phones are a must buy. But even more so is the incredible w206 ideaplay wifi speaker man I love this thing there are some pitfalls but still I'm blown away by this powerful lil thing. And if u use music streaming service you'll love this speaker it controls the music from say Pandora independently without your phone or w.e. I'm gonna get another one to get the full experience. OK so the pits are the battery seriously inferior and it's just a lil heavy with no handle so this is really more of a home speaker. So I would definitely recommend if you want your house bumping with a feature full musical experience.

Better sound quality and craftsmanship than headsets 3x the price! I'll admit though, that I don't notice a difference with the noise cancellation switch in either on or off position besides the LED lighting.

Additionally, while doing a great job on enveloping you with airtight sound from the surrounding environment, the full earcups get annoyingly sweaty.

    ","THe sound is fantastic, quality construction, easy accessible and logical buttons, comes with a great storage case as well as airplane plug adapter and wired audio cabe.  My problem with them is that the noise cancelling is weak.  It adds a bit of pink-noise and a small level of reverse audio (the noise cancelling) to block out unwanted surrounding sound.  I have another big-brand and they are much more active and effective in reverse phase cancellation of ambient sound.  If I was rating the noise cancellation alone, I'd give these headphones 2-3 stars.  But I am indeed pleased with everything but the noise cancellation, which does reduce vs cancel.

106,"on April 18, 2017",,"I have been using no stop since I recieved them. I think they sound great and like them over countless ear buds. Could be a little tighter fit on head, but minor issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Personally I love them
107,"on May 6, 2017",,"I think in overall they're good headphones. The upper side needs more padding. In my opinion they're a little heavy but still comfortable for a long use. They're a little loose so they're not for any activity rather than walking. The sound is good, it may have some issues with highs but for the price the sound is really good. I find the material good, the padding in the earcups looks and feels good.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones
