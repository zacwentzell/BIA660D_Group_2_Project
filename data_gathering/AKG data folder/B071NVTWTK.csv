    ","Great pair of headphones. The noise cancelling is top notch. Not disappointed in the least with my purchase. As far as sound goes, the quality is on par with my previous pair of wired AKG N60 Mac's. Would highly recommend these pair to anyone looking for a compact set of wireless noise cancelling headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise cancelling at its best

    ","Exceeded my expectations. Brought this to try out with the intention it was gonna be some low watt headphones with no bass and just highs. Was I wrong. It punches. Has good highs that don't fall off, the mids delivers. This the best NC headphones out. The only gripe is the battery life when you first get it. After a few days it gets better. It's worth to try out. I also used viper4android to fine tune it perfectly. Good job AKG",5.0 out of 5 stars,Someone has good ears at AKG. Sub Bass lovers gonna like this.
9,"on January 2, 2018",,"Bought it on the Black Friday with very good price. I would like to say the sound is quite good.I had one over ear Sony MDR-10RNC, the NC is good but sound is quite boring, that's the reason why I chose an On-Ear.As for AKG N60NCBT, the quality is quite good. The head set bag is small but just match with the headset. Very convinent for traveling.NC is always on when the BT is connected. It works well in the noise enviornment, but I should say not as good as Over ear NC.It is perfect for female sound. But not so deep bass, so not so good at electronic music.In all, it is a perfect head set I had owned.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it on the Black Friday with very good price.
