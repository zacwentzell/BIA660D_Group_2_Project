    ","I was completely floored by the sound of these headphones.I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile, but I've got good ears.  I'm an amateur musician and music lover.  I own several pairs of headphones and typically prefer Sennheisers.  I've got a pair of HD238s, HD580s, I have some decent JBL earbuds, and I use ATHM50xs for recording.  I listened to a pair of Sony bluetooth headphones that run about $100 more than these - I don't recall the model #.  My buddy had a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 bluetooth phones that I liked (several hundred dollars more than these AKGs).  The only phones that I believe sound objectively better than these are the HD580s.I have had discouraging experiences with bluetooth audio.  I'm not sure how they did it, but these are on par with, or better than wired headphones costing significantly more.  These are closed phones, so the soundstage isn't huge, but it does not sound constricted.  The sound isn't super flat and accurate; actually it is colored - especially in the bass range.  These are a bit bass heavy, but not annoyingly so.  Bass frequencies are warm and focused.  It sounds like there is a slight bump in the upper midrange/low treble - like a bit of presence has been added.  The overall effect is a mix that is vibrant and engaging.  They are never muddy, and instruments are easily resolved.  Listening is a real pleasure.They appear well made, and fit and finish is impressive.  Clamping force is nominal.  The pads are very soft and comfortable.  They stay on my head if I move around, but I couldn't go running with them.  I wouldn't do that with these anyway - I would feel like I'm treating them too harshly.  I haven't worn them for more than an hour or two so far, but I've had no issues with fatigue.  I'm curious to see how my ears feel after wearing them at work all day.  I've yet to find a pair of phones that live up to that challenge.I should add that upon first opening them I charged fully.  They wouldn't turn on at first...I feared the worst and thought they were DOA.  However, pressing on a variety of buttons woke them up somehow and I haven't had any problems since.I'm definitely really happy with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was completely floored by the sound of these headphones.

    ","Very happy with the AKG Y50BT. I like the clarity, battery life, weight and of the feel of the product. The Bluetooth range surprised me. I had my phone in my room and had to go the kitchen and the garage. No signal loss, well, not until I got to the other end of the garage. That's awesome considering there were several walls.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with the AKG Y50BT

    ","Headphones, needs:Privacy so I could listen to music or have telephone conversations over the cellular network without my immediate neighbor hearing the voice of the people. This is especially true during a card game where we have 6 to ten people sitting at one table.Block sounds in my environment ... especially subways, cars and sirens. Many modern headphones I read reviews for did this both physically (with thick pads that seal the wearer's ear canals from outside noise) AND electronically.Finally, twenty hours of battery life so I am not running out at the end of the day, and a cable for those times I don't mind being tethered.The three best units that fulfill these requirements are these:Bose QuietComfort 35 (https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483854780&sr=8-1&keywords=bose+comfort+35) at $350 with great looks, perhaps the best noise cancelling in it's class until recently, and superior comfort.Sennheiser PXC 550 (https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B01E3XLNA0/ref=pd_sim_23_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01E3XLNA0&pd_rd_r=W7PDJ23B2Y7KKRAM1ZB8&pd_rd_w=cdzB6&pd_rd_wg=3PCup&psc=1&refRID=W7PDJ23B2Y7KKRAM1ZB8) $400 for a set from a company known best for excellent sound quality, these have been regarded as best in class sound quality, but bested by the Bose in comfort and noise cancelling until:Sony 1000x (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphone-MDR1000X/dp/B01KHZ4ZYY/ref=pd_sbs_23_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01KHZ4ZYY&pd_rd_r=8MEZSZBMAQA6FQ3Z8NZ9&pd_rd_w=i5bpQ&pd_rd_wg=BcDtd&psc=1&refRID=8MEZSZBMAQA6FQ3Z8NZ9) came out also at $400. It's close, but the consensus seems to be that the Sony has much better noise cancelling and perhaps even better comfort than the Bose, and better sound even than the Sennheisers.All of these models have very good to best in class noise cancellation according to a wide variety of reviews. The AKG's rely entirely on physical isolation rather than digitally constructed noise cancellation. The result is if the AKG's are your choice, you are at the mercy of your environment.However, the sound of the AKG's is superior to both the Bose 35 and the Sony 1000x (the Sony is considered by most to be best in class sound wise) in my opinion. And, if I didn't mention it, at less than half the price.At $150, the sound from these is surprisingly outstanding. Solid bass that doesn't overwhelm the mids, an open high end that doesn't grate, and a open soundstage that is sufficiently large to present an accurate sonic portrait of the musicians and their locations.So the compromise? No electrnoic noise cancelling. To reduce (and not eliminate as the other options mostly do) day to day noise, the AKGs rely entirely on thick ON EAR (not over ear) pads and strong but comfortable pressure.I'm happy. Is the extra money worth the better noise cancelling? I think not, but given that idigital noise cancelling allows one to keep levels down and ear drums intact, I would if the AKG's SOUND wasn't such a winner.Tinnitus (sic) is real, and a real problem as one ages, so do what you can in early life to reduce the risk of middle age hearing loss.I find the Grado SR 60e -- at $80 --(https://www.amazon.com/Grado-SR60e-Headphones/dp/B00KYTNU9U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1483856913&sr=1-1&keywords=grado+sr+60e)are a better overall value and I prefer their sound to all of the others. They have an open back design that has the advantage of a much larger soundstage. Implemented properly, and these are, the sound is completely immersive and listening to these is effortless.Even for your neighbor, which is the downside ... these have zero sound isolation. Hence my decision  to buy the AKG wireless, sealed headphones for travelling about and out. And a little added bass too!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice bass, even mids, clear and crisp hi end. Where's the compromise?"

    ","AKG BlueTooth Headphones ROCK!!!  I got a pair of these in a promotional deal when I purchased the new SamSung Galaxy 8 smartphone.  It came with a bundle of the VR Headset and 256GB memory card.  At first I was skeptical of the quality being good enough for real music listening and considered them just a part of a VR gaming system.  However, after growing up on Sennheiser  audiophile headphones and enjoying B&O cans for years I was shocked at the musical reproduction of these headphones.  They rock my tunes at the gym during my workout on Pandora and have a great tight bass response and crisp, clear highs.  Very loud when you turn them all the way up without distorting and breaking up the bass.  Battery life is extremely good.  I've never run out of battery despite hours of gaming with them and not recharging.  I would say the claims of 15 hour battery life are probably spot on.  I generally just plug them in to charge after a few trips to the gym or playing VR games.  Once I discovered how good they were, my girlfriend had wanted a pair of BEATS for her to wear at the gym, I bought her this silver colored pair for her birthday instead.. She Loves Them!!!  I just don't see the value in spending a extra $150 for BEATS when these headphones sound just as good and offer superior battery life.  They look very cool in black (my pair) or this silver (girlfriend's pair) with the ghost lettering of ""AKG"" on the cans.  Bluetooth range is 30 feet with no breakup using my Samsung Galaxy S8.  Pairing is easy and the volume buttons synch with your phone's volume control.  One button turns them on/off and one button answers/hangs up phone calls.  These headphones are Super Cool!!  I took away a ""star"" because one of the ear pieces came off from use.  It wasn't a big deal to replace, though, it shouldn't just detach itself under normal wear.  Also, they don't have noise cancellation, but, spend about a $100 more and AKG makes a pair that does.Overall, for the money, I don't think you can buy another pair of bluetooth headphones with this quality construction, sound quality, and features for less than $150.  I like the looks of them far better than the BEATS I see others wearing and the battery life is Amazing to me.  The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods with no discomfort to my ears or head after more than an hour at a time.  If I were to buy another pair I would get the noise cancellation only because I think they would be great to wear on a plane.  But, otherwise, I can't think of a single thing I would do to improve these headphones.  AKG BlueTooth Headphones ROCK!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,AKG Bluetooth Headphones ROCK!! AKG vs. BEATS

    ","I work from a home office and have used a pair of Logitech USB headphones to conduct phone calls via VOIP and listen to music while I work. I travel frequently and my poor seven-year-old Logitech's were completely broken down.First, the good:  the sound from the AKG's is fabulous and although retailing at $150, I bought mine on Amazon for $74.Now, the not-so-good:  the on/off button is between the two cans when they are folded together for storage, so during my first real work use they ran out of juice after about 20 minutes while on an important client-proposal phone call. AKG designers could have placed this button just about anywhere else and it would have been better. The other drawback is a positive feature, depending upon how you look at it. The on-ear design does a great job of sealing outside noises (passive noise cancelling, if you will), which is an advantage while listening to music.  While speaking on the phone however, it provides a sensation like talking with your fingers in your ears. Now, I'm sure this is something I will get used to or perhaps I will talk less and listen more. I know many people who would have bought these for me ten years ago if they knew it would have that kind of impact.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, one minor design flaw"

    ","UPDATE: I've just downgraded my review to 2 stars. After a year of using these, one of the ear cups has fallen apart. I'm stunned that they couldn't withstand the same treatment that my previous AKG headphones endured, and now, instead of replacing a wire, I have replace the entire unit.I've had these headphones for 8+ months and I've been very satisfied with them. In that time, I've used them almost every day either at home or at work. My main uses are for music, either connected to a Mac or an iPhone, and occasionally for streaming video. I purchased them to replace a pair of AKG K450s that I loved, but was tired of replacing the cables for. (I'll make a lot of comparisons to my previous wired headphones through this review.)While the sound has not been as good as the K450, it's been good enough. The Bluetooth audio's biggest issue for me is that it favours the low end. It seems to be an issue with the BT audio, as the sound of these is brighter and closer to the character of the K450s when the bypass cable is plugged in. I'm not an audiophile, and listen mostly to high quality compressed music, but I spend a lot of time listening and have been able to enjoy my music with these. (Maybe not as much as with the K450, but ah well.) When using them to watch video, the syncing may not be exact, but it's close enough for casual viewing.Compared to other Bluetooth headphones I'd tried, these were the most comfortable. Understandably heavier than the K450, but just as compact. They sit fairly gently on my head, and I don't feel much pressure against my ears.I think I can usually get between 8-10 hours of listening per charge. Unfortunately, this leads me to my biggest issue with them: you cannot use them wirelessly while the USB charging cable is plugged in. Which means that once the battery dies, you have to choose between continuing to listen with the bypass cable, taking them off and charging them, or wearing them with two cables connected. I'd previously used a pair of Bluetooth headphones that allowed for listening during USB charging, so this was quite disappointing, and the biggest reason why they don't get 4 stars from me.Another minor design complaint is that unlike the K450s, these have mesh over the speaker hole in the cup, and sometimes you can hear that mesh rubbing against your skin and hair.Overall, if you're not looking for audiophile perfection (which I don't think you can yet find in wireless anyway), and like me, you're tired of replacing headphone cables, the AKG Y45s are a good, solid option for on-the-ear Bluetooth headphones. I have no regrets about buying these, despite some annoyances. I can't quite bring myself to give them 4 stars, but I'd give them 3.5 if I could.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"A solid option for on-the-ear wireless, but far from perfect"

    ",For  a bluetooth stereo headset this one is fantastic.  Hubby is an audiophile nut job and I can't begin to state how much money he has spent on 'cans' over the years. Oh I could but I'd just start thinking about all the things that money could have been used for.  These are the only bluetooth wireless headsets that he will alllow to adorn his big noggin with when he's away from the high end toys that of course use oxygen free cables ..I think that's what he called them..anyway this is a great headset...,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even Audiophile Nut Job Hubby approves

    ","I usually use a pair of grado SR-60s at home which I love and think are well balanced for my taste music I like (indie, classical, 60s soul, some IDM). Those don't work for the office because of the open air design, so I use Standard apple earbuds. At first seems these seemed overly bassy and a little muddy, but after a couple of days realized I was probably used to tinny Apple earbuds, and pairs really fast with iPhone 6 iOS10, all button gestures work well. Everyone has already mentioned that these sound good, so I will mention that they block sound in my office well (half the reason I got them). They are a little heavy but I got used to that quickly. Battery is still going after the first charge 3 days ago. Bag is neoprene. When used with included cord, sound the same to my ears. I tried a pair of $400 Bluetooth Beats at target and really don't think they could be worth the extra $280, especially because the music most people listen to is probably compressed anyway. My only negative is that they don't fold much for being foldable, and if they lie flat around your neck, the speakers point up which is distracting if taking them off for a quick conversation. The power button is also easy to hit when folding for storage. These are minor complaints. Considering most reputable brand BT headphones are $70-100, at $119 these seem like a nice step up from overly bassy Skullcandy and a much cheaper option than Beats.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, they do sound great.

    ","I looked for high quality sound, folding on-ear, comfortable,  wireless Bluetooth, professionally built, with NFC that can be used on both phones, tablets or comps and I have found the AKG Y45BT.  The quality of the of the headphones sound is awesome! The frequency range is  amazing. Unlike many other headphone, where the low frequencies are  artificially amplified, so the ""bass"" sounds strong, here with the AKG Y45BT, the low frequencies are NOT too loud but CRISP. Other famous brand name sells a similar headphones for a price twice higher. The extra charge in this case is for its name only, not for the compared quality of sound and specifications. So buy smart.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Pleasure For Your Ears at a Reasonable Price

    ","I bought this recently.  Tried it on for 2 day, and ended up returning it.  (Amazon return policy is excellent btw.)  I found the headphone uncomfortable to use, after ~30min of wear.  I have a small head and I've found the headphone to be squishing my ears.  I think my next pair will be over-the-ears.  For what it's worth, I do like the product styling, the material finish is solid, and great sound quality.  The BT pairing was a breeze.  The volume quality will take some getting use to, to locate the buttons, but heck, I only had this headphone for a very short time.  I'd consider buying AKG again.

    ","I'm totally amazed at the sound quality of these headphones.  I do hear a slight hiss which I believe to be coming from the amp in the headphone when it gets a signal from the phone and activates, but the overall sound quality is clean and crisp, with clear detailed sound through out the range, can't really say that it sounds forward or heavy to any degree.  I'd call the sound neutral but dynamic, and not so much that the bass is over done, but think of it like a system where you have large woofers, and even bigger subwoofers, however, these are tuned, so the bass has impact, but it's not boomy/bloomy, it goes deep with detail/texture.  I wasn't expecting sound like this, and again it's so clean over Bluetooth, I use these with my phone, my desktop and two laptops, and all of them are in sync when watching videos, so no BT lag, or it's minimal enough to be a non-issue.

    ","This is my first set of bluetooth headphones and I love em. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do like clear sounding headphones that balance out the range of tones well. The bass feels hefty and the voices clear - the sound is very well balanced overall(especially for it's size and pricetag). I've owned a pair of V-Moda crossfades and while this doesn't reach that level of clarity and depth, it's half the price and doesn't make me feel like I have a pair of weights on my ears.I was hesitant at first because I've only owned over the ear headphones before and didn't know if I would like the fit of on the ear headphones. But in the end, I like these better than the V-Moda set as far as comfort and wearability goes. It's something that I can take pretty much anywhere I go and don't feel I have to watch over it like an overprotective parent.I haven't run into any troubles with the bluetooth as far as pairing goes(I've used it with my iphone, my macbook. and a surface pro no problem). The range of it is about 20-30 feet and works well between rooms. As far as the fit they're pretty snug - I haven't had them fall off accidentally once. But I haven't done any strenuous activities like jogging or bootcamp with it, but for everyday use it works just fine and I'm sure I could wear them around the gym as long as I'm not jumping around a lot. Would highly recommend",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding set of Headphones.

The second, which I'm not sure is the headphones fault or my devices, but the audio play back can be choppy sometimes. I have found a fix for this on my computers, you simply have to reset the Bluetooth module then reconnect the headphones. After doing so I don't have any of the choppy audio or hissing. You can do this on a mac by holding down option+shift and then clicking on the Bluetooth icon in the task bar, going to debug and then reset Bluetooth module.

    ","You hear the trap sounds from drummer Harvey Mason, those little incidental noises he makes as he moves around his kit in Herbie Hancock's Chameleon. You also pick out the hammer strikes as Esbjorn Svensson plays piano with his trio in From Gagarin's Point of View.The Y50BT 'phones put you in the control room with the engineer, listening to studio performances as the musicians lay them down.They reveal all the drum trap and piano hammer sounds, plus everything else, very cleanly. And they have very balanced bass, realistically present without thumping the heck out of me. Mids and treble are balanced too.I'm perhaps a bit pickier than many people, having been a professional keyboard player and the guy who fixed the band's sound system in my younger years.

    ","These headphones are surprising. I'm going to do a comprehensive review on them since there is probably a lot of interest from the Samsung Pre Order.Design :Design is nice. The headphones are plastic which I don't mind, and fit very comfortably on the ear. There is nothing uncomfortable about them when you wear you can wear for hours. However if you're going out for a walk or something these may be a bit bulky and awkward to wear out but then again that's style related. I usually feel odd wearing more than earbuds when I'm out and about. I'm disappointed they use micro usb. Anything new and premium should have USB C and it should have the port covered. I've written many head phone reviews in my day and the open charging port always annoys me as it cuts the life of the cans short. It does have a bypass cord and so the cans can be used blue tooth free which is always nice. I sure love having a headphone jack.Sound:I'm giving these a 7 out of ten for the price range. They are clearly bass oriented and that annoys my inner purist. I saw people complaining it needed even more bass. People, let the studios mix the songs k? The mids can get washed out a bit but that's nothing a good equalizer can't fix and the highs and mids and lows are pretty evenly proportioned considered the low end tuning. I think for most people these will be sufficient boom unless they literally just think ear rattling means quality.Volume on these depends on what you're using. They're moderately set up for hi fi so don't expect much of you're streaming Pandora. You may need to get some losses audio or try a higher fi streaming service like Tidal. You will get a much fuller louder sound if youre actually listening to lossless. That's why sources are important. It works with Pandora but it will be weak and you didn't get these bad boys to listen to A Thousand Years right? So download some lossless. You know you want too. They really perform well with the hi fi source material.Battery Life :Battery life is decent. It could be a bit better, but it gets the job done. Depends on end user usage. The bypass cable will make sure you won't end up having to talk to anyone on the bus though.What You Need To Know:Akg is a reputable brand but it does tune closer to the low end. These have a great sound with lossless audio. Charge them carefully. They also come with a bag. For the price they are a pretty good deal and are more for beginner base heads. If you're purchasing out of pocket you may want to see what else is out there first, but if you want reputable blue tooth cans now than this might be your jam. I don't think you'd regret the purchase, but there are a lot more headphones in the sea at this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Cans, Not The Best."

    ","My best sounding headphones by far are the AKG Y50BT, which came with the $99 Samsung promotion.  Their frequency response curves are sick; basically flat across with accents just where you want them.  Such excellent lows, and balanced very well.  Mid - excellent.  Highs - excellent.  Way, way better that 20hz to 20khz would suggest.  But I can't wear them long.  They're not uncomfortable.  I can wear them longer than other non in-ear headphones.  I actually thought they were light when I first tried them.  But I can't tolerate non-earbud headphones very long.Useful headphone reviews need comparison.  The Samsung AKG OEM in-ear, Advanced Model 3, and AKG Y50BT are my 3 go-to high-fidelity headphones.  I get different things from each, and each are brilliant in their own way.I love the Model 3s, but these beat them in every category except comfort.That said, Model 3s have a powerful low end and high highs (on part with in-ear AKGs),  They're convertible wired to wireless.  Sub is almost too powerful, which can mask the bass on some songs, but they're otherwise pretty well balanced.  Soundstage is not as open as AKG in-ear, but bring a different dimension in hi-fidelity sound.  They sound like high-end monitors when you get a good ear bud fit (silicone works much better than foam for me).  And they're bluetooth which frees me when doing chores where the cord doesn't snag every few minutes.I also want to acknowledge how excellent the Galaxy S8+ original AKG in-ear buds are!  Excellently balanced with a nice low end and excellent high end (I can't distinguish highs from these AKG Y50BTs), beautifully engaging and open sound stage, no fuss fit, great sound seal without being isolating, anti-tangle cord... I could go on and on.  The in-ear AKG's are so good and very underrated, despite their decent reviews.Still, AKG Y50BTs are better in almost every category except comfort and soundstage (openness).  $130 is a very fair price for the sound you get.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb sound!

    ","Ive  got about 15 pair of headphones ranging from Bose soundlink on ear headphones to Polk hinge to  Jbl50s , Monster Adidas ,Sol Republicmaster tracks, Airfi . Id say my favorite is the Adidas for over the ear. Better base and nice tone. The Akg is my favorite on ear the highs are clear and not exaggerated like the Republic sols the Bose on ears are one of my least favorite headphones, I  prefer the Polk hinge even over the Bose soundlink. The most interesting comparison to me is the Jbl 50s  and the Akgs i think the sound is very close with the highs being better on the Akgs where the base is better on the Jbls. Though i will prolly usually the Akgs more because they are much more comfortable then the Jbls,Though im betting anyone that has the Jbls 700 elites wouldnt touch the Akgs.. I paid 58 dollars for my Akg y50s. So im not sure compairing them to a 300 dollar pair of headphones is fair, The build quality seems good in a world of plastics.

If you are okay with that kind, these would probably do great for you.Wired and wireless quality seem pretty close, the signal is also very strong for bt 3.0.Battery life - I've never had any issues with the battery life or charging time.The only issue I have (and I'd ding about half a star) is the EXCESSIVELY aggressive connection.  The location of the power button leaves it prone to turn itself on should it get jostled.  When on, it will connect to a device in range and hold the connection.  If you disconnect it from the device, it will forcibly reconnect itself in a minute or two, overriding any other connection.  The only way to stop it is to un-pair it, or actually turn them off.  This is a major problem for myself as I typically keep them packed with my laptop and are usually nearby, and regularly I have my phone hijacked from use with my earbuds or car.AKG - move the power button or make the headphones let go when they are forcibly disconnected in future versions.

    ","AKG, a is a company known for premium microphones and headphones. It is an Austrian company that has expanded internationally over the decades. So these AKG Y45 headphones have a heritage from a company that knows good sound. When I received these for review, I was anxious to try this on-the-ear design. My previous headphone experiences involved over the ear (Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro) headphones, inner ear monitors (Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi 10 Pro), and Apple ear buds.The packaging of these headphones is admirable. They are nicely boxed and include all cables and a zippered cloth pouch. There was no manual included, other than a quick start sheet. The controls and features are straightforward, so an in-depth manual is not required for most. Nowhere could I find where these phones were made. The materials are upscale and possibly they are assembled in China, but that is just my guess.The phones themselves are impressive. These are not cheap plastic phones. The headband surfaces are nicely padded along the surface that touches the head. The upper surface is a soft touch rubber. The ear pads feel like soft leather. The cups adjust on metal bands that pull down from the upper unit.The controls are reasonably laid out. When the phones are on your head, it is easy to find the volume +/- buttons, and the raised button between them. This button will pause the music being played. When paired with my iPod Touch, holding this button down invokes Siri. There is one other button placed lower on the right cup that will initiate pairing with your bluetooth device. Also, is you hold the volume + button down, the volume increases and then beeps when it hits the maximum volume.If you don’t want to use bluetooth with this headset, you have the option to use the provided bypass cord to plug the phones into the headphone plug on your device.Besides the intelligent layout of the controls, the phones have gimbaled cups that rotate and angle to fit the head comfortably. They can fold to a very compact form that fits well in the carry pouch. These are nice phones to take on a trip. Nothing feels cheap about them. But, how do they sound?I listened to these phones for hours, trying to pin down a good description of the sound I heard. The first impression I got was how deep the bass extended. The specs say list a range of 17hz up to 20000hz. 17hz is below the threshold of human hearing, so I don’t see the wisdom in claiming this spec. Let’s just say, if you like to hear the deep bass tones of your music, these phones will deliver. Moving on up to the midrange, I was impressed with the presence and warmth of vocals. The only criticism is the bass sometimes effected the lower registers of female voices; bothers me, but probably not an issue for many. I didn't felt that this was boomy, artificial bass, but it was pronounced.Now, the upper range of frequencies. Here, the phones rolled off the higher frequencies where they sounded restrained. The sound was there but lacked a crispness and definition that is so important in defining the character of many instruments. You could not experience the hissing of cymbals, or thwack of a snare drum. Also, the harmonics of bells and triangles were limited in range.With that said, if I turned the volume up, the overall result was rich and satisfying sound, albeit lacking accuracy.  I found I could listen comfortably to many different types of music. The fact that these are bluetooth phones means you don’t have to be tethered to your music source. For many, this may be a great feature. The range of these phones is good, and I was able to walk around the main floor of the house without much interference.  AKG markets these phones to appeal to the fashion sense of wearers who want to ‘make heads turn while you make a powerful statement’. If you are an audiophile who wants neutral, accurate sound, then look further.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"A well-made, good looking headphone for bass lovers"

    ","I previously thought I would not like on-ear headphones, but having tried a few pair recently I have changed my mind.  Love how small and compact they are, light enough to not feel anything, and really the ear discomfort I thought I would have has not really shown up.  Bluetooth is also great because it removes the need for cords, connects easily, lets you control your device, even use it as a mic.I recently got a pair of Bose Soundlink Bluetooth headphones as well, which are very similar to these albeit for a $100 increase in price.  This is what I will be comparing these to for most of the review.- Sound: These sound great, a tiny hiss when the audio starts from my phone, but this is the same I hear in all bluetooth headphones.  AKG is a good quality brand, usually with an emphasis on sound, and this shows here.- Build: Lots of metal, ear cups rotate all the way flat to make these super easy to store. Ear cups themselves are quite dense and hard right now, but I have a feeling they will break in nicely.- Comfort: Not as great as the Bose, mostly due to the hard ear cups and smaller head band.- Buttons: I hate these buttons.  The on/off switch is not a slider, it's a button you have to press, and of course when you are wearing them you have no clue if you are hitting the button correctly, but the beeps that are sounded don't clearly communicate what it is doing.  If you take them off you will see there is a red light that turns on.  The volume up/down and play/pause/etc buttons are near impossible to locate easily, and even when you do it's really hard to tell which one you are using.  The Bose are a mile ahead in this regard, tactile buttons, super simple didn't even have to think.  These are incredibly frustrating, enough to drop a star even if they are quite a bit cheaper.- Audio Alerts: Just beeps, and not different tons, just a few beeps for on and a few for off.  No clue about battery life, or what it connected to, etc.  The Bose shine in this regard, telling you battery life via audio, what you are connected to, what it is doing (i.e. trying to reconnect), etc.Overall they are great, but I can't get over how bad the usability on the buttons are, that small change would make these so much better for me to use.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, Horrible Buttons"

    ","This is a smart little set of headphones with very good sound. While I prefer an ""around-the-ear"" set, there are some advantages to this type (weight, comfort, etc.) that give the user options which might not be available otherwise. Most other sets do not have a volume control on-board, an on/off switch, and the added wireless or wired options make this set superior (in it's technology) to my favorite pair of all time (Klipsch Image ONE Premium On-Ear Earphones).Sound: These have a very good sound quality in both high and mid-range, with solid bass tones (bass being one of the biggest areas most smaller headphones lose out on). Compared to the Klipsch set, I'd say these are a close second with some clarity over that pair added when the set is wireless. Hard to describe, but the signal seems more immediate and there is a very clear separation of instruments and crisp details emerge that get somewhat muffled on other pairs. I listened to Stevie Wonder's ""Songs in the Key of Life"" and heard things I had not heard previously on one of his most lush productions, for instance.Signal: I had a clear signal everywhere in my mid-sized ranch house. However, when I opened the garage entrance, things got sketchy.  According to the Bluetooth.com website: ""Bluetooth technology sends information within your Personal Area Network or PAN (aka your own personal space) at distances up to 100 meters (328 feet).""  This set of headphones does not get close to that measurement, I'd say the signal broke up at about 48 feet or so. Not bad for just being in the house and wanting wireless technology, but you aren't going to be able to mow the grass or work in your yard without some trouble.Comfort: This pair is OK, not horrible, not great. Compared to the Klipsch set, they aren't nearly as comfortable and didn't behave themselves nearly as well. There seemed to be a weight problem on the top band, no matter how I adjusted the tightness, it seemed to flop down when I bent over. I wore these for about 2 hours with no negative physical effects, however. Not too hot around the ear, no headache from being squeezed. I think you could do basic work with them, but probably not dance or exercise vigorously.This set comes with both a re-charge USB cable and a bypass cable for a direct signal. Also a nice carrying case for travel.For the price and the built-in technology, this is a solid set of headphones that I would recommend for around the house when you need wireless sound.

    ","First of all, the design is just beautiful. The overall size is not too big, but rather small, and it fits perfect on my small head. And because of the small form factor, it doesn't slide down from my head when I move around. It was also perfect when walking/jogging on the street. I wore this headphone for a couple of hours to see if I felt any discomfort or ache on my ears and head. This headphone is the most comfortable one I've ever tried. This headphone is small, but the tension around my ears and head is just enough to hang strong to  avoid sliding. The ear pads are very soft, cushiony and leather-ish, and they didn't irritate my ears at all. ( No aches, pinches, or uncomfortable and noticeable rings around my ears were present.) My set is white and light brown colored, and I love the natural color combination of this. It doesn't look cheap; it looks luxurious and very stylish. This is the headphone I can wear anywhere I want, and I don't feel embarrassed by the look of it (I have owned some far too stylish headsets before, but this one is perfect!). If you look into other headphones, believe or not, some are really ugly and some are just uggggh. I liked Beats headphones because they kind of pioneered the design side of the headphone business. Now with this Y45BT headphone in my hands, I think AKG fine tuned the highly well-designed headphone design.Secondly, let's discuss the bluetooth connectivity and sound quality. It took about 10 seconds to pair with my iPhone, and I didn't have to do anything else. With the bluetooth turned on in my phone, as soon as the headphone powers on, the headphone and phone connect with each other quickly and disconnect when the power goes off. My phone doesn't have NFC support, so I haven't been able to try NFC connectivity, but I am sure it will be as simple as it can be.So how's the sound quality via bluetooth? Well, as far as I know, connecting wirelessly via bluetooth has its limitations in both bandwidth and range, so this headphone is not an exception when connected via bluetooth. I didn't expect hi fidelity or anything, but I concluded that I have to agree on what AKG claims on the description of the product. It says `high performance'. Whether they meant high performance in sound quality or high performance in anything else, the sound quality is way better than several of my bluetooth headphones I've been using for a long time. I was actually surprised that the bluetooth audio technology improved as much as it has. There's no background noise or buzzing sound like my other BT headphones makes. When connected with the included audio cable, the sound gets little bit better (and doesn't require battery powered on).Lastly, using this headphone on phone calls is convenient. While listening to music, if phone rings, the music stops and the ringtone plays. And without taking out my phone to answer the call, I just press the center button (between volume up and down, just like the Apple earphone remote buttons.) Phone call audio quality, as I tested on both ends (as a caller and receiver) was pretty good. I experienced in the past that many bluetooth headphones had really low microphone level, so the other party  on the phone had a hard time hearing me talk. With this headphone, I did not have the kind of issue I had before with other BT headphones. Call quality was wonderful as well as the the regular sound quality.The battery is built in, and it's not replaceable. The initial full recharge took about an hour and the battery lasted more than five hours of continuous usage. (I think it lasted longer actually, but I fell asleep with the headphone on.) When the battery died, recharging took a couple of hours. One thing I found very convenient was that while the headphone was paired and in use, it showed the battery level right next to the BT icon on my iPhone. And, if the music paused for a certain period of time, the headphone disconnected the pairing and conserved the battery power.Overall, this is very well designed and well made bluetooth headphone that doesn't suck the sound quality too much. I have several stereo bluetooth headphones (Sony, Motorola, and LG) and this is the most comfortable, convenient, beautiful, and pleasing sound quality headphone with long lasting built in battery power.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"finally, a beautiful BT headphone that is not disappointing"

In comparison to my Bose QC3's that also offered faux leather padding, the QC3's are far more comfortable.  The headset adjustment doesn't offer sufficient slack so unless you have an extremely small head, you are going to hurt.Failure to offer a rich, engaging sound stage is my #2 reason for returning this set - I am well aware that BT headphones cannot compare with wired one in a sound quality contest but having been spoilt by my QC3's the AKG sounded flat, trebles were ok but hardly any bass.

    ","These are definitely more fashion headphones than anything else.  I have the white pair with the brown accents, and I think they look really nice, although they're a bit small.  Guys with big heads might have trouble getting these to fit comfortably.  From the point of view as a fashion accessory, I think that the Y45BTs are probably more for women.On the right earpiece, you get a 2.5mm line-in for the passthrough cable, the microphone, power LED, and buttons for power, volume up, down, and a multifunction button.  The left side has a USB charging port and another LED indicator.  The multifunction button is context sensitive so if you're receiving a phone call, you can answer with one press and hang up with another.  If you're playing music, you can play/pause with one press, skip to the next track with a double press, and jump back to the previous track with a triple press.  I tested out the button in iTunes on my Macbook Pro, and it worked great.The build quality is actually really nice.  The two earpieces can turn flat and pivot inwards for easy storage.  The leather headband and ear pads are soft feel very high quality, and even with my big head, I don't feel like my ears are getting pinched.  I don't think they feel any more flimsy thanAudio quality pretty decent, but I expected something a bit better from AKG at this price range.  I'm not an audiophile, but I love my relatively cheap Grado SR-60s which are definitely better than these.The biggest problem that I have with these headphones is the faint hissing sound, which has been an issue with every wireless headphone set that I've ever owned.  It's much less noticeable when music is playing, and I could almost get used it if it were constant, but it comes and goes as the headset switches in and out of sleep mode when there's no input.  To make matters worse, when my iPhone goes into sleep mode, there's a periodic, electronic whining sound that comes from the left earpiece.  I have these same issues when the headphones are paired with my Mac Pro, so it's definitely not a device specific problem.  The hissing all goes away when you use the included 3.5mm to 2.5mm pass-through cable.The hissing and squealing noises are definitely noticeable to me, mainly because I knew what to listen for.  I've had these same issues with two other pairs of wireless headphones in the past, and I was hoping that AKG had figured out a solution.  I'm guessing that some people wouldn't mind it though, and if you can get over the hissing sound, these are fashionable, albeit pricey, headphones that will look great with your fancy new iPhone while you hang out at your local Starbucks.  If you're looking for good sound quality, I'd still recommend a regular pair of corded headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hisses when paired over Bluetooth, occasional electronic squeaking when there's no input"

They clamp on to my head and pinch my ears against my glasses.A real shame, because I think they sound good as far as Bluetooth headphones go.Battery is good, buttons work. Holding the ""play"" button will activate Google voice search on Android phones.Just wish they fit my fat head.",2.0 out of 5 stars,because I think they sound good as far as Bluetooth headphones go

    ",Got these with the ultimate experience when i preordered my samsung s8+ these headphones are broken in blue tooth. ZERO sound comes out of them. tried on other phones and devices as well. NO sound. and they are paired and volume and settings properly setup. my Bluedio UFOS work like a charm compared to this junk. They only work wired so theres that but going to sell these on ebay for $100 who wants them?,1.0 out of 5 stars,my Bluedio UFOS work like a charm compared to this junk

    ","I really wanted to love these headphones - they have amazing, rich sound, fold nicely to fit in my messenger bag during my commute, and were pretty comfortable. But the bluetooth connection is awful, impossible to sync with my iPad or iPhone without making multiple attempts. And the charger doesn't work consistently. I bought these once, and when I had these problems I trekked back to the store to exchange them. But then the second pair was just as bad. Shame ... but these are going back! Way too overpriced to be so impossible to operate.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful bluetooth connection, impossible to recharge battery, not worth the money!"
